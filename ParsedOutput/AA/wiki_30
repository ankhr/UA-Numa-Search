Battle of Bosworth Field

The Battle of Bosworth Field (or Battle of Bosworth) was the last significant battle of the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, the <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a> between the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Houses of Lancaster</a> and <a href="House%20of%20York">York</a> that raged across <a href="England">England</a> in the latter half of the <a href="15th%20century">15th century</a>. Fought on 22 August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians. Their leader <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond</a>, by his victory became the first English monarch of the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a>. His opponent, <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard III</a>, the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle. Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">Plantagenet dynasty</a>, making it a defining moment of English and Welsh history.

Richard's reign began in 1483. At the request of his brother Edward IV, Richard was acting as <a href="Lord%20Protector">Lord Protector</a> for his son Edward V. Richard had Parliament declare Edward V illegitimate and ineligible for the throne, and took it for himself. Richard lost popularity when the boy and his younger brother disappeared after he incarcerated them in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, and his support was further eroded by the popular belief that he was implicated in the death of his wife. Across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a>, Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties so that he could challenge his claim to the throne. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but on his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of <a href="Market%20Bosworth">Market Bosworth</a> in Leicestershire. <a href="Thomas%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Thomas, Lord Stanley</a>, and <a href="William%20Stanley%20%28Battle%20of%20Bosworth%29">Sir William Stanley</a> brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.

Richard divided his army, which outnumbered Henry's, into three groups (or "battles"). One was assigned to the <a href="John%20Howard%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a> and another to the <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Earl of Northumberland</a>. Henry kept most of his force together and placed it under the command of the experienced <a href="John%20de%20Vere%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">Earl of Oxford</a>. Richard's vanguard, commanded by Norfolk, attacked but struggled against Oxford's men, and some of Norfolk's troops fled the field. Northumberland took no action when signalled to assist his king, so Richard gambled everything on a charge across the battlefield to kill Henry and end the fight. Seeing the king's knights separated from his army, the Stanleys intervened; Sir William led his men to Henry's aid, surrounding and killing Richard. After the battle Henry was crowned king below an oak tree in nearby Stoke Golding, now a residential garden.

Henry hired chroniclers to portray his reign favourably; the Battle of Bosworth was popularised to represent the Tudor dynasty as the start of a new age. From the 15th to the 18th centuries the battle was glamorised as a victory of good over evil. The climax of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" provides a focal point for critics in later film adaptations. The exact site of the battle is disputed because of the lack of conclusive data, and memorials have been erected at different locations. In 1974 the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on a site that has since been challenged by several scholars and historians. In October 2009 a team of researchers, who had performed geological surveys and archaeological digs in the area from 2003, suggested a location southwest of <a href="Ambion%20Hill">Ambion Hill</a>.

During the 15th century civil war raged across England as the <a href="House%20of%20York">Houses of York</a> and <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a> fought each other for the English throne. In 1471 the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Barnet">Barnet</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tewkesbury">Tewkesbury</a>. The Lancastrian <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">King Henry VI</a> and his only son, <a href="Edward%20of%20Westminster%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Edward of Lancaster</a>, died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne. The Yorkist king, <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a>, was in complete control of England. He <a href="Attainder">attainted</a> those who refused to submit to his rule, such as <a href="Jasper%20Tudor">Jasper Tudor</a> and his nephew <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry</a>, naming them traitors and confiscating their lands. The Tudors tried to flee to France but strong winds forced them to land in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a>, then a semi-independent duchy, where they were taken into the custody of <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Duke Francis II</a>. Henry's mother, <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Beaufort">Lady Margaret Beaufort</a>, was a great-granddaughter of <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt</a>, uncle of <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">King Richard II</a> and father of <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">King Henry IV</a>. The Beauforts were originally <a href="Bastard%20%28Law%20of%20England%20and%20Wales%29">bastards</a>, but Henry IV legitimised them on the condition that their descendants were not eligible to inherit the throne. Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of the royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne, and Edward regarded him as "a nobody". The Duke of Brittany, however, viewed Henry as a valuable tool to bargain for England's aid in conflicts with France and kept the Tudors under his protection.

Edward IV died 12 years after Tewkesbury on 9 April 1483. His 12-year-old elder son succeeded him as <a href="Edward%20V%20of%20England">King Edward V</a>; the younger son, nine-year-old <a href="Richard%20of%20Shrewsbury%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20York">Richard of Shrewsbury</a>, was next in line to the throne. Edward V was <a href="Regency%20%28government%29">too young to rule</a> and a <a href="Royal%20Council">Royal Council</a> was established to rule the country until the king's coming of age. The royal court was worried when it learned that the Woodvilles, relatives of Edward IV's widow <a href="Elizabeth%20Woodville">Elizabeth</a>, were plotting to seize control of the council. Having offended many in their quest for wealth and power, the Woodville family was not popular. To frustrate the Woodvilles' ambitions, <a href="William%20Hastings%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hastings">Lord Hastings</a> and other members of the council turned to the new king's uncle—Richard, <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Duke of Gloucester</a>, brother of Edward IV. The courtiers urged Gloucester to assume the role of Protector quickly, as had been previously requested by his now dead brother. On 29 April Gloucester, accompanied by a contingent of guards and <a href="Henry%20Stafford%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham</a>, took Edward V into custody and arrested several prominent members of the Woodville family. After bringing the young king to London, Gloucester had two of the Woodvilles (the Queen's brother <a href="Anthony%20Woodville%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Rivers">Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers</a> and her younger son by her first marriage <a href="Richard%20Grey">Richard Grey</a>) executed, without trial, on charges of treason.

On 13 June Gloucester accused Hastings of plotting with the Woodvilles and had him beheaded. Nine days later Gloucester convinced <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> to declare the marriage between Edward IV and Elizabeth illegal, rendering their children illegitimate and disqualifying them from the throne. With his brother's children out of the way, he was next in the line of succession and was proclaimed King Richard III on 26 June. The timing and extrajudicial nature of the deeds done to obtain the throne for Richard won him no popularity, and rumours that spoke ill of the new king spread throughout England. After they were declared bastards, the two princes were confined in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> and never seen in public again.

Discontent with Richard's actions manifested itself in the summer after he took control of the country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian <a href="Charles%20Ross%20%28historian%29">Charles Ross</a> proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.
The plan was to stage uprisings within a short time in southern and western England, overwhelming Richard's forces. Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea. Bad timing and weather wrecked the plot. An uprising in <a href="Kent">Kent</a> started 10 days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps to put down the insurrections. Richard's spies informed him of Buckingham's activities, and the king's men captured and destroyed the bridges across the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a>. When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it swollen and impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15 October. Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army. The duke abandoned his plans and fled to <a href="Wem">Wem</a>, where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard's men. On 2 November 1483 he was executed. Henry had attempted a landing on 10 October (or 19 October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm. He reached the coast of England (at either <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> or <a href="Poole">Poole</a>) and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore. They were, in fact, Richard's men, prepared to capture Henry once he set foot on English soil. Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion. Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.

The survivors of the failed uprisings fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry's claim to the throne. At Christmas, Henry Tudor swore an oath to marry Edward IV's daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20York">Elizabeth of York</a>, to unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster. Henry's rising prominence made him a great threat to Richard, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to the Duke of Brittany to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from Richard. In mid-1484 Francis was incapacitated by illness and while recuperating, his treasurer <a href="Pierre%20Landais">Pierre Landais</a> took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with Richard to send back Henry and his uncle in exchange for military and financial aid. John Morton, a bishop of <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors, who fled to France. The French court allowed them to stay; the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that Richard's England did not interfere with French plans to annex Brittany. On 16 March 1485 Richard's queen, <a href="Anne%20Neville">Anne Neville</a>, died, and rumours spread across the country that she was murdered to pave the way for Richard to marry his niece, Elizabeth. The gossip alienated Richard from some of his northern supporters, and upset Henry across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. The loss of Elizabeth's hand in marriage could unravel the alliance between Henry's supporters who were Lancastrians and those who were loyalists to Edward IV. Anxious to secure his bride, Henry recruited mercenaries formerly in French service to supplement his following of exiles and set sail from France on 1 August.

By the 15th century English <a href="chivalry">chivalric</a> ideas of selfless service to the king had been <a href="Bastard%20feudalism">corrupted</a>. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in individual estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his <a href="Militia%20%28English%29">militia</a>. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through the support of his nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.

Small and slender, Richard III did not have the robust physique associated with many of his Plantagenet predecessors. However, he enjoyed very rough sports and activities that were considered manly. His performances on the battlefield impressed his brother greatly, and he became Edward's right-hand man. During the 1480s Richard defended the northern borders of England. In 1482 Edward charged him to lead an army into Scotland with the aim of replacing <a href="James%20III%20of%20Scotland">King James III</a> with the <a href="Alexander%20Stewart%2C%20Duke%20of%20Albany">Duke of Albany</a>. Richard's army <a href="Capture%20of%20Berwick%20%281482%29">broke through the Scottish defences and occupied the capital</a>, Edinburgh, but Albany decided to give up his claim to the throne in return for the post of Lieutenant General of Scotland. As well as obtaining a guarantee that the Scottish government would concede territories and diplomatic benefits to the English crown, Richard's campaign retook the town of <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, which the Scots had conquered in 1460. Edward was not satisfied by these gains, which, according to Ross, could have been greater if Richard had been resolute enough to capitalise on the situation while in control of Edinburgh. In her analysis of Richard's character, Christine Carpenter sees him as a soldier who was more used to taking orders than giving them. However, he was not averse to displaying his militaristic streak; on ascending the throne he made known his desire to lead a <a href="Crusades">crusade</a> against "not only the Turks, but all [his] foes".

Richard's most loyal subject was <a href="John%20Howard%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk</a>. The duke had served Richard's brother for many years and had been one of Edward IV's closer confidants. He was a military veteran, having fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Towton">Battle of Towton</a> in 1461 and served as Hastings' deputy at Calais in 1471. Ross speculates that he may have borne a grudge against Edward for depriving him of a fortune. Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old <a href="Anne%20de%20Mowbray%2C%208th%20Countess%20of%20Norfolk">Anne de Mowbray</a>, the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne. Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.

<a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland</a>, also supported Richard's seizure of the throne of England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom. From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace. Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was promised he would be the <a href="Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Marches">Warden of the East March</a>, a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys. He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure of being in a position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship. However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, <a href="John%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lincoln">John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln</a>, to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position. According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated, he despaired of any possibility of advancement under Richard.

Henry Tudor was unfamiliar with the arts of war and a stranger to the land he was trying to conquer. He spent the first fourteen years of his life in Wales and the next fourteen in Brittany and France. Slender but strong and decisive, Henry lacked a penchant for battle and was not much of a warrior; chroniclers such as <a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a> and ambassadors like <a href="Pedro%20de%20Ayala">Pedro de Ayala</a> found him more interested in commerce and finance. Having not fought in any battles, Henry recruited several experienced veterans on whom he could rely for military advice and the command of his armies. 

<a href="John%20de%20Vere%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford</a>, was Henry's principal military commander. He was adept in the arts of war. At the Battle of Barnet, he commanded the Lancastrian right wing and routed the division opposing him. However, as a result of confusion over identities, Oxford's group came under <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> from the Lancastrian main force and retreated from the field. The earl fled abroad and continued his fight against the Yorkists, raiding shipping and eventually capturing the island fort of <a href="St%20Michael%27s%20Mount">St Michael's Mount</a> in 1473. He surrendered after receiving no aid or reinforcement, but in 1484 escaped from prison and joined Henry's court in France, bringing along his erstwhile gaoler <a href="James%20Blount">Sir James Blount</a>. Oxford's presence raised morale in Henry's camp and troubled Richard III.

In the early stages of the Wars of the Roses, the Stanleys of Cheshire had been predominantly Lancastrians. Sir <a href="William%20Stanley%20%28Battle%20of%20Bosworth%29">William Stanley</a>, however, was a staunch Yorkist supporter, fighting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blore%20Heath">Battle of Blore Heath</a> in 1459 and helping Hastings to put down uprisings against Edward IV in 1471. When Richard took the crown, Sir William showed no inclination to turn against the new king, refraining from joining Buckingham's rebellion, for which he was amply rewarded. Sir William's elder brother, <a href="Thomas%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley</a>, was not as steadfast. By 1485, he had served three kings, namely Henry VI, Edward IV, and Richard III. Lord Stanley's skilled political manoeuvrings—vacillating between opposing sides until it was clear who would be the winner—gained him high positions; he was Henry's chamberlain and Edward's steward. His non-committal stance, until the crucial point of a battle, earned him the loyalty of his men, who felt he would not needlessly send them to their deaths.

Even though Lord Stanley had served as Edward IV's steward, his relations with the king's brother, the eventual Richard III, were not cordial. The two had conflicts that erupted into violence around March 1470. Furthermore, having taken Lady Margaret as his second wife in June 1472, Stanley was Henry Tudor's stepfather, a relationship which did nothing to win him Richard's favour. Despite these differences, Stanley did not join <a href="Buckingham%27s%20revolt">Buckingham's revolt</a> in 1483. When Richard executed those conspirators who had been unable to flee England, he spared Lady Margaret. However, he declared her titles forfeit and transferred her estates to Stanley's name, to be held in trust for the Yorkist crown. Richard's act of mercy was calculated to reconcile him with Stanley, but it may have been to no avail—Carpenter has identified a further cause of friction in Richard's intention to reopen an old land dispute that involved Thomas Stanley and the Harrington family. Edward IV had ruled the case in favour of Stanley in 1473, but Richard planned to overturn his brother's ruling and give the wealthy estate to the Harringtons. Immediately before the Battle of Bosworth, being wary of Stanley, Richard took his son, <a href="George%20Stanley%2C%209th%20Baron%20Strange">Lord Strange</a>, as hostage to discourage him from joining Henry.

Reports of the number of soldiers Henry brought with him vary widely, with different sources giving figures of 1,000, 3,000, 3,600, 4,000 and 5,000 men. This initial force consisted of the English and Welsh exiles who had gathered around Henry, combined with a contingent of mercenaries put at his disposal by <a href="Charles%20VIII%20of%20France">Charles VIII of France</a>. The history of one "John Major" (published in 1521) claims that Charles had granted Henry 5,000 men, of whom 1,000 were Scots, headed by Sir Alexander Bruce. No mention of Scottish soldiers was made by subsequent English historians. After the battle, Bruce was given an annuity of £20 by Henry for his "faithful services". How many Frenchmen actually sailed is unknown, but the historian <a href="Chris%20Skidmore">Chris Skidmore</a> estimates over half of Henry's armed fleet. The <a href="Croyland%20Chronicle">Crowland Chronicler</a> also recorded that Henry's troops were "as much French as English". Many of these French mercenaries were from the garrison of <a href="Philippe%20de%20Cr%C3%A8vec%C5%93ur%20d%27Esquerdes">Philippe de Crevecoeur, Lord of Esquerdes</a>. <a href="Commynes">Commynes</a> recorded that these included "some 3,000 of the most unruly men in Normandy".

Henry's crossing of the English Channel in 1485 was without incident. Thirty ships sailed from <a href="Harfleur">Harfleur</a> on 1 August and, with fair winds behind them, landed in his native Wales, at Mill Bay (near <a href="Dale%2C%20Pembrokeshire">Dale</a>) on the north side of <a href="Milford%20Haven">Milford Haven</a> on 7 August, easily capturing nearby <a href="Dale%20Castle">Dale Castle</a>. His long-awaited arrival had been hailed by contemporary Welsh bards such as Dafydd Ddu and <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Dafydd">Gruffydd ap Dafydd</a> as the true prince and "the youth of Brittany defeating the Saxons" in order to bring their country back to glory. Mill Bay had been chosen as it was completely hidden from view and there was no resistance by the cohort of Richard's men stationed at Dale where Henry and his men spent the first night.

In the morning they marched to <a href="Haverfordwest">Haverfordwest</a>, the county town of <a href="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a>, 12 miles away and were received "with the utmost goodwill of all". Here, the Welshman Arnold Butler (who had met Henry in Brittany) announced that "the whole of Pembrokeshire was prepared to serve him". Butler's closest friend was <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Thomas">Rhys ap Thomas</a>. That afternoon, Henry and his troops headed north towards <a href="Cardigan%2C%20Ceredigion">Cardigan</a> and pitched camp "at the fifth milestone towards Cardigan" where they were joined by Gruffydd Rede with a band of soldiers and John Morgan of <a href="Tredegar">Tredegar</a>. The following day, 9 August, they passed through Bwlch-y-gwynt and over the <a href="Preseli%20Hills">Preseli mountains</a> and to Fagwyr Llwyd south of Cilgwyn.

Richard's lieutenant in South Wales, Sir Walter Herbert, failed to move against Henry, and two of his officers, Richard Griffith and Evan Morgan, deserted to Henry with their men.

However, the most important defector to Henry in this early stage of the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales. Richard had appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham's rebellion, asking that he surrender his son <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Rhys%20ap%20Thomas">Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas</a> as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales in exchange for his fealty. Henry marched via <a href="Aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</a> while Rhys followed a more southerly route, recruiting a force of Welshmen en route, variously estimated at 500 or 2,000 men, to swell Henry's army when they reunited at <a href="Long%20Mountain%20%28Powys%29">Cefn Digoll</a>, <a href="Welshpool">Welshpool</a>. By 15 or 16 August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>.

Since 22 June 1485 Richard had been aware of Henry's impending invasion, and had ordered his lords to maintain a high level of readiness. News of Henry's landing reached Richard on 11 August, but it took three to four days for his messengers to notify his lords of their king's mobilisation. On 16 August, the Yorkist army started to gather; Norfolk set off for <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, the assembly point, that night. The city of York, a traditional stronghold of Richard's family, asked the king for instructions, and receiving a reply three days later sent 80 men to join the king. Simultaneously Northumberland, whose northern territory was the most distant from the capital, had gathered his men and ridden to Leicester.

Although London was his goal, Henry did not move directly towards the city. After resting in Shrewsbury, his forces went eastwards and picked up <a href="Gilbert%20Talbot%20%28soldier%29">Sir Gilbert Talbot</a> and other English allies, including deserters from Richard's forces. Although its size had increased substantially since the landing, Henry's army was still substantially outnumbered by Richard's forces. Henry's pace through <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> was slow, delaying the confrontation with Richard so that he could gather more recruits to his cause. Henry had been communicating on friendly terms with the Stanleys for some time before setting foot in England, and the Stanleys had mobilised their forces on hearing of Henry's landing. They ranged themselves ahead of Henry's march through the English countryside, meeting twice in secret with Henry as he moved through Staffordshire. At the second of these, at <a href="Atherstone">Atherstone</a> in Warwickshire, they conferred "in what sort to arraign battle with King Richard, whom they heard to be not far off". On 21 August, the Stanleys were making camp on the slopes of a hill north of <a href="Dadlington">Dadlington</a>, while Henry encamped his army at White Moors to the northwest of their camp.
On 20 August, Richard rode from Nottingham to Leicester, joining Norfolk. He spent the night at the Blue Boar inn (demolished 1836). Northumberland arrived the following day. The royal army proceeded westwards to intercept Henry's march on London. Passing <a href="Sutton%20Cheney">Sutton Cheney</a>, Richard moved his army towards <a href="Ambion%20Hill">Ambion Hill</a>—which he thought would be of tactical value—and made camp on it. Richard's sleep was not peaceful and, according to the "<a href="Croyland%20Chronicle">Croyland Chronicle</a>", in the morning his face was "more livid and ghastly than usual".

The Yorkist army, variously estimated at between 7,500 and 12,000 men, deployed on the hilltop along the ridgeline from west to east. Norfolk's group (or "battle" in the parlance of the time) of spearmen stood on the right flank, protecting the cannon and about 1,200 archers. Richard's group, comprising 3,000 infantry, formed the centre. Northumberland's men guarded the left flank; he had approximately 4,000 men, many of them mounted. Standing on the hilltop, Richard had a wide, unobstructed view of the area. He could see the Stanleys and their 4,000–6,000 men holding positions on and around Dadlington Hill, while to the southwest was Henry's army.

Henry's force has been variously estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 men, his original landing force of exiles and mercenaries having been augmented by the recruits gathered in Wales and the English border counties (in the latter area probably mustered chiefly by the Talbot interest), and by deserters from Richard's army. Historian John Mackie believes that 1,800 French mercenaries, led by Philibert de Chandée, formed the core of Henry's army. <a href="John%20Major%20%28philosopher%29">John Mair</a>, writing thirty-five years after the battle, claimed that this force contained a significant Scottish component, and this claim is accepted by some modern writers, but Mackie reasons that the French would not have released their <a href="Garde%20Ecossaise">elite Scottish knights and archers</a>, and concludes that there were probably few Scottish troops in the army, although he accepts the presence of captains like <a href="Bernard%20Stewart%2C%20Lord%20of%20Aubigny">Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny</a>.

In their interpretations of the vague mentions of the battle in the old text, historians placed areas near the foot of Ambion Hill as likely regions where the two armies clashed, and thought up possible scenarios of the engagement. In their recreations of the battle, Henry started by moving his army towards Ambion Hill where Richard and his men stood. As Henry's army advanced past the marsh at the southwestern foot of the hill, Richard sent a message to Stanley, threatening to execute his son, <a href="George%20Stanley%2C%209th%20Baron%20Strange">Lord Strange</a>, if Stanley did not join the attack on Henry immediately. Stanley replied that he had other sons. Incensed, Richard gave the order to behead Strange but his officers temporised, saying that battle was imminent, and it would be more convenient to carry out the execution afterwards. Henry had also sent messengers to Stanley asking him to declare his allegiance. The reply was evasive—the Stanleys would "naturally" come, after Henry had given orders to his army and arranged them for battle. Henry had no choice but to confront Richard's forces alone.

Well aware of his own military inexperience, Henry handed command of his army to Oxford and retired to the rear with his bodyguards. Oxford, seeing the vast line of Richard's army strung along the ridgeline, decided to keep his men together instead of splitting them into the traditional three battles: vanguard, centre, and rearguard. He ordered the troops to stray no further than from their banners, fearing that they would become enveloped. Individual groups clumped together, forming a single large mass flanked by horsemen on the wings.

The Lancastrians were harassed by Richard's cannon as they manoeuvred around the marsh, seeking firmer ground. Once Oxford and his men were clear of the marsh, Norfolk's battle and several contingents of Richard's group, under the command of Sir <a href="Robert%20Brackenbury">Robert Brackenbury</a>, started to advance. Hails of arrows showered both sides as they closed. Oxford's men proved the steadier in the ensuing hand-to-hand combat; they held their ground and several of Norfolk's men fled the field. Norfolk lost one his senior officers, <a href="Walter%20Devereux%2C%207th%20Baron%20Ferrers%20of%20Chartley">Walter Devereux</a> in this early clash.

Recognising that his force was at a disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland's group showed no signs of movement. Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for personal reasons. Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland's loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill's narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle. The earl would have had to either go through his allies or execute a wide flanking move—near impossible to perform given the standard of drill at the time—to engage Oxford's men.

At this juncture Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided to end the fight quickly by <a href="single%20combat">killing the enemy commander</a>. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000 knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer <a href="William%20Brandon%20%28standard-bearer%29">Sir William Brandon</a> in the initial charge and unhorsed burly <a href="John%20Cheyne%2C%20Baron%20Cheyne">John Cheyne</a>, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with a blow to the head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.

Oxford had left a small reserve of <a href="Pike%20%28weapon%29">pike</a>-equipped men with Henry. They slowed the pace of Richard's mounted charge and bought Tudor some critical time. The remainder of Henry's bodyguards surrounded their master and succeeded in keeping him away from the Yorkist king. On seeing Richard embroiled with Henry's men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move. He led his men into the fight at Henry's side. Outnumbered, Richard's group was surrounded and gradually pressed back. Richard's force was driven several hundred yards away from Tudor, near to the edge of a marsh. The king's horse lost its footing and toppled into it. Richard gathered himself and rallied his dwindling followers, supposedly refusing to retreat: "God forbid that I retreat one step. I will either win the battle as a king, or die as one." In the fighting Richard's banner man—Sir <a href="Percival%20Thirlwall">Percival Thirlwall</a>—lost his legs but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was killed. It is likely that <a href="James%20Harrington%20%28Yorkist%20knight%29">James Harrington</a> also died in the charge. The king's trusted advisor <a href="Richard%20Ratcliffe">Richard Ratcliffe</a> was also slain.

<a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a>, Henry Tudor's official historian, recorded that "King Richard, alone, was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies". Richard had come within a sword's length of Henry Tudor before being surrounded by Sir William Stanley's men and killed. The Burgundian chronicler <a href="Jean%20Molinet">Jean Molinet</a> says that a Welshman struck the death-blow with a <a href="halberd">halberd</a> while Richard's horse was stuck in the marshy ground. It was said that the blows were so violent that the king's helmet was driven into his skull. The contemporary Welsh poet <a href="Guto%27r%20Glyn">Guto'r Glyn</a> implies the leading Welsh Lancastrian <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Thomas">Rhys ap Thomas</a>, or one of his men, killed the king, writing that he "killed the boar, shaved his head". The identification in 2013 of King Richard's body shows that the skeleton had 10 wounds, eight of them to the head, clearly inflicted in battle and suggesting he had lost his helmet. The skull showed that a blade had hacked away part of the rear of the skull.

Richard's forces disintegrated as news of his death spread. Northumberland and his men fled north on seeing the king's fate, and Norfolk was killed.

After the battle, Richard's <a href="circlet">circlet</a> is said to have been found and brought to Henry, who was proclaimed king at the top of Crown Hill, near the village of Stoke Golding. According to Vergil, Henry's official historian, Lord Stanley found the circlet. Historian Stanley Chrimes and Professor Sydney Anglo dismiss the legend of the circlet's finding in a <a href="Crataegus">hawthorn bush</a>; none of the contemporary sources reported such an event. Ross, however, does not ignore the legend. He argues that the hawthorn bush would not be part of Henry's coat of arms if it did not have a strong relationship to his ascendance. Baldwin points out that a hawthorn bush motif was already used by the House of Lancaster, and Henry merely added the crown.

In Vergil's chronicle, 100 of Henry's men, compared to 1,000 of Richard's, died in this battle—a ratio Chrimes believes to be an exaggeration. The bodies of the fallen were brought to St James Church at Dadlington for burial. However, Henry denied any immediate rest for Richard; instead the last Yorkist king's corpse was stripped naked and strapped across a horse. His body was brought to Leicester and openly exhibited to prove that he was dead. Early accounts suggest that this was in the major Lancastrian collegiate foundation, the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Annunciation%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Newarke">Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke</a>. After two days, the corpse was interred in a plain tomb, within the church of the <a href="Greyfriars%2C%20Leicester">Greyfriars</a>. The church was demolished following the friary's dissolution in 1538, and the location of Richard's tomb was long uncertain.

On 12 September 2012 archaeologists announced the <a href="Exhumation%20of%20Richard%20III%20of%20England">discovery of a battle-damaged skeleton</a> suspected to be Richard's in the remains of his burial church in Leicester. On 4 February 2013, it was announced that DNA testing had conclusively identified ("beyond reasonable doubt") the remains as those of Richard. On Thursday 26 March 2015, these remains were ceremonially buried in <a href="Leicester%20Cathedral">Leicester Cathedral</a>. On the following day the new royal tomb of Richard III was unveiled.

Henry dismissed the mercenaries in his force, retaining only a small core of local soldiers to form the "<a href="Yeomen%20of%20the%20Guard">Yeomen of his Garde</a>", and proceeded to establish his rule of England. Parliament reversed his attainder and recorded Richard's kingship as illegal, although the Yorkist king's reign remained officially in the annals of England history. The proclamation of Edward IV's children as illegitimate was also reversed, restoring Elizabeth's status to a royal princess. The marriage of Elizabeth, the heiress to the House of York, to Henry, the master of the House of Lancaster, marked the end of the feud between the two houses and the start of the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a>. The royal matrimony, however, was delayed until Henry was crowned king and had established his claim on the throne firmly enough to preclude that of Elizabeth and her kin. Henry further convinced Parliament to backdate his reign to the day before the battle, enabling him retrospectively to declare as traitors those who had fought against him at Bosworth Field. Northumberland, who had remained inactive during the battle, was imprisoned but later released and reinstated to pacify the north in Henry's name. The purge of those who fought for Richard occupied Henry's first two years of rule, although later he proved prepared to accept those who submitted to him regardless of their former allegiances.

Of his supporters, Henry rewarded the Stanleys the most generously. Aside from making William his chamberlain, he bestowed the earldom of Derby upon Lord Stanley along with grants and offices in other estates. Henry rewarded Oxford by restoring to him the lands and titles confiscated by the Yorkists and appointing him as <a href="Constable%20of%20the%20Tower">Constable of the Tower</a> and admiral of England, Ireland, and <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>. For his kin, Henry created Jasper Tudor the Duke of Bedford. He returned to his mother the lands and grants stripped from her by Richard, and proved to be a filial son, granting her a place of honour in the palace and faithfully attending to her throughout his reign. Parliament's declaration of Margaret as "<a href="femme%20sole">femme sole</a>" effectively empowered her; she no longer needed to manage her estates through Stanley. Elton points out that despite his initial largesse, Henry's supporters at Bosworth would only enjoy his special favour for the short term; in later years, he would instead promote those who best served his interests.

Like the kings before him, Henry faced dissenters. The first open revolt occurred two years after Bosworth Field; <a href="Lambert%20Simnel">Lambert Simnel</a> claimed to be <a href="Edward%20Plantagenet%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick</a>, who was Edward IV's nephew. The Earl of Lincoln backed him for the throne and led rebel forces in the name of the House of York. The rebel army fended off several attacks by Northumberland's forces, before engaging Henry's army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stoke%20Field">Battle of Stoke Field</a> on 16 June 1487. Oxford and Bedford led Henry's men, including several former supporters of Richard III. Henry won this battle easily, but other malcontents and conspiracies would follow. A rebellion in 1489 started with Northumberland's murder; military historian Michael C. C. Adams says that the author of a note, which was left next to Northumberland's body, blamed the earl for Richard's death.

Contemporary accounts of the Battle of Bosworth can be found in four main sources, one of which is the English "<a href="Croyland%20Chronicle">Croyland Chronicle</a>", written by a senior Yorkist chronicler who relied on second-hand information from nobles and soldiers. The other accounts were written by foreigners—Vergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera. Whereas Molinet was sympathetic to Richard, Vergil was in Henry's service and drew information from the king and his subjects to portray them in a good light. Diego de Valera, whose information Ross regards as unreliable, compiled his work from letters of Spanish merchants. However, other historians have used Valera's work to deduce possibly valuable insights not readily evident in other sources. Ross finds the poem, "The Ballad of Bosworth Field", a useful source to ascertain certain details of the battle. The multitude of different accounts, mostly based on second- or third-hand information, has proved an obstacle to historians as they try to reconstruct the battle. Their common complaint is that, except for its outcome, very few details of the battle are found in the chronicles. According to historian <a href="Michael%20Hicks%20%28historian%29">Michael Hicks</a>, the Battle of Bosworth is one of the worst-recorded clashes of the Wars of the Roses.

Henry tried to present his victory as a new beginning for the country; he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a "modern age" with its dawn in 1485. Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian <a href="Bernard%20Andr%C3%A9">Bernard André</a>, promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers for the next four hundred years. As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry's reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings. For England the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> ended in 1485, and <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> claims that other than <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>'s successful <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">invasion</a> of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history. By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome. According to <a href="Reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">Reader</a> Colin Burrow, André was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his "Henry VII" (1502). For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because "the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side."

Historians such as Adams and Horrox believe that Richard lost the battle not for any mythic reasons, but because of morale and loyalty problems in his army. Most of the common soldiers found it difficult to fight for a liege whom they distrusted, and some lords believed that their situation might improve if Richard was dethroned. According to Adams, against such duplicities Richard's desperate charge was the only knightly behaviour on the field. As fellow historian Michael Bennet puts it, the attack was "the swan-song of [mediaeval] English chivalry". Adams believes this view was shared at the time by the printer <a href="William%20Caxton">William Caxton</a>, who enjoyed sponsorship from Edward IV and Richard III. Nine days after the battle, Caxton published <a href="Thomas%20Malory">Thomas Malory</a>'s story about chivalry and death by betrayal—"<a href="Le%20Morte%20d%27Arthur">Le Morte d'Arthur</a>"—seemingly as a response to the circumstances of Richard's death.

Elton does not believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, pointing out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.

Mackie asserts that, in hindsight, Bosworth Field is notable as the decisive battle that established a dynasty which would rule unchallenged over England for more than a hundred years. Mackie notes that contemporary historians of that time, wary of the three royal successions during the long Wars of the Roses, considered Bosworth Field just another in a lengthy series of such battles. It was through the works and efforts of <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> and his successors that the public started to believe the battle had decided their futures by bringing about "the fall of a tyrant".

<a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> gives prominence to the Battle of Bosworth in his play, "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>". It is the "one big battle"; no other fighting scene distracts the audience from this action, represented by a one-on-one sword fight between Henry Tudor and Richard III. Shakespeare uses their duel to bring a climactic end to the play and the Wars of the Roses; he also uses it to champion morality, portraying the "unequivocal triumph of good over evil". Richard, the villainous lead character, has been built up in the battles of Shakespeare's earlier play, "<a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Part%203">Henry VI, Part 3</a>", as a "formidable swordsman and a courageous military leader"—in contrast to the dastardly means by which he becomes king in "Richard III". Although the Battle of Bosworth has only five sentences to direct it, three scenes and more than four hundred lines precede the action, developing the background and motivations for the characters in anticipation of the battle.
Shakespeare's account of the battle was mostly based on chroniclers <a href="Edward%20Hall">Edward Hall</a>'s and <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a>'s dramatic versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle. However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar <a href="Thomas%20More">Thomas More</a>, whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king. The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama. <a href="Margaret%20of%20Anjou">Margaret of Anjou</a> died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in "Henry VI". Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham. Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts that he will be evil, if such needed to retain his crown.

The fight between the two armies is simulated by rowdy noises made off-stage ("alarums" or alarms) while actors walk on-stage, deliver their lines, and exit. To build anticipation for the duel, Shakespeare requests more "alarums" after Richard's councillor, <a href="William%20Catesby">William Catesby</a>, announces that the king is "[enacting] more wonders than a man". Richard punctuates his entrance with the classic line, "A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!" He refuses to withdraw, continuing to seek to slay Henry's doubles until he has killed his nemesis. There is no documentary evidence that Henry had five <a href="Political%20decoy">decoys</a> at Bosworth Field; the idea was Shakespeare's invention. He drew inspiration from <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV</a>'s use of them at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shrewsbury">Battle of Shrewsbury</a> (1403) to amplify the perception of Richard's courage on the battlefield. Similarly, the single combat between Henry and Richard is Shakespeare's creation. "<a href="The%20True%20Tragedy%20of%20Richard%20III">The True Tragedy of Richard III</a>", by an unknown playwright, earlier than Shakespeare's, has no signs of staging such an encounter: its stage directions give no hint of visible combat.
Despite the dramatic licences taken, Shakespeare's version of the Battle of Bosworth was the model of the event for English textbooks for many years during the 18th and 19th centuries. This glamorised version of history, promulgated in books and paintings and played out on stages across the country, perturbed humorist <a href="Gilbert%20Abbott%20%C3%A0%20Beckett">Gilbert Abbott à Beckett</a>. He voiced his criticism in the form of a poem, equating the romantic view of the battle to watching a "fifth-rate production of "Richard III"": shabbily costumed actors fight the Battle of Bosworth on-stage while those with lesser roles lounge at the back, showing no interest in the proceedings.

In <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>'s <a href="Richard%20III%20%281955%20film%29">1955 film adaptation</a> of "Richard III", the Battle of Bosworth is represented not by a single duel but a general melee that became the film's most recognised scene and a regular screening at Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre. The film depicts the clash between the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies on an open field, focusing on individual characters amidst the savagery of hand-to-hand fighting, and received accolades for the realism portrayed. One reviewer for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" newspaper, however, was not impressed, finding the number of combatants too sparse for the wide plains and a lack of subtlety in Richard's death scene. The means by which Richard is shown to prepare his army for the battle also earned acclaim. As Richard speaks to his men and draws his plans in the sand using his sword, his units appear on-screen, arraying themselves according to the lines that Richard had drawn. Intimately woven together, the combination of pictorial and narrative elements effectively turns Richard into a storyteller, who acts out the plot he has constructed. Shakespearian critic Herbert Coursen extends that imagery: Richard sets himself up as a creator of men, but dies amongst the savagery of his creations. Coursen finds the depiction a contrast to that of <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a> and his "band of brothers".

The adaptation of the setting for "Richard III" to a 1930s fascist England in <a href="Ian%20McKellen">Ian McKellen</a>'s <a href="Richard%20III%20%281995%20film%29">1995 film</a>, however, did not sit well with historians. Adams posits that the original Shakespearian setting for Richard's fate at Bosworth teaches the moral of facing one's fate, no matter how unjust it is, "nobly and with dignity". By overshadowing the dramatic teaching with special effects, McKellen's film reduces its version of the battle to a pyrotechnic spectacle about the death of a one-dimensional villain. Coursen agrees that, in this version, the battle and Richard's end are trite and underwhelming.

Officially the site of the battle is deemed by <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Council">Leicestershire County Council</a> to be in the vicinity of the town of <a href="Market%20Bosworth">Market Bosworth</a>. The council engaged historian Daniel Williams to research the battle, and in 1974 his findings were used to build the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre and the presentation it houses. Williams's interpretation, however, has since been questioned. Sparked by the battle's quincentenary celebration in 1985, a dispute among historians has led many to suspect the accuracy of Williams's theory. In particular, geological surveys conducted from 2003 to 2009 by the Battlefields Trust, a charitable organisation that protects and studies old English battlefields, show that the southern and eastern flanks of Ambion Hill were solid ground in the 15th century, contrary to Williams's claim that it was a large area of marshland. <a href="Landscape%20archaeology">Landscape archaeologist</a> <a href="Glenn%20Foard">Glenn Foard</a>, leader of the survey, said the collected soil samples and finds of medieval military equipment suggest that the battle took place southwest of Ambion Hill (52°34′41″N 1°26′02″W), contrary to the popular belief that it was fought near the foot of the hill.

The <a href="Historic%20Buildings%20and%20Monuments%20Commission%20for%20England">Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England</a> (popularly referred to as "English Heritage") argues that the battle was named after Market Bosworth because the town was the nearest significant settlement to the battlefield in the 15th century. As explored by Professor Philip Morgan, a battle might initially not be named specifically at all. As time passes, writers of administrative and historical records find it necessary to identify a notable battle, ascribing it a name that is usually <a href="toponymy">toponymical</a> in nature and sourced from combatants or observers. This official name becomes accepted by society and future generations without question. Early records associated the Battle of Bosworth with "Brownehethe", ""bellum Miravallenses"", "Sandeford" and "Dadlyngton field". The earliest record, a municipal memorandum of 23 August 1485 from York, locates the battle "on the field of Redemore". This is corroborated by a 1485–86 letter that mentions "Redesmore" as its site. According to historian Peter Foss, records did not associate the battle with "Bosworth" until 1510.

Foss is named by English Heritage as the principal advocate for "Redemore" as the battle site. He suggests the name is derived from ""Hreod Mor"", an Anglo-Saxon phrase that means "reedy marshland". Basing his opinion on 13th- and 16th-century church records, he believes "Redemore" was an area of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the village of <a href="Dadlington">Dadlington</a>, and was close to the Fenn Lanes, a <a href="Roman%20roads">Roman road</a> running east to west across the region. Foard believes this road to be the most probable route that both armies took to reach the battlefield. Williams dismisses the notion of "Redmore" as a specific location, saying that the term refers to a large area of reddish soil; Foss argues that Williams's sources are local stories and flawed interpretations of records. Moreover, he proposes that Williams was influenced by <a href="William%20Hutton%20%28Birmingham%20historian%29">William Hutton</a>'s 1788 "The Battle of Bosworth-Field", which Foss blames for introducing the notion that the battle was fought west of Ambion Hill on the north side of the <a href="River%20Sence">River Sence</a>. Hutton, as Foss suggests, misinterpreted a passage from his source, <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a>'s 1577 "Chronicle". Holinshed wrote, "King Richard pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest." Foss believes that Hutton mistook "field" to mean "field of battle", thus creating the idea that the fight took place on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill. To "[pitch] his field", as Foss clarifies, was a period expression for setting up a camp.
Foss brings further evidence for his "Redemore" theory by quoting <a href="Edward%20Hall">Edward Hall</a>'s 1550 "Chronicle". Hall stated that Richard's army stepped onto a plain after breaking camp the next day. Furthermore, historian <a href="William%20Burton%20%28antiquary%29">William Burton</a>, author of "Description of Leicestershire" (1622), wrote that the battle was "fought in a large, flat, plaine, and spacious ground, three miles [5 km] distant from [Bosworth], between the Towne of <a href="Shenton">Shenton</a>, Sutton [Cheney], Dadlington and Stoke [Golding]". In Foss's opinion both sources are describing an area of flat ground north of Dadlington.

English Heritage, responsible for managing England's historic sites, used both theories to designate the site for Bosworth Field. Without preference for either theory, they constructed a single continuous battlefield boundary that encompasses the locations proposed by both Williams and Foss. The region has experienced extensive changes over the years, starting after the battle. Holinshed stated in his chronicle that he found firm ground where he expected the marsh to be, and Burton confirmed that by the end of the 16th century, areas of the battlefield were enclosed and had been <a href="Land%20improvement">improved</a> to make them agriculturally productive. Trees were planted on the south side of Ambion Hill, forming Ambion Wood. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the <a href="Ashby%20Canal">Ashby Canal</a> carved through the land west and south-west of Ambion Hill. Winding alongside the canal at a distance, the <a href="Ashby%20and%20Nuneaton%20Joint%20Railway">Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway</a> crossed the area on an embankment. The changes to the landscape were so extensive that when Hutton revisited the region in 1807 after an earlier 1788 visit, he could not readily find his way around.
Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on Ambion Hill, near Richard's Well. According to legend, Richard III drank from one of the several springs in the region on the day of the battle. In 1788, a local pointed out one of the springs to Hutton as the one mentioned in the legend. A stone structure was later built over the location. The inscription on the well reads:

Northwest of Ambion Hill, just across the northern tributary of the , a flag and memorial stone mark Richard's Field. Erected in 1973, the site was selected on the basis of Williams's theory. St James's Church at Dadlington is the only structure in the area that is reliably associated with the Battle of Bosworth; the bodies of those killed in the battle were buried there.

The very extensive survey carried out (2005–2009) by the Battlefields Trust headed by Glenn Foard led eventually to the discovery of the real location of the core battlefield. This lies about a kilometer further west than the location suggested by Peter Foss. It is in what was at the time of the battle an area of marginal land at the meeting of several township boundaries. There was a cluster of field names suggesting the presence of marshland and heath. Thirty four lead round shot were discovered as a result of systematic metal detecting (more than the total found previously on all other C15th European battlefields), as well as other significant finds, including a small silver gilt badge depicting a boar. Experts believe that the boar badge could indicate the actual site of Richard III's death, since this high-status badge depicting his personal emblem, was probably worn by a member of his close retinue.

A new interpretation of the battle now integrates the historic accounts with the battlefield finds and landscape history. The new site lies either side of the Fenn Lanes Roman road, close to Fenn Lane Farm and is some three kilometers to the southwest of Ambion Hill. 
Based on the round shot scatter, the likely size of Richard III's army, and the topography, Glenn Foard and Anne Curry think that Richard may have lined up his forces on a slight ridge which lies just east of Fox Covert Lane and behind a postulated medieval marsh. Richard's vanguard commanded by the Duke of Norfolk was on the right (north) side of Richard's battle line, with the Earl of Northumberland on Richard's left (south) side.

Tudor's forces approached along the line of the Roman road and lined up to the west of the present day Fenn Lane Farm, having marched from the vicinity of Merevale in Warwickshire. 
The Stanleys were positioned on the south side of the battlefield, on rising ground towards Stoke Golding and Dadlington. The Earl of Oxford turned north to avoid the marsh (and possibly Richard's guns). This manoeuvre put the marsh on Oxford's right. He moved to attack Norfolk's vanguard. Norfolk was subsequently killed.

Northumberland failed to engage, possibly due to the presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what came to be known as Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.

The windmill close to which the Duke of Norfolk is said to have died (according to the ballad "Lady Bessy") was Dadlington windmill. This has disappeared but is known to have stood at the time of the battle, in the vicinity of Apple Orchard Farm and North Farm, Dadlington. A small cluster of significant finds was made in this area, including a gold livery badge depicting an eagle. The windmill lay between the core battlefield and Richard's camp on Ambion Hill and the rout of Norfolk's vanguard was in this direction. This also accounts for the large number of dead in Dadlington parish, leading to the setting up of the battle chantry there.

Historic England have re-defined the boundaries of the registered Bosworth Battlefield to incorporate the newly identified site. There are hopes that public access to the site may be possible in the future.

Brassicaceae

Brassicaceae or Cruciferae is a medium-sized and economically important <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of <a href="flowering%20plants">flowering plants</a> commonly known as the mustards, the crucifers, or the cabbage family. Most are <a href="herbaceous%20plants">herbaceous plants</a>, some shrubs, with simple, although sometimes deeply incised, alternatingly set leaves without <a href="stipule">stipule</a>s or in leaf rosettes, with terminal inflorescences without bracts, containing flowers with four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two short and four longer free stamens, and a fruit with seeds in rows, divided by a thin wall (or septum).

The family contains 372 <a href="genus">genera</a> and 4060 accepted <a href="species">species</a>. The largest genera are "<a href="Draba">Draba</a>" (440 species), "<a href="Erysimum">Erysimum</a>" (261 species), "<a href="Lepidium">Lepidium</a>" (234 species), "<a href="Cardamine">Cardamine</a>" (233 species), and "<a href="Alyssum">Alyssum</a>" (207 species).

The family contains the <a href="cruciferous%20vegetables">cruciferous vegetables</a>, including species such as "<a href="Brassica%20oleracea">Brassica oleracea</a>" (e.g., broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards), "<a href="Brassica%20rapa">Brassica rapa</a>" (turnip, Chinese cabbage, etc.), "<a href="Brassica%20napus">Brassica napus</a>" (rapeseed, etc.), "<a href="Raphanus%20sativus">Raphanus sativus</a>" (common radish), "<a href="Armoracia%20rusticana">Armoracia rusticana</a>" (horseradish), "<a href="Matthiola">Matthiola</a>" (stock) and the <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a> "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" (thale cress).

"<a href="Pieris%20rapae">Pieris rapae</a>" and other butterflies of the family <a href="Pieridae">Pieridae</a> are some of the best-known pests of Brassicaceae species planted as commercial crops.

<a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1753 regarded the Brassicaceae as a natural group naming them "Klass" Tetradynamia. <a href="Alfred%20Barton%20Rendle">Alfred Barton Rendle</a> placed the family in the order <a href="Bessey%20system%23Oppositifoliae">Rhoedales</a>, while <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Dalton Hooker</a> in their system published from 1862–1883, assigned it to their cohort Parietales (now the class <a href="Violales">Violales</a>). Following Bentham and Hooker, <a href="John%20Hutchinson%20%28botanist%29">John Hutchinson</a> in 1948 and again in 1964 thought the Brassicaceae to stem from near the Papaveraceae. In 1994, a group of scientists including <a href="Walter%20Stephen%20Judd">Walter Stephen Judd</a> suggested to include the <a href="Capparaceae">Capparaceae</a> in the Brassicaceae. Early DNA-analysis showed that the Capparaceae - as defined at that moment - were <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a>, and it was suggested to assign the genera closest to the Brassicaceae to the <a href="Cleomaceae">Cleomaceae</a>. The Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae diverged approximately 41 million years ago. All three families have consistently been placed in one order (variably called Capparales or <a href="Brassicales">Brassicales</a>). The <a href="APG%20II">APG II</a> system, merged Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae. Other classifications have continued to recognize the Capparaceae, but with a more restricted circumscription, either including "Cleome" and its relatives in the Brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family <a href="Cleomaceae">Cleomaceae</a>. The <a href="APG%20III%20system">APG III system</a> has recently adopted this last solution, but this may change as a consensus arises on this point. Current insights in the relationships of the Brassicaceae, based on a 2012 DNA-analysis, are summarized in the following tree.
Early classifications depended on morphological comparison only, but because of extensive <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>, these do not provide a reliable <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a>. Although a substantial effort was made through <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetic studies</a>, the relationships within the Brassicaceae have not always been well resolved yet. It has long been clear that the Aethionemae are <a href="Sister%20group">sister</a> of the remainder of the family. One analysis from 2014 represented the relation between 39 tribes with the following tree.
The name "Brassicaceae" () comes to <a href="international%20scientific%20vocabulary">international scientific vocabulary</a> from <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a>, from "<a href="Brassica">Brassica</a>", the <a href="type%20genus">type genus</a>, + "<a href="wikt%3A-aceae%23Suffix">-aceae</a>", a standardized <a href="suffix">suffix</a> for plant family names in modern taxonomy. The genus name comes from the <a href="Classical%20Latin">Classical Latin</a> word "<a href="wikt%3Abrassica%23Noun%202">brassica</a>", referring to <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a> and other <a href="cruciferous%20vegetables">cruciferous vegetables</a>. The alternative older name, <a href="wikt%3ACruciferae">Cruciferae</a> (), meaning "cross-bearing", describes the four <a href="petal">petal</a>s of mustard flowers, which resemble a <a href="cross">cross</a>. Cruciferae is one of eight plant family names, not derived from a genus name and without the suffix "-aceae" that are authorized alternative names.

Species belonging to the Brassicaceae are mostly <a href="Annual%20plant">annual</a>, <a href="Biennial%20plant">biennial</a>, or <a href="Perennial%20plant">perennial</a> <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous plant</a>s, some are <a href="dwarf%20shrub">dwarf shrub</a>s or <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s, and very few <a href="vine">vine</a>s. Although generally terrestrial, a few species such as <a href="water%20awlwort">water awlwort</a> live submerged in fresh water. They may have a <a href="taproot">taproot</a> or a sometimes woody <a href="caudex">caudex</a> that may have few or many branches, some have thin or tuberous <a href="rhizome">rhizome</a>s, or rarely develop <a href="Stolon">runners</a>. Few species have multi-cellular glands. <a href="Trichome">Hairs</a> consist of one cell and occur in many forms: from simple to forked, star-, tree- or T-shaped, rarely taking the form of a shield or scale. They are never topped by a gland. The <a href="Plant%20stem">stem</a>s may be upright, rise up towards the tip, or lie flat, are mostly herbaceous but sometimes woody. Stems carry leaves or the stems may be leafless (in "<a href="Caulanthus">Caulanthus</a>"), and some species lack stems altogether. The leaves do not have <a href="stipule">stipule</a>s, but there may be a pair of glands at base of <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">leafstalks</a> and <a href="Pedicel%20%28botany%29">flowerstalks</a>. The leaf may be seated or have a leafstalk. The <a href="Leaf%23Morphology%20%28large-scale%20features%29">leaf blade</a> is usually simple, entire or <a href="Leaf%23Divisions%20of%20the%20blade">dissected</a>, rarely <a href="Leaf%23Divisions%20of%20the%20blade">trifoliolate</a> or <a href="Leaf%23Divisions%20of%20the%20blade">pinnately compound</a>. A leaf rosette at the base may be present or absent. The leaves along the stem are almost always <a href="Leaf%23Arrangement%20on%20the%20stem">alternately arranged</a>, rarely apparently opposite. The <a href="genome%20size">genome size</a> of Brassicaceae compared to that of other Angiosperm families is very small to small (less than 3.425 million base pairs per cell), varying from 150 Mbp in "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" and "<a href="Sphaerocardamum">Sphaerocardamum</a>" spp., to 2375 Mbp "<a href="Bunias%20orientalis">Bunias orientalis</a>". The number of <a href="homologous%20chromosomes">homologous chromosome sets</a> varies from four (n=4) in some "<a href="Physaria">Physaria</a>" and "<a href="Stenopetalum">Stenopetalum</a>" species, five (n=5) in other "Physaria" and "Stenopetalum" species, "Arabidopsis thaliana" and a "<a href="Mathiola">Mathiola</a>" species, to seventeen (n=17). About 35% of the species in which chromosomes have been counted have eight sets (n=8). Due to <a href="polyploidy">polyploidy</a>, some species may have up to 256 individual chromosomes, with some very high counts in the North-American species of "Cardamine", such as "<a href="Cardamine%20diphylla">C. diphylla</a>". <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">Hybridisation</a> is not unusual in Brassicaceae, especially in "<a href="Arabis">Arabis</a>", "<a href="Rorippa">Rorippa</a>", "<a href="Cardamine">Cardamine</a>" and "<a href="Boechera">Boechera</a>". Hybridisation between species originating in Africa and California, and subsequent <a href="Speciation%23Speciation%20via%20polyploidization">polyploidisation</a> is surmised for "<a href="Lepidium">Lepidium</a>" species native to Australia and New Zealand.

Flowers may be arranged in <a href="raceme">raceme</a>s, <a href="panicle">panicle</a>s, or <a href="corymb">corymb</a>s, with pedicels sometimes in the axil of a bract, and few species have flowers that sit individually on flower stems that spring from the axils of rosette leaves. The orientation of the pedicels when fruits are ripe varies dependend on the species. The flowers are <a href="Plant%20reproductive%20morphology%23Terminology">bisexual</a>, <a href="Floral%20symmetry%23Actinomorphic">star symmetrical</a> (zygomorphic in "<a href="Iberis">Iberis</a>" and "<a href="Teesdalia">Teesdalia</a>") and the <a href="Ovary%20%28botany%29%23Superior%20ovary">ovary positioned above the other floral parts</a>. Each flower has four free or seldomly merged <a href="sepal">sepal</a>s, the lateral two sometimes with a shallow spur, which are mostly shed after flowering, rarely persistent, may be reflexed, spreading, ascending, or erect, together forming a tube-, bell- or urn-shaped calyx. Each flower has four <a href="petal">petal</a>s, set alternating with the sepals, although in some species these are rudimentary or absent. They may be differentiated into a <a href="Petal%23Shape%20and%20size">blade</a> and a <a href="Petal%23Shape%20and%20size">claw</a> or not, and consistently lack basal appendages. The blade is entire or has an indent at the tip, and may sometimes be much smaller than the claws. The mostly six <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s are set in two whorls: usually the two lateral, outer ones are shorter than the four inner stamens, but very rarely the stamens can all have the same length, and very rarely species have different numbers of stamens such as sixteen to twenty four in "<a href="Megacarpaea">Megacarpaea</a>", four in "<a href="Cardamine%20hirsuta">Cardamine hirsuta</a>", and two in "<a href="Coronopus">Coronopus</a>". The filaments are slender and not fused, while the anthers consist of two pollen producing cavities, and open with longitudinal slits. The pollen grains are <a href="tricolpate">tricolpate</a>. The <a href="Receptacle%20%28botany%29">receptacle</a> carries a variable number of <a href="nectar">nectar</a>ies, but these are always present opposite the base of the lateral stamens.

There is one <a href="Gynoecium%23Gynoecium%20position">superior</a> <a href="Gynoecium%23Pistils">pistil</a> that consists of two <a href="carpel">carpel</a>s that may either sit directly above the base of the stamens or on a <a href="Gynophore">stalk</a>. It initially consists of only one cavity but during its further development a thin wall grows that divides the cavity, both placentas and separates the two valves (a so-called false septum). Rarely, there is only one cavity without a septum. The 2–600 <a href="ovule">ovule</a>s are usually along the side margin of the carpels, or rarely at the top. Fruits are capsules that open with two valves, usually towards the top. These are called <a href="silique">silique</a> if at least three times longer than wide, or silicle if the length is less than three times the width. The fruit is very variable in its other traits. There may be one persistent <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29%23Style">style</a> that connects the ovary to the globular or conical <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a>, which is undivided or has two spreading or connivent lobes. The variously shaped seeds are usually yellow or brown in color, and arranged in one or two rows in each cavety. The <a href="Cotyledon">seed leaves</a> are entire or have a notch at the tip. The seed does not contain <a href="endosperm">endosperm</a>.

Brassicaceae have a bisymmetical corolla (left is mirrored by right, stem-side by out-side, but each quarter is not symmetrical), a septum dividing the fruit, lack <a href="stipule">stipule</a>s and have simple (although sometimes deeply incised) leaves. The <a href="sister%20group">sister family</a> <a href="Cleomaceae">Cleomaceae</a> has <a href="Floral%20symmetry%23Zygomorphic">bilateral symmetrical</a> corollas (left is mirrored by right, but stem-side is different from out-side), stipules and mostly palmately divided leaves, but no septum. Capparaceae generally have a <a href="gynophore">gynophore</a>, sometimes an <a href="androgynophore">androgynophore</a>, and a variable number of stamens.

Almost all Brassicaceae have <a href="C3%20carbon%20fixation">C3 carbon fixation</a>. The only exceptions are a few "<a href="Moricandia">Moricandia</a>" species, which have a hybrid system between C3 and <a href="C4%20carbon%20fixation">C4 carbon fixation</a>, C4 fixation being more efficient in drought, high temperature and low nitrate availability. Brassicaceae contain different cocktails of dozens of <a href="glucosinolate">glucosinolate</a>s. They also contain enzymes called <a href="myrosinase">myrosinase</a>s, that convert the glucosinolates into <a href="isothiocyanate">isothiocyanate</a>s, <a href="thiocyanate">thiocyanate</a>s and <a href="nitrile">nitrile</a>s, which are toxic to many organisms, and so help guard against herbivory.

Brassicaceae can be found almost on the entire land surface of the planet, but it is absent from Antarctica, and in some areas in the tropics i.e. north-eastern Brazil, the <a href="Congo%20basin">Congo basin</a>, <a href="Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">Maritime Southeast Asia</a> and tropical <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>. The area of origin of the family is possibly the <a href="Irano-Turanian%20Region">Irano-Turanian Region</a>, where approximately 900 species occur in 150 different genera. About 530 of them are <a href="Endemism">endemics</a>. Next in abundance comes the <a href="Mediterranean%20Region">Mediterranean Region</a> with around 630 species (290 of which are endemic) in 113 genera. The family is less prominent in the <a href="Saharo-Arabian%20Region">Saharo-Arabian Region</a> - 65 genera, 180 species of which 62 endemic - and North-America (comprising the <a href="North%20American%20Atlantic%20Region">North American Atlantic Region</a> and the <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20Floristic%20Region">Rocky Mountain Floristic Region</a>) - 99 genera, 780 species of which 600 endemic -. South-America has 40 genera containing 340 native species, Southern Africa 15 genera with over 100 species, and Australia and New-Zealand have 19 genera with 114 species between them.

Brassicaceae are almost exclusively <a href="Entomophily">pollinated by insects</a>. A chemical mechanism in the pollen is active in many species to avoid <a href="selfing">selfing</a>. Two notable exceptions are exclusive <a href="Cleistogamy">self pollination in closed flowers</a> in "<a href="Cardamine%20chenopodifolia">Cardamine chenopodifolia</a>", and wind pollination in "<a href="Pringlea">Pringlea antiscorbutica</a>". Most species reproduce sexually through seed, but "<a href="Cardamine%20bulbifera">Cardamine bulbifera</a>" produces <a href="Gemma%20%28botany%29">gemmae</a> and in others, such as "<a href="Cardamine%20pentaphyllos">Cardamine pentaphyllos</a>", the coral-like roots easily break into segments, that will grow into separate plants. Some species, such as in the genus "<a href="Cardamine">Cardamine</a>", open with force and so catapult the seeds quite far. Many of these have sticky seed coats, assisting long distance dispersal by animals, and this may also explain several intercontinental dispersal events in the genus, and its near global distribution. Brassicaceae are common on <a href="serpentine%20soil">serpentine</a> and <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a> rich in <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>. Over a hundred species in the family accumulate <a href="heavy%20metals">heavy metals</a>, particularly <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, which is a record percentage. Several "Alyssum" species can accumulate nickel up to 0.3% of their dry weight, and may be useful in soil remediation or even bio-mining.

Brassicaceae contain <a href="glucosinolate">glucosinolate</a>s as well as <a href="myrosinase">myrosinase</a>s inside their cells. When the cell is damaged, the myrosinases <a href="Hydrolysis">hydrolise</a> the glucosinolates, leading to the synthesis of <a href="isothiocyanate">isothiocyanate</a>s, which are compounds toxic to most animals, fungi and bacteria. Some insect herbivores have developed counter adaptations such as rapid absorption of the glucosinates, quick alternative breakdown into non-toxic compounds and avoiding cell damage. In the whites family (Pieridae), one counter mechanisme involves glucosinolate sulphatase, which changes the glucosinolate, so that it cannot be converted to isothiocyanate. A second is that the glucosinates are quickly broken down, forming nitriles. Differences between the mixtures of glucosinolates between species and even within species is large, and individual plants may produce in excess of fifty individual substances. The energy penalty for synthesising all these glucosinolates may be as high as 15% of the total needed to produce a leaf. "<a href="Bittercress">Bittercress</a>" ("Barbarea vulgaris") also produces <a href="triterpenoid%20saponin">triterpenoid saponin</a>s. These adaptations and counter adaptations probably have led to extensive diversification in both the Brassicaceae and one of its major pests, the butterfly family <a href="Pieridae">Pieridae</a>. A particular cocktail of volatile glucosinates triggers egg-laying in many species. Thus a particular crop can sometimes be protected by planting bittercress as a deadly bait, for the saponins kill the caterpillars, but the butterfly is still lured by the bittercress to lay its egg on the leaves.
A moth that feeds on a range of Brassicaceae is the <a href="diamondback%20moth">diamondback moth</a> ("Plutella xylostella"). Like the Pieridae, it is capable of converting isothiocyanates into less problematic <a href="nitrile">nitrile</a>s. Managing this pest in crops became more complicated after resistance developed against a toxin produced by "<a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis">Bacillus thuringiensis</a>", which is used as a wide spectrum biological <a href="plant%20protection">plant protection</a> against caterpillars. <a href="Parasitoid">Parasitoid</a> wasps that feed on such insect herbivores are attracted to the chemical compounds released by the plants, and thus are able to locate their prey. The <a href="cabbage%20aphid">cabbage aphid</a> ("Brevicoryne brassicae") stores glucosinolates and synthesises its own myrosinases, which may deter its potential predators.

This family includes important agricultural crops, among which many vegetables such as <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a>, <a href="broccoli">broccoli</a>, <a href="cauliflower">cauliflower</a>, <a href="kale">kale</a>, <a href="Brussels%20sprouts">Brussels sprouts</a>, <a href="collard%20greens">collard greens</a>, <a href="savoy">savoy</a>, <a href="kohlrabi">kohlrabi</a>, and <a href="gai%20lan">gai lan</a> ("Brassica oleracea"), <a href="turnip">turnip</a>, <a href="napa%20cabbage">napa cabbage</a>, <a href="bomdong">bomdong</a>, <a href="bok%20choy">bok choy</a> and <a href="cime%20di%20rapa">cime di rapa</a> ("Brassica rapa"), <a href="rocket%20salad">rocket salad</a> ("Eruca sativa"), <a href="garden%20cress">garden cress</a> ("Lepidium sativum"), <a href="watercress">watercress</a> ("Nasturtium officinale") and <a href="radish">radish</a> ("Raphanus") and a few spices like <a href="horseradish">horseradish</a> ("Armoracia rusticana"), "Brassica", <a href="wasabi">wasabi</a> ("Eutrema japonicum"), white, indian and black <a href="mustard%20plant">mustard</a> ("Sinapis alba", "Brassica juncea" and "B. nigra" respectively). Vegetable oils is produced from the seeds of several species such as "<a href="Brassica%20napus">Brassica napus</a>" (rapeseed oil), perhaps providing the largest volume of vegetable oils of any species. The small Eurasian weed "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" is widely used as model organism in molecular biology. The Brassicaceae also includes ornamentals, such as species of "Aethionema", "Alyssum", "Arabis", "Aubrieta", "Aurinia", "Erysimum", "Hesperis", "Iberis", "Lobularia", "Lunaria", "Malcolmia", and "Matthiola". <a href="Honesty%20%28plant%29">Honesty</a> ("Lunaria annua") is cultivated for the decorative value of the translucent remains of the fruits after drying. <a href="Woad">Woad</a> ("Isatis tinctoria") was used in the past to produce a blue textile dye (<a href="indigo">indigo</a>), but has largely been replaced by the same substance from unrelated tropical species like "<a href="Indigofera%20tinctoria">Indigofera tinctoria</a>". "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" is a very important <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a> in the study of the flowering plants (<a href="Angiospermae">Angiospermae</a>).

Books of the Bible

Different religious groups include different books in their <a href="Biblical%20canon">Biblical canon</a>s, in varying orders, and sometimes divide or combine books. Christian Bibles range from the 66 books of the <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> canon to the 81 books of the <a href="Ethiopian%20Orthodox%20Tewahedo%20Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> canon.

The <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> (sometimes called the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>) contains 24 books divided into three parts: the five books of the "<a href="Torah">Torah</a>" ("teaching"); the "<a href="Nevi%27im">Nevi'im</a>" ("prophets"); and the "<a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a>" ("writings"). The first part of <a href="Christian%20Bible">Christian Bible</a>s is called the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, which contains, at minimum, the above 24 books but divided into 39 books and ordered differently.

The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">Eastern Christian</a> churches also hold that certain <a href="deuterocanonical%20books">deuterocanonical books and passages</a> are part of the <a href="development%20of%20the%20Old%20Testament%20canon">Old Testament canon</a>. The second part is the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, containing 27 books; the four <a href="Canonical%20gospels">Canonical gospels</a>, <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, 21 <a href="Epistle%23New%20Testament%20epistles">Epistles</a> or letters and the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>.

The <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="Oriental%20Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a>, and <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Christian</a> churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books. The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive: if at least one Eastern church accepts the book it is included here.

<a href="Rabbinic%20Judaism">Rabbinic Judaism</a> recognizes the 24 books of the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a>, commonly called the "Tanakh" or <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, as authoritative. There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed: some scholars argue that it was fixed by the <a href="Hasmonean">Hasmonean</a> dynasty (140-40 BCE), while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later. Most conservative scholars believe that the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> was canonized c. 400 BCE, the <a href="Neviim">Prophets</a> c. 200 BCE, and the <a href="Ketuvim">Writings</a> c. 100 CE, perhaps at a <a href="Council%20of%20Jamnia">Council of Jamnia</a> as concluded by <a href="Heinrich%20Graetz">Heinrich Graetz</a> in 1871. The Council of Jamnia theory is increasingly rejected by most liberal scholars.

Protestants and Catholics use the Masoretic Text as the textual basis for their translations of the <a href="protocanonical%20books">protocanonical books</a> (those accepted as canonical by both Jews and all Christians), with various changes derived from a multiplicity of other ancient sources (such as the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, etc.), while generally using the Septuagint and Vulgate, now supplemented by the ancient Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts, as the textual basis for the <a href="deuterocanonical%20books">deuterocanonical books</a>.

The Eastern Orthodox use the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> (translated in the 3rd century BCE) as the textual basis for the entire Old Testament in both protocanonical and deuteroncanonical books—to use both in the Greek for <a href="liturgical">liturgical</a> purposes, and as the basis for translations into the <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a>. Most of the quotations (300 of 400) of the Old Testament in the New Testament, while differing more or less from the version presented by the Masoretic text, align with that of the Septuagint.

These books, which were largely written during the <a href="intertestamental%20period">intertestamental period</a>, are called the <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a> ("hidden things") by Protestants, the <a href="deuterocanon">deuterocanon</a> ("second canon") by Catholics, and the deuterocanon or "<a href="anagignoskomena">anagignoskomena</a>" ("worthy of reading") by Orthodox. These are works recognized by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches as being part of scripture (and thus deuterocanonical rather than apocryphal), but Protestants do not recognize them as <a href="Biblical%20inspiration">divinely inspired</a>. Orthodox differentiate scriptural books by omitting these (and others) from corporate worship and from use as a sole basis for doctrine.

Many recognize them as good, but not on the level of the other books of the Bible. <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a> considers the apocrypha worthy of being "read for example of life" but not to be used "to establish any doctrine." <a href="Luther%27s%20canon">Luther</a> made a parallel statement in calling them: "not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but...useful and good to read."

The difference in canons derives from the difference in the Masoretic Text and the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>. Books found in both the Hebrew and the Greek are accepted by all denominations, and by Jews, these are the protocanonical books. Catholics and Orthodox also accept those books present in manuscripts of the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament with great currency among the Jews of the ancient world, with the coda that Catholics consider <a href="3%20Esdras">3 Esdras</a> and <a href="3%20Maccabees">3 Maccabees</a> apocryphal.

Most quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament, differing by varying degrees from the Masoretic Text, are taken from the Septuagint. Daniel was written several hundred years after the time of Ezra, and since that time several books of the Septuagint have been found in the original Hebrew, in the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, the <a href="Cairo%20Geniza">Cairo Geniza</a>, and at <a href="Masada">Masada</a>, including a Hebrew text of Sirach (Qumran, Masada) and an Aramaic text of Tobit (Qumran); the additions to Esther and Daniel are also in their respective Semitic languages.

The unanimous consensus of modern (and ancient) scholars consider several other books, including 1 Maccabees and Judith, to have been composed in Hebrew or Aramaic. Opinion is divided on the book of Baruch, while it is acknowledged that the Epistle of Jeremiah, the Wisdom of Solomon, and 2 Maccabees are originally Greek compositions.


Additional books accepted by the Eastern Orthodox:

It accepts the 39 protocanonical books along with the following books, called the "<a href="Bible%20translations%20into%20Amharic%23New%20Haile%20Selassie%20I%20Bible%20%281962%29">narrow canon</a>".

The spelling and names in both the 1609–1610 <a href="Douay-Rheims%20Bible">Douay</a> Old Testament (and in the 1582 Rheims New Testament) and the 1749 revision by <a href="Bishop%20Challoner">Bishop Challoner</a> (the edition currently in print used by many Catholics, and the source of traditional Catholic spellings in English) and in the Septuagint differ from those spellings and names used in modern editions that derive from the Hebrew Masoretic text.

For the Orthodox canon, Septuagint titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. For the Catholic canon, the Douaic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. Likewise, the King James Version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the New Testament, such as "Esaias" (for Isaiah).

In the spirit of <a href="ecumenism">ecumenism</a> more recent Catholic translations (e.g., the <a href="New%20American%20Bible">New American Bible</a>, <a href="Jerusalem%20Bible">Jerusalem Bible</a>, and ecumenical translations used by Catholics, such as the <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version%20Catholic%20Edition">Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition</a>) use the same "standardized" (King James Version) spellings and names as Protestant Bibles (e.g., 1 Chronicles, as opposed to the Douaic 1 Paralipomenon, 1-2 Samuel and 1-2 Kings, instead of 1-4 Kings) in those books universally considered canonical—the <a href="Protocanonical%20books">protocanonicals</a>.

The <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> in <a href="Bava%20Batra">Bava Batra</a> 14b gives a different order for the books in "Nevi'im" and "Ketuvim". This order is also quoted in <a href="Mishneh%20Torah">Mishneh Torah</a> Hilchot <a href="Sefer%20%28Hebrew%29">Sefer</a> <a href="Torah">Torah</a> 7:15. The order of the books of the Torah are universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity.

The disputed books, included in one canon but not in others, are often called the <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a>, a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> Bibles. Catholics, following the <a href="Canon%20of%20Trent">Canon of Trent</a> (1546), describe these books as deuterocanonical, while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the <a href="Synod%20of%20Jerusalem%20%281672%29">Synod of Jerusalem (1672)</a>, use the traditional name of "<a href="anagignoskomena">anagignoskomena</a>", meaning "that which is to be read." They are present in a few historic Protestant versions; the German <a href="Luther%20Bible">Luther Bible</a> included such books, as did the English <a href="Authorized%20King%20James%20Version">1611 King James Version</a>.

Empty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon.
Several of the books in the Eastern Orthodox canon are also found in the appendix to the Latin Vulgate, formerly the official Bible of the Roman Catholic Church.

In general, among <a href="Christian%20denominations">Christian denominations</a>, the New Testament canon is an agreed-upon list of 27 books.

Baseball statistics

Baseball statistics play an important role in evaluating a player's and/or team's progress.

Since the flow of a baseball game has natural breaks to it, and normally players act individually rather than performing in clusters, the sport lends itself to easy record-keeping and <a href="statistics">statistics</a>. Statistics have been kept for <a href="professional%20baseball">professional baseball</a> since the creation of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> and <a href="American%20League">American League</a>, now part of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>.

Many statistics are also available from outside of Major League Baseball, from <a href="sports%20league">leagues</a> such as the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</a> and the <a href="Negro%20League">Negro League</a>s, although the consistency of whether these records were kept, of the standards with respect to which they were calculated, and of their accuracy varied.

The practice of keeping <a href="document">records</a> of player achievements was started in the 19th century by <a href="Henry%20Chadwick%20%28writer%29">Henry Chadwick</a>. Based on his experience with the sport of <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, Chadwick devised the predecessors to modern-day <a href="statistics">statistics</a> including <a href="Batting%20average%20%28baseball%29">batting average</a>, <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a> scored, and <a href="Earned%20run">runs allowed</a>.

Traditionally, statistics such as batting average (the number of hits divided by the number of at bats) and earned run average (the average number of earned runs allowed by a pitcher per nine innings) have dominated attention in the statistical world of baseball. However, the recent advent of <a href="sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a> has created statistics drawing from a greater breadth of player performance measures and playing field variables. Sabermetrics and comparative statistics attempt to provide an improved measure of a player's performance and contributions to his team from year to year, frequently against a statistical performance average.

Comprehensive, historical baseball statistics were difficult for the average fan to access until 1951, when researcher <a href="Hy%20Turkin">Hy Turkin</a> published "The Complete Encyclopedia of Baseball". In 1969, <a href="Macmillan%20Publishing">Macmillan Publishing</a> printed its first "<a href="Baseball%20Encyclopedia">Baseball Encyclopedia</a>", using a <a href="computer">computer</a> to compile statistics for the first time. Known as "Big Mac", the encyclopedia became the standard baseball reference until 1988, when "<a href="Total%20Baseball">Total Baseball</a>" was released by Warner Books using more sophisticated technology. The publication of "Total Baseball" led to the discovery of several "phantom ballplayers", such as <a href="Lou%20Proctor">Lou Proctor</a>, who did not belong in official record books and were removed.

Throughout modern baseball, a few core statistics have been traditionally referenced – <a href="Batting%20average%20%28baseball%29">batting average</a>, <a href="Runs%20batted%20in">RBI</a>, and <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s. To this day, a player who leads the league in all of these three statistics earns the "<a href="Triple%20crown%20%28baseball%29">Triple Crown</a>." For pitchers, <a href="Win%20%28baseball%29">wins</a>, <a href="Earned%20run%20average">ERA</a>, and <a href="strikeouts">strikeouts</a> are the most often-cited statistics, and a pitcher leading his league in these statistics may also be referred to as a "Triple Crown" winner. General managers and <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">baseball scouts</a> have long used the major statistics, among other factors and opinions, to understand player value. Managers, catchers and pitchers use the statistics of batters of opposing teams to develop pitching strategies and set <a href="baseball%20positioning">defensive positioning</a> on the field. Managers and batters study opposing pitcher performance and motions in attempting to improve hitting.

Some <a href="sabermetric">sabermetric</a> statistics have entered the mainstream baseball world that measure a batter's overall performance including <a href="on-base%20plus%20slugging">on-base plus slugging</a>, commonly referred to as OPS. OPS adds the hitter's <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> (number of times reached base by any means divided by total plate appearances) to his <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> (<a href="total%20bases">total bases</a> divided by at-bats). Some argue that the OPS formula is flawed and that more weight should be shifted towards OBP (on-base percentage). The statistic <a href="wOBA">wOBA</a> (weighted on-base average) attempts to correct for this.

OPS is also useful when determining a pitcher's level of success. "Opponent On-base Plus Slugging" (OOPS) is becoming a popular tool to evaluate a pitcher's actual performance. When analyzing a pitcher's statistics, some useful categories to consider include <a href="K/9IP">K/9IP</a> (strikeouts per nine innings), <a href="Strikeout-to-walk%20ratio">K/BB</a> (strikeouts per walk), <a href="Home%20runs%20per%20nine%20innings">HR/9</a> (Home runs per nine innings), <a href="Walks%20plus%20hits%20per%20inning%20pitched">WHIP</a> (walks plus hits per inning pitched) and OOPS (opponent on-base plus slugging).

However, since 2001, more emphasis has been placed on <a href="Defense%20independent%20pitching%20statistics">Defense-Independent Pitching Statistics</a>, including Defense-Independent ERA (dERA), in an attempt to evaluate a pitcher's performance regardless of the strength of the defensive players behind him.

All of the above statistics may be used in certain game situations. For example, a certain hitter's ability to hit left-handed pitchers might incline a manager to increase his opportunities to face left-handed pitchers. Other hitters may have a history of success against a given pitcher (or vice versa), and the manager may use this information to create a favorable
match-up. Broadcast commentators often refer to this as "playing the percentages".

Most of these terms also apply to <a href="softball">softball</a>. Commonly used statistics with their <a href="abbreviation">abbreviation</a>s are explained here. The explanations below are for quick reference and do not fully or completely define the statistic; for the strict definition, see the linked article for each statistic.







It is difficult to determine quantitatively what is considered to be a "good" value in a certain statistical category, and qualitative assessments may lead to arguments. Using full-season statistics available at the Official Site of Major League Baseball for the 2004 through 2015 seasons, the following tables show top ranges in various statistics, in alphabetical order. For each statistic, two values are given:

<doc id="3800" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3800" title="At bat">
At bat

In <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is a <a href="batting%20%28baseball%29">batter</a>'s turn batting against a <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a>. An at bat is different from a <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>. A batter is credited with a plate appearance regardless of what happens during his turn at bat. A batter is credited with an at bat only if that plate appearance does not have one of the results enumerated below. While at bats are used to calculate certain <a href="baseball%20statistics">statistics</a>, including <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> and <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a>, a player can qualify for the season-ending rankings in these categories only if he accumulates 502 plate appearances during the season.

A batter will not receive credit for an at bat if his plate appearance ends under the following circumstances:
In addition, if the <a href="Inning%20%28baseball%29">inning</a> ends while he is still at bat (due to the third <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">out</a> being made by a runner <a href="caught%20stealing">caught stealing</a>, for example), no at bat or plate appearance will result. In this case, the batter will come to bat again in the next inning, though the <a href="count%20%28baseball%29">count</a> will be reset to no balls and no strikes.

Section 10.02.a.1 of the official rules of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> defines an at bat as:
"Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (1) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (2) is awarded first base on four called balls; (3) is hit by a pitched ball; or (4) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction..."

An at bat is counted when:

"At bat", "up", "up at bat", and "at the plate" are all phrases describing a batter who is facing the pitcher. Note that just because a player is described as being "at bat" in this sense, he will not necessarily be given an at bat in his statistics; the phrase actually signifies a <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a> (assuming it is eventually completed). This ambiguous terminology is usually clarified by context. To refer explicitly to the technical meaning of "at bat" described above, the term "official at bat" is sometimes used.

<doc id="3801" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3801" title="Earned run">
Earned run

In <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, an earned run is any <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">run</a> that was fully enabled by the offensive team's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team. Conversely, an unearned run is a <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">run</a> that would not have been scored without the aid of an <a href="Error%20%28baseball%29">error</a> or a <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a> committed by the defense. 

An unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game. However, it is "unearned" in that it was, in a sense, "given away" by the defensive team. 

Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher's <a href="baseball%20statistics">statistics</a>. However, earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher's <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA), the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine <a href="innings%20pitched">innings pitched</a> (i.e., averaged over a regulation game). Thus, in effect, the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs, while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team. 

To determine whether a run is earned, the <a href="official%20scorer">official scorer</a> must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls.

If no errors and no passed balls occur during the inning, all runs scored are automatically earned (assigned responsible to the pitcher). Also, in some cases, an error can be rendered harmless as the inning progresses. For example, a runner on first base advances to second on a passed ball and the next batter walks. Since the runner would now have been at second anyway, the passed ball no longer has any effect on the earned/unearned calculation. On the other hand, a batter/runner may make his entire circuit around the bases without the aid of an error, yet the run would be counted as unearned if an error prevented the third out from being made before he crossed the plate to score.

An error made by the pitcher in fielding at his position is counted the same as an error by any other player.

A run is counted as unearned when:


While the inning is still being played, the second and last scenario can cause a temporary situation where a run has already scored, but its earned/unearned status is not yet certain. Under the last circumstance, for example, with two outs, a runner on <a href="third%20baseman">third base</a> scores on a passed ball. For the time being, the run is unearned since the runner "should" still be at third. If the batter <a href="strikeout">strikes out</a> to end the inning, it will stay that way. If the batter gets a <a href="base%20hit">base hit</a>, which would have scored the runner anyway, the run now becomes earned.

Under the second circumstance, if there are runners on base and a batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped, and then bats in the runners on base through a base hit (including a home run), the runs are unearned for the time being, as the runners should not have advanced. If the results of the remaining at bats in the inning would not have scored the runners, the runs remain unearned. However, if results of subsequent at bats would have scored the runs anyway, the runs would count as earned, unless they only would have scored as a result of a subsequent error or passed ball.

A runner who reaches on <a href="catcher%27s%20interference">catcher's interference</a> and subsequently scores with two outs scores an unearned run, but baserunners who subsequently score after the runner who has reached on catcher's interference exclusively on clean plays score earned runs; the baserunner cannot be assumed to have been put out except for the error. (Rule 10.16(4)).

Neither the use of a <a href="pinch-runner">pinch-runner</a> to replace a baserunner who represents an unearned run nor the use of a <a href="pinch-hitter">pinch-hitter</a> to continue the turn at bat of a batter who would be out except for an error transforms a run scored by such a person or his successors on base from an unearned run to an earned run.

When pitchers are changed in the middle of an inning, and one or more errors have already occurred, it is possible to have a run charged as earned against a specific pitcher, but unearned to the team. The simplest example is when the defensive team records two outs and makes an error on a play that would have been the third out. A new pitcher comes into the game, and the next batter hits a <a href="home%20run">home run</a>. The runner who reached on the error comes around to score, and his run is unearned to both the prior pitcher and the team. However, the run scored by the batter is counted as earned against the relief pitcher, but unearned to the team (since there should have already been three outs). Had the team not switched pitchers, neither run would be counted as an earned run because that pitcher should have already been out of that inning.

A pitcher who is relieved mid-inning may be charged with earned runs equal to the number of batters who reached base while he was pitching, even if the specific batters he faced do not score. The batters he put on base may be erased by fielder's choice plays after he has been relieved by another pitcher, but if earned runs are scored in the inning the original pitcher is liable for as many earned runs as the number of batters he put on base. 
Example: On April 15 2017 Justin Verlander allowed the first two Cleveland batters in the 5th inning to reach base on base hits; Verlander was then relieved by Shane Greene. Greene walked the next batter to load the bases. The next batter hit a grounder and Miguel Cabrera threw home to force out the runner on third in a fielder's choice, so the bases remained loaded with one out. Greene struck out the next batter for the second out. Carlos Santana then hit a single that scored the runners from second and third (only one of whom was put on base by Verlander), and the runner from first was thrown out at the plate to end the inning. Since Verlander allowed two batters to reach base he was charged with two earned runs, even though only one of the two specific batters he faced actually scored. 

When a pitching change occurs, the new pitcher is said to "<a href="List%20of%20baseball%20jargon%20%28I%29%23inherited%20runner">inherit</a>" any runners that are on base at the time, and if they later score, those runs are charged (earned or unearned) to the prior pitcher. Most <a href="box%20score%20%28baseball%29">box scores</a> now list inherited runners, and the number that scored, as a statistic for the relief pitcher.

<doc id="3802" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3802" title="Base on balls">
Base on balls

A base on balls (BB), also known as a walk, occurs in <a href="baseball">baseball</a> when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls "<a href="strike%20zone">balls</a>", and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out. The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball's Official Rules, and further detail is given in 6.08(a). It is, however, considered a faux pas for a <a href="professional%20baseball">professional</a> player to actually walk to first base; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play.

The term "base on balls" distinguishes a walk from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out (e.g., <a href="hit%20by%20pitch">hit by pitch</a> (HBP), <a href="catcher%27s%20interference">catcher's interference</a>). Though a base on balls, catcher's interference, or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter (and possibly runners on base) being awarded a base, the term "walk" usually refers only to a base on balls, and not the other methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball. An important difference is that for a hit batter or catcher's interference, the ball is dead and no one may advance unless forced; the ball is live after a walk (see below for details).

A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been "walked" by the pitcher. When the batter is walked, runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base. If a batter draws a walk with the <a href="bases%20loaded">bases loaded</a>, all preceding runners are forced to advance, including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run; when a run is forced on a walk, the batter is credited with an <a href="Run%20batted%20in">RBI</a> per rule 10.04.

Receiving a base on balls does not count as a <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a> or an <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a> for a batter but does count as a <a href="times%20on%20base">time on base</a> and a <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>. Therefore, a base on balls does not affect a player's <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>, but it can increase his <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a>.

A <a href="hit%20by%20pitch">hit by pitch</a> is not counted statistically as a walk, though the effect is mostly the same, with the batter receiving a free pass to first base. One exception is that on a HBP (hit-by-pitch), the ball is dead. On a HBP, any runners attempting to steal on the play must return to their original base unless forced to the next base anyway. When a walk occurs, the ball is still live: any runner not forced to advance may nevertheless attempt to advance at his own risk, which might occur on a <a href="steal%20%28baseball%29">steal</a> play, <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a>, or <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a>. Also, because a ball is live when a base on balls occurs, runners on base forced to advance one base may attempt to advance beyond one base, at their own risk. The batter-runner himself may attempt to advance beyond first base, at his own risk. Rule 6.08 addresses this matter as well. An attempt to advance an additional base beyond the base awarded might occur when ball four is a <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a> or a <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a>.

In 1880, the National League changed the rules so that eight balls instead of nine were required for a walk. In 1884, the National League changed the rules so that six balls were required for a walk. In 1886, the American Association changed the rules so that six balls instead of seven were required for a walk; however, the National League changed the rules so that seven balls were required for a walk instead of six. In 1887, the National League and American Association agreed to abide by some uniform rule changes and decreased the number of balls required for a walk to five. In 1889, the National League and the American Association decreased the number of balls required for a walk to four. In 2017, Major League Baseball approved a rule change allowing for a batter to be walked intentionally by having the defending bench signal to the Umpire. The move was met with some controversy.

A subset of the base on balls, an intentional base on balls (IBB) or intentional walk is when the pitcher deliberately pitches the ball away from the batter in order to issue a base on balls. As with any other walk, an intentional walk entitles the batter to first base without liability to be put out, and entitles any runners to advance if forced. Intentional walks are a strategic defensive maneuver, commonly done to bypass one hitter for one the defensive team believes is less likely to initiate a run-scoring play (e.g., a <a href="home%20run">home run</a>, <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a>, or <a href="Run%20batted%20in">RBI</a> <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">base hit</a>). Teams also commonly use intentional walks to set up a <a href="double%20play">double play</a> or <a href="force%20play">force out</a> situation for the next batter.

Intentional walks do carry risks, however. They carry an obvious, inherent risk: they give the offensive team another runner on base, without any effort on their part, who could potentially score a run. They may carry additional risks.

An intentional walk is signaled by the catcher standing and extending one arm to the side away from the batter. The pitcher then pitches the ball to that side several feet outside from home plate, usually outside the reach of the batter. A ball pitched in this manner is called an intentional ball and counts as a ball in the pitcher's <a href="pitch%20count">pitch count</a>. In order to count as an intentional ball, the ball must be legally pitched, i.e., the pitcher's foot must be on the <a href="baseball%20field%23Pitcher%27s%20mound">pitcher's rubber</a>, the catcher must be in the <a href="baseball%20field%23Batter%27s%20box%20and%20catcher%27s%20box">catcher's box</a>, and the batter must be in the <a href="baseball%20field%23Batter%27s%20box%20and%20catcher%27s%20box">batter's box</a> appearing ready to take a pitch at the time the ball is thrown. An intentional walk may be signaled at any time during the batter's turn at the plate; in these cases only enough additional intentional balls need to be thrown to bring the total to four. Only walks issued by the catcher signaling as described above are recorded as intentional walks (see below); walks issued without the catcher signaling – even if the pitches "are" intentionally thrown outside of the strike zone – are not recorded as intentional.

Another risk taken by the defensive team in issuing a base on balls is that since intentional balls must be pitched in a legal manner, they can legally become <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a>es or <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a>s. Likewise, a baserunner can attempt to <a href="stolen%20base">steal</a> a base, or the batter can choose to swing at an intentional ball; however, these rarely occur since taking these risks is rarely more beneficial to the offensive team than allowing the walk. In the Major Leagues, the most recent example of a swing at an intentional ball resulting in a hit occurred during a June 22, 2006 game between the <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a> and the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. In the top of the 10th inning, with a runner on second base, Baltimore pitcher <a href="Todd%20Williams">Todd Williams</a> was signaled to intentionally walk the Marlins' <a href="Miguel%20Cabrera">Miguel Cabrera</a>. Noticing that the intentional ball came in too close to the plate, Cabrera swung at the ball, resulting in a base hit, and a run scored for Florida.

Intentional walks also carry other nuanced risks. They might give the subsequent batter the strategic advantage of anticipating that the pitcher will avoid walking him. This subsequent batter might then more aggressively anticipate a pitch in the strike zone. If this batter guesses correctly, he could achieve more success than he otherwise would. Moreover, a subsequent batter might perceive an immediately preceding intentional walk as a slight to his abilities; if such a batter performs better when he feels underestimated by his opposition, an intentional walk could provide a spark.

Though intentional walks are recorded as such in the records of the <a href="official%20scorer">official scorer</a>, they are combined with standard, non-intentional walks when calculating a player's on-base percentage, and have only received a separate column in a player's statistics since <a href="1955%20in%20baseball">1955</a>.

Batters, on occasion, have been given intentional walks with the bases loaded (effectively giving the offensive team a risk-free run), although this occurs very infrequently.

A common nickname for the intentional walk is four-finger salute, since most <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">managers</a> call for an intentional walk by holding up four fingers. As of 2017, the manager may simply request to the plate umpire to let the batter go to first instead of having the pitcher waste four outside pitches.

<a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a> is the all-time record holder with 688 intentional bases on balls. The next most is <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a> with 293.

List of Major League Baseball career total bases leaders

In <a href="baseball%20statistics">baseball statistics</a>, total bases (TBs) is the number of bases a player has gained with <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a>. It is a <a href="weighted%20sum">weighted sum</a> for which the weight value is 1 for a <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">single</a>, 2 for a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a>, 3 for a <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triple</a> and 4 for a <a href="home%20run">home run</a>. Only bases attained from hits count toward this total. Reaching base by other means (such as a <a href="base%20on%20balls">base on balls</a>) or advancing further after the hit (such as when a subsequent batter gets a hit) does not increase the player's total bases.

The total bases divided by the number of <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s is the player's <a href="slugging%20average">slugging average</a>.

Hit by pitch

In <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, hit by pitch (HBP) is a situation in which a <a href="batter%20%28baseball%29">batter</a> or his clothing or equipment (other than his bat) is struck directly by a pitch from the <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a>; the batter is called a hit batsman (HB). A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire. Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to, or "crowding", home plate.

Per baseball official rule 5.05(b), a batter becomes a <a href="baserunning">baserunner</a> and is awarded first base when he or his equipment (except for his bat):
If all these conditions are met, the ball is dead, and other baserunners advance if they are forced to vacate their base by the batter taking first. Rule 5.09(a) further clarifies that a hit by pitch is also called when a pitch touches a batter's clothing.

In the case where a batter swings and the pitch hits him anyway, the ball is <a href="dead%20ball%23Baseball">dead</a> and a <a href="strike%20zone">strike</a> is called. If the batter does not attempt to avoid the pitch, he is not awarded first base, and the pitch is ruled either a strike if in the strike zone or a ball if out of the strike zone. Umpires rarely make this call. A famous instance of a non-hit by pitch was on May 31, 1968, when <a href="Don%20Drysdale">Don Drysdale</a> hit <a href="Dick%20Dietz">Dick Dietz</a> with a pitch that would have forced in a run and ended Drysdale's scoreless innings streak at 44. Umpire <a href="Harry%20Wendelstedt">Harry Wendelstedt</a> ruled that Dietz made no effort to avoid the pitch; Dietz proceeded to <a href="fly%20out">fly out</a>, and Drysdale's scoreless streak continued to a then-record 58 innings.

A hit-by-pitch can also be called on a pitch that has first touched the ground before hitting the batter. Such a bouncing pitch is like any other, and if a batter is hit by such a pitch, he will be awarded first unless he made no attempt to avoid it (and he had an opportunity to avoid it).

A batter hit by a pitch is not credited with a <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a> or <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>, but is credited with a <a href="times%20on%20base">time on base</a> and a <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>; therefore, being hit by a pitch does not increase or decrease a player's <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> but does increase his <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a>. A batter hit by a pitch with the <a href="bases%20loaded">bases loaded</a> is also credited with an <a href="Run%20batted%20in">RBI</a> per MLB rule 10.04(a)(2). A pitch ruled a hit by pitch is recorded as a ball in the pitcher's <a href="pitch%20count">pitch count</a>, since by definition the ball must be outside the strike zone and not have been swung at.

The rule awarding first base to a batter hit by a pitch was instituted in 1887.

<a href="Inside%20pitching">Inside pitching</a> is a common and legal tactic in <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, and many players make use of <a href="brushback%20pitch">brushback pitch</a>es, or pitches aimed underneath the chin, commonly referred to as "chin music", to keep players away from the <a href="home%20plate">plate</a>. "Headhunter" is a common term for pitchers who have a reputation for throwing these kinds of pitches. However, throwing at a batter intentionally is illegal, and can be very dangerous. When an <a href="umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpire</a> suspects that a pitcher has thrown at a batter intentionally, but is not certain, a warning is issued to the pitcher and the <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">managers</a> of both teams. From that point on, any pitch thrown at a batter can cause the pitcher and the manager of the offending team to be ejected immediately from the game. Serious offenses such as a ball thrown at the head (called a <a href="beanball">beanball</a>) can result in the immediate ejection of the pitcher, and the manager if he ordered the beanball, even without a warning. If the umpire is certain that the pitcher intentionally hit the batter with the pitch, the pitcher is ejected from the game with no warning.

Often, if a player is acting rude or unsportsmanlike, or having an extraordinarily good day, the pitcher may intentionally hit the batter, disguising it as a pitch that accidentally slipped his control. Managers may also order a pitcher to throw such a pitch (sometimes called a "plunking"). These pitches are often aimed at the lower back and slower than normal, designed to send a message more than anything else. The opposing team usually hits a batter in retaliation for this act. The plunkings generally end there because of umpire warnings, but in some cases things can get out of hand, and sometimes they lead to the batter <a href="charging%20the%20mound">charging the mound</a>, <a href="bench-clearing%20brawl">bench-clearing brawl</a>s, and several ejections. The strategy in these games can vary by the circumstances the teams are playing in within major league games, as <a href="American%20League">American League</a> pitchers are prevented from facing the opposing pitcher in intra-league games due to the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> rule outside of rare circumstances. In <a href="National%20League">National League</a> games and <a href="Interleague%20play">interleague games</a> at National League home parks, pitchers must always bat for themselves and open themselves up to direct retaliation, though one of baseball's unsaid rules makes hitting a fellow pitcher a serious breach of baseball etiquette.

The all-time record for a player being hit by a pitch is held by <a href="Hughie%20Jennings">Hughie Jennings</a>, who was hit by 287 pitches between 1891 and 1903. The modern-day record is held by <a href="Craig%20Biggio">Craig Biggio</a> of the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a>, who had 285 as of the end of the 2007 season when he retired. Prior to Biggio, the modern-day record belonged to <a href="Don%20Baylor">Don Baylor</a>, who was hit 267 times.

The all-time single-season record also belongs to Jennings, who was hit 51 times during the 1896 season. <a href="Ron%20Hunt">Ron Hunt</a> of the 1971 <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a> was hit 50 times during that year, the modern-day record. The single-game record is three, held by numerous players.

The all-time record for pitchers is held by <a href="Gus%20Weyhing">Gus Weyhing</a> with 277 (1887–1901). The modern-day career pitching record for most hit batsmen is 205 by Hall-of-Famer <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>. The season record is 54 by <a href="Phil%20Knell">Phil Knell</a> in 1891, and the game record is six, held by Ed Knouff and John Grimes.

<a href="Brady%20Anderson">Brady Anderson</a> was the first player to be hit by a pitch two times in the same inning in an <a href="American%20League">American League</a> game. On April 25, 2014, <a href="Brandon%20Moss">Brandon Moss</a> became the second when he was hit twice in the top of the 9th inning by <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> pitchers. Five players have been hit by a pitch twice in the same inning in the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>.

Twice has a perfect game been busted by the 27th batter being hit by pitch. <a href="Hooks%20Wiltse">Hooks Wiltse</a> and <a href="Max%20Scherzer">Max Scherzer</a> hold this rare feat. Both finished with no-hitters after the hit by pitch. Scherzer's team was leading 6-0 when he pitched his no-hitter, but Wiltse's team was scoreless through 9; he pitched a 10-inning 1–0 no-hitter. The record for most hit batters in a no-hitter is three, held by <a href="Chris%20Heston">Chris Heston</a> of the San Francisco Giants for his 2015 effort against the New York Mets.

One major league player died as a result of being struck by a pitch: <a href="Ray%20Chapman">Ray Chapman</a> of the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> was hit in the head by <a href="Carl%20Mays">Carl Mays</a> on August 16, 1920, and died the next morning.

Serious injuries may result from being hit by a pitch, even when wearing a helmet. On August 18, 1967, <a href="Red%20Sox">Red Sox</a> batter <a href="Tony%20Conigliaro">Tony Conigliaro</a> was hit almost directly in the left eye by a fastball thrown by <a href="Jack%20Hamilton%20%28baseball%29">Jack Hamilton</a> of the <a href="California%20Angels">California Angels</a>. His cheekbone was shattered, he nearly lost the sight of the eye, was unable to play for over a year, and never regained his earlier batting ability. Batting helmets at the time were not required to have an "ear flap"; it was not until 2002 that all Major League batters were required to wear helmets with side-protection. On September 28, 1995, <a href="Kirby%20Puckett">Kirby Puckett</a>, of the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>, was struck in the cheek by a <a href="Dennis%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Dennis Martínez</a> fastball, breaking his jaw and loosening two teeth. It would be his last regular-season game; during spring training the following year he developed glaucoma, which ended his career. Most recently, <a href="Mike%20Piazza">Mike Piazza</a>, then of the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>, was hit in the head by a pitch from <a href="Juli%C3%A1n%20Tav%C3%A1rez">Julián Tavárez</a> of the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> on September 10, 2005. His helmet shattered, and he suffered a <a href="concussion">concussion</a>. Other relatively minor injuries that are possible include broken fingers or hands, broken feet, broken ribs, injuries to the knee, or <a href="groin">groin</a> injuries.

Since inside pitching is a legitimate tactic in baseball, courts have recognized that being hit by a pitch is an inherent risk of the game, so that players cannot sue for any resulting injuries. On April 6, 2006, in a case arising from a game involving <a href="community%20college">community college</a> baseball teams, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20California">Supreme Court of California</a> ruled that baseball players in California <a href="Assumption%20of%20risk">assume the risk</a> of being hit by baseballs "even if" the balls were intentionally thrown so as to cause injury. In the court's words: "For better or worse, being intentionally thrown at is a fundamental part and inherent risk of the sport of baseball. It is not the function of <a href="tort%20law">tort law</a> to police such conduct."

Hit (baseball)

In <a href="baseball%20statistics">baseball statistics</a>, a hit (denoted by H), also called a base hit, is credited to a <a href="batting%20%28baseball%29">batter</a> when the batter safely reaches <a href="First%20baseman">first base</a> after hitting the ball into <a href="fair%20ball">fair</a> territory, without the benefit of an <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">error</a> or a <a href="fielder%27s%20choice">fielder's choice</a>.

To achieve a hit, the batter must reach first base before any fielder can either <a href="tag%20out">tag</a> him with the ball, throw to another player protecting the base before the batter reaches it, or <a href="force%20play">tag first base</a> while carrying the ball. The hit is scored the moment the batter reaches first base safely; if he is put out while attempting to stretch his hit to a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a> or <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triple</a> or home run on the same play, he still gets credit for a hit (according to the last base he reached safely on the play).

If a batter reaches first base because of offensive interference by a preceding runner (including if a preceding runner is hit by a batted ball), he is also credited with a hit.

A hit for one base is called a <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">single</a>, for two bases a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a>, and for three bases a <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triple</a>. A <a href="home%20run">home run</a> is also scored as a hit. Doubles, triples, and home runs are also called <a href="extra%20base%20hit">extra base hit</a>s.

An "<a href="infield%20hit">infield hit</a>" is a hit where the ball does not leave the infield. Infield hits are uncommon by nature, and most often earned by speedy runners.

A <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> is a game in which one of the teams prevented the other from getting a hit. Throwing a no-hitter is rare and considered an extraordinary accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff. In most cases in the professional game, no-hitters are accomplished by a single pitcher who throws a complete game. A pitcher who throws a no-hitter could still allow runners to reach base safely, by way of <a href="base%20on%20balls">walk</a>s, <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">error</a>s, <a href="hit%20by%20pitch">hit batsmen</a>, or batter reaching base due to interference or obstruction. If the pitcher allows no runners to reach base in any manner whatsoever (hit, walk, hit batsman, error, etc.), the no-hitter is a <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a>.

In <a href="1887%20in%20baseball">1887</a>, <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> counted <a href="Base%20on%20balls">bases on balls</a> (walks) as hits. The result was skyrocketing <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>s, including some near .500; <a href="Tip%20O%27Neill%20%28baseball%29">Tip O'Neill</a> of the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns%20%28NL%29">St. Louis Browns</a> batted .485 that season, which would still be a major league record if recognized. The experiment was abandoned the following season.

There is controversy regarding how the records of 1887 should be interpreted. The number of legitimate walks and at-bats are known for all players that year, so computing averages using the same method as in other years is straightforward. In 1968, Major League Baseball formed a Special Baseball Records Committee to resolve this (and other) issues. The Committee ruled that walks in 1887 should not be counted as hits. In 2000, Major League Baseball reversed its decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Most current sources list O'Neill's 1887 average as .435, as calculated by omitting his walks. He would retain his <a href="American%20Association%20%2819th%20century%29">American Association</a> batting championship. However, the variance between methods results in differing recognition for the 1887 <a href="National%20League">National League</a> batting champion. <a href="Cap%20Anson">Cap Anson</a> would be recognized, with his .421 average, if walks are included, but <a href="Sam%20Thompson">Sam Thompson</a> would be the champion at .372 if they are not.

The official rulebook of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> states in Rule 10.05:
Rule 10.05(a) Comment: In applying Rule 10.05(a), the official scorer shall always give the batter the benefit of the doubt. A safe course for the official scorer to follow is to score a hit when exceptionally good fielding of a ball fails to result in a putout.

<doc id="3808" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3808" title="On-base percentage">
On-base percentage

In <a href="baseball%20statistics">baseball statistics</a>, on-base percentage (OBP; sometimes referred to as on-base average/OBA, as the statistic is rarely presented as a true <a href="percentage">percentage</a>) is a statistic generally measuring how frequently a <a href="batting%20%28baseball%29">batter</a> reaches <a href="base%20%28baseball%29">base</a>. Specifically, it records the ratio of the batter's <a href="Times%20on%20base">times-on-base (TOB)</a> (the sum of <a href="Hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a>, <a href="Base%20on%20balls">walks</a>, and times <a href="Hit%20by%20pitch">hit by pitch</a>) to their number of plate appearances. It first became an official <a href="MLB">MLB</a> statistic in 1984.

By factoring in only hits, walks and times hit by pitch, OBP does not credit the batter for reaching base due to fielding errors or decisions, as it does not increase when the batter reaches base due to <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">fielding error</a>, <a href="fielder%27s%20choice">fielder's choice</a>, <a href="Uncaught%20third%20strike">dropped/uncaught third strike</a>, <a href="Obstruction%20%28baseball%29">fielder's obstruction</a>, or <a href="catcher%27s%20interference">catcher's interference</a>.

On-base percentage is added to <a href="slugging%20average">slugging average</a> to determine <a href="on-base%20plus%20slugging">on-base plus slugging</a> (OPS). The on-base percentage of all batters faced by one pitcher or team is referred to as on-base against.

Traditionally, players with the best on-base percentages bat as <a href="leadoff%20hitter">leadoff hitter</a>, unless they are power hitters, who traditionally bat slightly lower in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">batting order</a>. The league average for on-base percentage in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> has varied considerably over time; at its peak in the late 1990s, it was around .340, whereas it was typically .300 during the <a href="dead-ball%20era">dead-ball era</a>. On-base percentage can also vary quite considerably from player to player. The record for the highest career OBP by a hitter, based on over 3000 <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>s, is .482 by <a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a>. The lowest is by <a href="Bill%20Bergen">Bill Bergen</a>, who had an OBP of .194.

On-base percentage is calculated using this formula:

where


In certain unofficial calculations, the denominator is simplified and replaced by <a href="Plate%20appearance">Plate Appearance</a> (PA); however, the calculation PAs includes certain infrequent events that will slightly lower the calculated OBP (i.e. <a href="catcher%27s%20interference">catcher's interference</a>, and <a href="sacrifice%20bunt">sacrifice bunt</a>s). Sacrifice bunts are excluded from consideration on the basis that they are usually imposed by the manager with the expectation that the batter will not reach base, and thus do not accurately reflect the batter's ability to reach base when attempting to do so.

<doc id="3809" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3809" title="Sacrifice fly">
Sacrifice fly

In <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, a sacrifice fly (sometimes abbreviated to sac fly) is a batted ball that satisfies four criteria:


It is called a "sacrifice" fly because the batter presumably intends to allow a teammate to score a run, while sacrificing their own ability to do so. Sacrifice flies are traditionally recorded in <a href="box%20score%20%28baseball%29">box scores</a> with the designation "SF".

As addressed within Rule 10.08(d) of the Official Baseball Rules, a sacrifice fly is not counted as a turn <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a> for the batter, though the batter is credited with a <a href="run%20batted%20in">run batted in</a>.

The purpose of not counting a sacrifice fly as an at-bat is to avoid penalizing hitters for a successful action. The sacrifice fly is one of two instances in baseball where a batter is not charged with a time at bat after putting a ball in play; the other is the <a href="sacrifice%20hit">sacrifice hit</a> (also known as a sacrifice bunt). But, while a sacrifice fly doesn't affect a player's <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>, it counts as a <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>, thus lowering his <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a>, and a player on a <a href="hitting%20streak">hitting streak</a> will have the hit streak end if he has no official at-bats but has a sacrifice fly. The reason for this is that the sacrifice fly, unlike the sacrifice bunt, is not considered a tactical maneuver (players don't try to hit a fly ball to advance a runner). Unlike a sacrifice bunt, which may be scored if a runner advances from any base to any base, a sacrifice fly is only credited if a runner scores on the play. Therefore, when a runner on first or second base tags on a fly ball and advances no further than third base, no sacrifice is given and the batter is charged with an at-bat. Also, if a runner tags and advances from second base (or, theoretically, from first base) all the way to home and scores (without an intervening error) the batter is credited with a sacrifice fly, as well as a second RBI if a runner on third also scores. At the professional level this will only typically occur in unusual circumstances that prevent the defense from making an immediate throw back to the infield, such as an outfielder colliding with the wall while making a catch on the warning track. 

The sacrifice fly is credited even if another runner is put out on appeal for failing to <a href="tag%20up">tag up</a>, so long as a run scores prior to the third out. In the case of a fly ball dropped for an error, the sacrifice fly is only credited if the official scorer believes the run would have scored had the ball been caught.

On any fly ball, a runner can attempt to advance bases right as a fielder touches the ball. If the fielder bobbles the ball, the runner may still tag up, even before the fielder has full control of the ball (before the fielder is credited with a putout). The rule works this way because a smart fielder can theoretically purposely bobble the ball and run with it at the same time towards the infield and only completely catch it when he is within a good throwing distance to home plate. As addressed in the Official Baseball Rules, this was put into the baseball rulebook so it prevented these fielders from intentionally bobbling the ball.

The most sacrifice flies by a team in one game is five; the record was established by the <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> in 1988, tied by the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Colorado Rockies</a> in 2006, and tied again by the Mariners in 2008. 

Five teams have collected three sacrifice flies in an inning: the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> (fifth inning, July 1, 1962 against the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>); the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> twice (fourth inning, June 29, 2000 against the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and third inning, August 19, 2000 against the <a href="Anaheim%20Angels">Anaheim Angels</a>); the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> (second inning, June 24, 2005 against the Yankees); and the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> (seventh inning, June 26, 2005 against the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a>). In these cases one or more of the flies did not result in a putout due to an error.

Since the rule was reinstated in its present form in 1954, <a href="Gil%20Hodges">Gil Hodges</a> of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Dodgers</a> holds the record for most sacrifice flies in one season with 19, in 1954; <a href="Eddie%20Murray">Eddie Murray</a> holds the record for most sacrifice flies in a career with 128.

As of the end of the <a href="2008%20in%20baseball">2008 season</a>, players who have hit 115 or more career sacrifice flies:

1. <a href="Eddie%20Murray">Eddie Murray</a> (128)<BR>

Batters have not been charged with a time at-bat for a sacrifice hit since 1893, but baseball has changed the sacrifice fly rule multiple times. The sacrifice fly as a statistical category was instituted in 1908, only to be discontinued in 1931. The rule was again adopted in 1939, only to be eliminated again in 1940, before being adopted for the last time in 1954.

On-base plus slugging

On-base plus slugging (OPS) is a <a href="Sabermetrics">sabermetric</a> <a href="baseball%20statistics">baseball statistic</a> calculated as the sum of a player's <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> and <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging average</a>. The ability of a player both to get on base and to hit for power, two important offensive skills, are represented. An OPS of .900 or higher in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters. Typically, the league leader in OPS will score near, and sometimes above, the 1.000 mark.

The basic equation is

formula_1
where OBP is <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> and SLG is <a href="Slugging%20percentage">slugging average</a>. These averages are defined

formula_2

and

formula_3

where:

In one equation, OPS can be represented as:

formula_4

OPS does not present a complete picture of a player's offensive contributions. OPS does not consider such factors as <a href="baserunning">baserunning</a>, <a href="stolen%20base">basestealing</a>, and the <a href="clutch%20hitter">leverage/timeliness of performance</a>.

More expansive sabermetric measurements do attempt to incorporate some or all of the abovementioned factors. Nonetheless, even though it does not include them, OPS correlates quite well with team run scoring.

Other sabermetric stats, such as <a href="runs%20created">runs created</a> and <a href="Wins%20Above%20Replacement">Wins Above Replacement</a>, attempt to express a player's contribution directly in terms of runs and/or wins. However, a player's OPS does not have a simple intrinsic meaning.

OPS is a convenient but controversial measurement. OPS weighs on-base percentage and slugging average equally. However, on-base percentage correlates better with scoring runs. Statistics such as <a href="wOBA">wOBA</a> build on this distinction using <a href="linear%20weights">linear weights</a>. Additionally, the components of OPS are not typically equal (league-average slugging percentages are usually 75–100 points higher than league-average on-base percentages). As a point of reference, the OPS for all of Major League Baseball in 2008 was .749.

<a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a>, in his essay titled "The 96 Families of Hitters" uses seven different categories for classification by OPS:

This effectively transforms OPS into a 7-point ordinal scale. Substituting quality labels such as Excellent (A), Very Good (B), Good (C), Average (D), Fair (E), Poor (F) and Very Poor (G) for the A–G categories creates a subjective reference for OPS values.

On-base plus slugging was first popularized in 1984 by <a href="John%20Thorn">John Thorn</a> and <a href="Pete%20Palmer">Pete Palmer</a>'s book, "The Hidden Game of Baseball". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" then began carrying the leaders in this statistic in its weekly "By the Numbers" box, a feature that continued for four years. Baseball journalist <a href="Peter%20Gammons">Peter Gammons</a> used and evangelized the statistic, and other writers and broadcasters picked it up. The popularity of OPS gradually spread, and by 2004 it began appearing on <a href="Topps">Topps</a> baseball cards.

OPS was formerly sometimes known as "Production." For instance, in early versions of Thorn's "<a href="Total%20Baseball">Total Baseball</a>" encyclopedia, and in the "<a href="Strat-O-Matic">Strat-O-Matic</a>" computer baseball game. This term has fallen out of use.

The top twenty <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> players in lifetime OPS, with at least 3,000 plate appearances through the end of the 2016 season and halfway through 2017 season, are:


The top four were all left-handed batters. <a href="Jimmie%20Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a> has the highest career OPS for a right-handed batter.

The highest single-season mark for a right-handed hitter was 1.2449 by <a href="Rogers%20Hornsby">Rogers Hornsby</a> in , 13th on the all-time list. Since 1925, the highest single-season OPS for a right-hander is 1.2224 by <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a> in , which was 16th all-time.

OPS+, Adjusted OPS, is a closely related statistic. OPS+ is OPS adjusted for the park and the league in which the player played, but not for fielding position. An OPS+ of 100 is defined to be the league average. An OPS+ of 150 or more is excellent and 125 very good, while an OPS+ of 75 or below is poor.

The basic equation for OPS+ is

formula_5

where *lgOBP is the park adjusted OBP of the league (not counting pitchers hitting) and *lgSLG is the park adjusted SLG of the league.

A common misconception is that OPS+ closely matches the ratio of a player's OPS to that of the league. In fact, due to the additive nature of the two components in OPS+, a player with an OBP and SLG both 50% better than league average in those metrics will have an OPS+ of 200 (twice the league average OPS+) while still having an OPS that is only 50% better than the average OPS of the league. It would be a better (although not exact) approximation to say that a player with an OPS+ of 150 produces 50% more "runs", in a given set of plate appearances, as a player with an OPS+ of 100.

Through the end of the 2016 season, the career top twenty leaders in OPS+ (minimum 3,000 plate appearances) were:

If Dunlap's and Barnes' seasons were to be eliminated from the list, two other Ruth seasons (1926 and 1927) would be on the list. This would also eliminate the only right-handed batter in the list, Barnes.

Stolen base

In <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, a stolen base occurs when a runner advances to a base to which he is not entitled and the <a href="official%20scorer">official scorer</a> rules that the advance should be credited to the action of the runner. The <a href="umpire">umpire</a>s determine whether the runner is safe or out at the next base, but the official scorer rules on the question of credit or blame for the advance under Rule 10.

A stolen base most often occurs when a <a href="baserunner">baserunner</a> advances to the next base while the <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> is pitching the ball to <a href="home%20plate">home plate</a>.

Successful base stealers are not only fast but have good baserunning instincts and timing.

<a href="Ned%20Cuthbert">Ned Cuthbert</a>, playing for the <a href="Philadelphia%20Keystones">Philadelphia Keystones</a> in either 1863 or 1865, was the first player to steal a base in a baseball game, although the term stolen base was not used until 1870. For a time in the 19th century, stolen bases were credited when a baserunner reached an extra base on a base hit from another player. For example, if a runner on <a href="First%20baseman">first base</a> reached <a href="Third%20baseman">third base</a> on a single, it counted as a steal. In 1887, <a href="Hugh%20Nicol">Hugh Nicol</a> set a still-standing Major League record with 138 stolen bases, many of which would not have counted under modern rules. Modern steal rules were fully implemented in 1898.
Base stealing was popular in the game's early decades, with speedsters such as <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> and <a href="Clyde%20Milan">Clyde Milan</a> stealing nearly 100 bases in a season. But the tactic fell into relative disuse after <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> introduced the era of the home run – in 1955, for example, no one in baseball stole more than 25 bases, and <a href="Dom%20DiMaggio">Dom DiMaggio</a> won the AL stolen base title in 1950 with just 15. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, base-stealing was brought back to prominence primarily by <a href="Luis%20Aparicio">Luis Aparicio</a> and <a href="Maury%20Wills">Maury Wills</a>, who broke Cobb's modern single-season record by stealing 104 bases in 1962. Wills' record was broken in turn by <a href="Lou%20Brock">Lou Brock</a> in 1974, and <a href="Rickey%20Henderson">Rickey Henderson</a> in 1982. The stolen base remained a popular tactic through the 1980s, perhaps best exemplified by <a href="Vince%20Coleman">Vince Coleman</a> and the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, but began to decline again in the 1990s as the frequency of <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s reached record heights and the steal-friendly <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a> ballparks began to disappear.

Base stealing is an important characteristic of the "<a href="small%20ball%20%28baseball%29">small ball</a>" managing style (or "manufacturing runs"). Such managers emphasize "doing the little things" (including risky running plays like base-stealing) to advance runners and score runs, often relying on pitching and defense to keep games close. The <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> of the 1960s, led by pitcher <a href="Sandy%20Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> and speedy shortstop <a href="Maury%20Wills">Maury Wills</a>, were a successful example of this style. The antithesis of this is reliance on power hitting, exemplified by the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> of the 1970s, which aspired to score most of its runs via home runs. Often the "small ball" model is associated with the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>, while power hitting is associated with the <a href="American%20League">American League</a>. However, some successful recent American League teams, including the <a href="2002%20in%20baseball">2002</a> <a href="Anaheim%20Angels">Anaheim Angels</a>, the <a href="2001%20in%20baseball">2001</a> <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> and the <a href="2005%20in%20baseball">2005</a> <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> have excelled at "small ball." The <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> have embodied this style recently, leading the league in stolen bases but finishing last in <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s in 2013 and 2014. Successful teams often combine both styles, with a speedy runner or two complementing hitters with power, such as the 2005 White Sox, who despite playing "small ball", still hit 200 home runs.

Baseball's Rule 8 (The Pitcher) specifies the pitching procedure in detail. For example, in the Set Position, the pitcher must "com[e] to a complete stop"; thereafter, "any natural motion associated with his delivery of the ball to the batter commits him to the pitch without alteration or interruption." A runner intending to "steal on the pitcher" breaks for the next base the moment the pitcher commits to pitch to home plate. The pitcher cannot abort the pitch and try to put the runner out; this is a <a href="Balk%20%28baseball%29">balk</a> under Rule 8.

If the runner breaks too soon (before the pitcher is obliged to complete a pitch), the pitcher may throw to a base rather than pitch, and the runner is usually "picked off" by being tagged out between the bases. Past this moment, any delay in the runner's break makes it more likely that the catcher, after receiving the pitch, will be able to throw the runner out at the destination base.

Before the pitch, the runner takes a "lead-off", walking several steps away from the base as a <a href="Head%20start%20%28positioning%29">head start</a> toward the next base. Even a runner who does not intend to steal takes a "secondary lead" of a few more steps, once the pitcher has legally committed to complete the pitch.

The pitcher may, without limit, throw the ball to the runner's base. The runner must return to that base or risk being tagged out; but the underlying strategy is thereby to dissuade the runner from too big a lead-off; that is, to "hold the runner on" his original base.

The more adept base stealers are proficient at "reading the pickoff", meaning that they can detect certain "tells" (tell-tale signs) in a pitcher's pre-pitch movements or mannerisms that indicate the pickoff attempt is or is not imminent. For example, one experienced base stealer noted that careless pitchers dig the toes on their back foot into the ground when they are about to pitch in order to get a better push off, but when they intend to turn and throw a pickoff, they do not.

If a batted ball is caught on the fly, the runner must return to his original base. In this case, a runner trying to steal is more likely to be caught off his original base, resulting in a <a href="Double%20play">doubleplay</a>. This is a minor risk of a steal attempt. It is offset by the fact that a ground ball doubleplay is less likely.

In the "<a href="hit%20and%20run%20%28baseball%29">hit-and-run play</a>", coaches coordinate the actions of runner and batter. The runner tries to steal and the batter swings at almost any pitch, if only to distract the catcher. If the batter makes contact, the runner has a greater chance of reaching the next base; if the batter gets a base hit, the runner may be able to take an extra base. If the batter fails to hit the ball, the hit-and-run becomes a pure steal attempt.

In the "delayed steal", the runner does not take advantage of the pitcher's duty to complete a pitch, but relies on surprise and takes advantage of any complacency by the fielders. The runner gives the impression he is not trying to steal, and does not break for the next base until the ball crosses the plate. It is rare for Major League defenses to be fooled, but the play is used effectively at the college level. The first delayed steal on record was performed by <a href="Miller%20Huggins">Miller Huggins</a> in 1903. The delayed steal was famously practiced by <a href="Eddie%20Stanky">Eddie Stanky</a> of the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>.

<a href="Second%20base">Second base</a> is the base most often stolen, because once a runner is on second base he is considered to be in "scoring position", meaning that he is expected to be able to run home and score on most routine singles hit into the outfield. Second base is also the easiest to steal, as it is farthest from home plate and thus a longer throw from the catcher is required to prevent it. <a href="Third%20base">Third base</a> is a shorter throw for the catcher, but the runner is able to take a longer lead off second base. A steal of <a href="home%20plate">home plate</a> is the riskiest, as the catcher only needs to tag out the runner after receiving the ball from the pitcher. It is difficult for the runner to cover the distance between the bases before the ball arrives home. <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> holds the records for most steals of home in a single season (8) as well as for a career (54). Steals of home are not officially recorded statistics, and must be researched through individual game accounts. Thus, Cobb's totals may be even greater than is recorded. <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> famously stole home in Game 1 of the <a href="1955%20World%20Series">1955 World Series</a>. 35 games have ended with a runner stealing home, but only 2 have occurred since 1980. In a variation on the steal of home, the batter is signaled to simultaneously execute a <a href="sacrifice%20bunt">sacrifice bunt</a>, which results in the "<a href="Squeeze%20play%20%28baseball%29">squeeze play</a>." The "suicide squeeze" is a squeeze in which the runner on third begins to steal home without seeing the outcome of the bunt; it is so named because if the batter fails to bunt, the runner will surely be out. In contrast, when the runner on third does not commit until seeing that the ball is bunted advantageously, it is called a "safety squeeze."

In more recent years, most steals of home involve a "delayed double steal", in which a runner on first attempts to steal second, while the runner on third breaks for home as soon as the catcher throws to second base. If it is important to prevent the run from scoring, the catcher may hold on to the ball (conceding the steal of second) or may throw to the pitcher; this may deceive the runner at third and the pitcher may throw back to the catcher for the out.

In <a href="baseball%20statistics">baseball statistics</a>, stolen bases are denoted by SB. Attempts to steal that result in the baserunner being out are "<a href="caught%20stealing">caught stealing</a>" (CS). The sum of these statistics is "steal attempts."

The rule on stolen bases states that:

Relative skill at stealing bases can be judged either by evaluating a player's total number of steals or the success rate (stolen bases as a percentage of steal attempts). Noted statistician <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> has argued that unless a player can steal a high percentage of the time, then the stolen base may be detrimental to a team. A success rate of 67 to 70% or better is necessary to make stealing bases worthwhile.

Comparing skill against players from other eras is also problematic because the definition has not been constant. Caught stealing was not recorded regularly until the middle of the 20th century. <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, for example, was known as a great base-stealer, with 892 steals and a success rate of over 83%. However the data on Cobb's caught stealing is missing from 12 seasons, strongly suggesting he was unsuccessful many more times than his stats indicate. <a href="Carlos%20Beltr%C3%A1n">Carlos Beltrán</a>, with 286 steals, has the highest career success rate of all players with over 300 stolen base attempts, at 88.3%.

The first mention of the stolen base as a statistic was in the 1877 scoring rules adopted by the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>, which noted credit toward a player's <a href="total%20bases">total bases</a> when a base is stolen. It was not until 1886 that the stolen base appeared as something to be tracked, but was only to "appear in the summary of the game".

In 1887, the stolen base was given its own individual statistical column in the <a href="box%20score">box score</a>, and was defined for purposes of scoring: "...every base made after first base has been reached by a base runner, except for those made by reason of or with the aid of a battery error (<a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a> or <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a>), or by batting, <a href="balk">balk</a>s or by being forced off. In short, shall include all bases made by a clean steal, or through a wild throw or muff of the ball by a fielder who is directly trying to put the base runner out while attempting to steal." The next year, it was clarified that any attempt to steal must be credited to the runner, and that fielders committing errors during this play must also be charged with an error. This rule also clarified that advancement of another base(s) beyond the one being stolen is not credited as a stolen base on the same play, and that an error is charged to the fielder who permitted the extra advancement. There was clarification that a runner is credited with a steal if the attempt began before a battery error. Finally, batters were credited with a stolen base if they were tagged out after over running the base.

In 1892, a rule credited runners with stolen bases if a base runner advanced on a fly out, or if they advanced more than one base on any safe hit or attempted out, providing an attempt was made by the defense to put the runner out. The rule was rescinded in 1897.

In 1898, stolen base scoring was narrowed to no longer include advancement in the event of a fielding error, or advancement caused by a hit batsman.

1904 saw an attempt to reduce the already wordy slew of rules governing stolen bases, with the stolen base now credited when "...the advances a base unaided by a base hit, a put out, (or) a fielding or batter error."

1910 saw the first addressing of the double and triple steal attempts. Under the new rule, when any runner is thrown out, and the other(s) are successful, the successful runners will not be credited with a stolen base.

Without using the term, 1920 saw the first rule that would be referred to today as defensive indifference, as stolen bases would not be credited, unless an effort was made to stop the runner by the defense. This is usually called if such is attempted in the ninth inning while that player's team is trailing, unless the runner represents the potential tying run.

1931 saw a further narrowing of the criteria for awarding a stolen base. Power was given to the official scorer, in the event of a muff by the catcher in throwing, that in the judgment of the scorer the runner would have been out, to credit the catcher with an error, and not credit the runner with a stolen base. Further, any successful steal on a play resulting in a wild pitch, passed ball, or balk would no longer be credited as a steal, even if the runner had started to steal before the play.

One of the largest rewrites to the rules in history came in 1950. The stolen base was specifically to be credited "to a runner whenever he advances one base unaided by a base hit, a putout, a forceout, a <a href="fielder%27s%20choice">fielder's choice</a>, a passed ball, a wild pitch, or a balk."

There were noted exceptions, such as denying a stolen base to an otherwise successful steal as a part of a double or triple steal, if one other runner was thrown out in the process. A stolen base would be awarded to runners who successfully stole second base as a part of a double steal with a man on third, if the other runner failed to steal home, but instead was able to return safely to third base. Runners who are tagged out oversliding the base after an otherwise successful steal would not be credited with a stolen base. Indifference was also credited as an exception. Runners would now be credited with stolen bases if they had begun the act of stealing, and the resulting pitch was wild, or a passed ball. Finally, for 1950 only, runners would be credited with a stolen base if they were "well advanced" toward the base they were attempting to steal", and the pitcher is charged with a balk, with the further exception of a player attempting to steal, who would otherwise have been forced to advance on the balk by a runner behind them. This rule was removed in 1951.

A clarification came in 1955 that awarded a stolen base to a runner even if he became involved in a <a href="rundown">rundown</a>, provided he evaded the rundown and advanced to the base he intended to steal.

The criteria for "caught stealing" were fine-tuned in 1979, with a runner being charged with being caught if he is put out while trying to steal, overslides a base (otherwise successfully stolen), or is picked off a base and tries to advance to the next base. It is explicitly not caught stealing to be put out after a wild pitch or passed ball.

While not recorded as a stolen base, the same dynamic between batter/runner and defense is on display in the case of an <a href="uncaught%20third%20strike">uncaught third strike</a>. The batter/runner can avoid an <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">out</a> and become a baserunner by reaching first base ahead of the throw. This case is a <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a> that is not an out; the batter/runner's acquisition of first base is scored as a <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a>, a <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a>, or an <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">error</a>. 

In baseball's earlier decades, a runner on second base could "steal" first base, perhaps with the intention of drawing a throw that might allow a runner on third to score (a tactic famously employed by <a href="Germany%20Schaefer">Germany Schaefer</a>). However, such a tactic was not recorded as a stolen base. MLB rules now forbid running clockwise on the basepaths to "confuse the defense or make a travesty of the game". Further, after the pitcher assumes the pitching position, runners cannot return to any previous base.

In a game on April 19, 2013, <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> shortstop <a href="Jean%20Segura">Jean Segura</a> stole second base in the bottom of the eighth inning. After the batter up, <a href="Ryan%20Braun">Ryan Braun</a>, walked, Segura broke early for third base and the pitcher, <a href="Shawn%20Camp">Shawn Camp</a> of the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, threw ahead of him. As Segura was chased back to second base, Braun advanced to second as well and was tagged out. Segura, thinking "he" was out, began to return to the home dugout behind first base, but first base coach <a href="Garth%20Iorg">Garth Iorg</a> directed him to stand at first. Segura had not intentionally run the bases backwards as a deception or mockery, but no fielder tried to tag him out. Later in the inning, he attempted to steal second for the second time, but was thrown out by catcher <a href="Welington%20Castillo">Welington Castillo</a>.

The expression "You can't steal <a href="first%20base">first base</a>" is sometimes used in reference to a player who is fast but not very good at getting <a href="on-base%20percentage">on base</a> in the first place. Former <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> and <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> manager <a href="Lloyd%20McClendon">Lloyd McClendon</a> is jokingly referred to as having "stolen first" in a June 26, 2001 game – after being <a href="ejection%20%28sports%29">ejected</a> for disputing a call at first base, he yanked the base out of the ground and left the field with it, delaying the game.

Plate appearance

In <a href="baseball%20statistics">baseball statistics</a>, a player is credited with a plate appearance (denoted by PA) each time he completes a turn batting. A player completes a turn batting when: he <a href="strikeout">strikes out</a> or is declared <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">out</a> before reaching first base; or he reaches first base <a href="safe%20%28baseball%29">safely</a> or is awarded first base (by a <a href="base%20on%20balls">base on balls</a>, <a href="hit%20by%20pitch">hit by pitch</a>, or <a href="catcher%27s%20interference">catcher's interference</a>); or he hits a <a href="fair%20ball">fair ball</a> which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely ("see also" <a href="left%20on%20base">left on base</a>, <a href="fielder%27s%20choice">fielder's choice</a>, <a href="force%20play">force play</a>). In other words, a plate appearance ends when the batter is put out or becomes a runner. A very similar statistic, <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s, counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances.

While at bats are used to calculate such important player hitting statistics as <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>s, <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a>s and <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a>s, plate appearances have no such statistical value. However, at season's end. a player must have accumulated 502 plate appearances during a season to be ranked in any of these categories. For example, suppose Player A, with 510 plate appearances and 400 at bats, gets 100 hits during the season and finishes with a .250 batting average. And suppose Player B, with 490 plate appearances and 400 at bats, gets 110 hits during the season and finishes the season with a .275 batting average. Player B, even though he had the same amount of at bats as Player A and even though his batting average is higher, will not be eligible for season-ending rankings because he did not accumulate the required 502 plate appearances, while Player A did and therefore will be eligible.

Rule 10.22(a) of the <a href="Official%20Baseball%20Rules">Official Baseball Rules</a> make a single allowance to the minimum requirement of 502 plate appearances. If a player has less than that minimum amount, but if that player would win the batting, slugging or on-base percentage title if he had that minimum amount, then the amount of at bats he is short may be added to his at bat (and hence plate appearance) total so that he may win that title (assuming that his batting average, which would have to be recalculated after these extra at bats were added, would still be the best in his respective league.) For example, in 2012, <a href="Melky%20Cabrera">Melky Cabrera</a>, then of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>, finished the season with a league-high .346 batting average, but he had only 501 plate appearances, one short of the required 502. Per the rule, an extra at bat should have been added to his total because, after it is added and his batting average recalculated, he still would have won the batting title. Melky's case, however, turned out differently. The reason Melky finished the season with only 501 at bats was because he was suspended in mid-August when he tested positive for illegal <a href="performance-enhancing%20drugs">performance-enhancing drugs</a>. Melky was still eligible for that extra plate appearance, but he requested that that extra plate appearance not be added to his total, and that he not be considered for the batting crown, because he admitted that his use of performance-enhancing drugs had given him an unfair advantage over other players. As a result, Melky's name is nowhere to be found on the list of 2012 National League batting leaders.

A batter is not charged with a plate appearance if, while batting, a preceding runner is put out on the basepaths for the third out in a way other than by the batter putting the ball into play (i.e., <a href="pickoff">picked off</a>, <a href="caught%20stealing">caught stealing</a>). In this case, the same batter continues his turn batting in the next inning with no <a href="Balls%20and%20strikes%20%28baseball%29">balls</a> or <a href="strike%20%28baseball%29">strikes</a> against him.

A batter is not charged with a plate appearance if, while batting, the game ends as the winning run scores from third base on a <a href="balk">balk</a>, <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>, <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a> or <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a>.

A batter may or may not be charged with a plate appearance (and possibly at-bat) in the rare instance when he is replaced by a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> after having already started his turn at bat. In this case, the pinch hitter would receive the plate appearance (and potential of an at-bat) unless the original batter is replaced when having 2 strikes against him and the pinch hitter subsequently completes the strikeout. In this case the plate appearance and at-bat are charged to the first batter. (see <a href="http%3A//mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp">rule 10.15b</a>)

In common terminology, the term "at bat" is sometimes used to mean "plate appearance" (for example, "he fouled off the ball to keep the "at bat" alive"). The intent is usually clear from the context, although the term "official at bat" is sometimes used to explicitly refer to an "at bat" as distinguished from a "plate appearance". However, terms such as "turn at bat" or "time at bat" are synonymous with "plate appearance".

Section 10 of the official rules states that an at bat is not counted when the player:

The main use of the plate appearance statistic is in determining a player's eligibility for leadership in some offensive statistical categories, notably <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>; currently, a player must have 3.1 PAs per game scheduled to qualify for the batting title (for the 162-game schedule, that means 502 PAs). Also, it is often erroneously cited that total plate appearances is the divisor (i.e., denominator) used in calculating <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> (OBP), an alternative measurement of a player's offensive performance; in reality, the OBP denominator does "not" include certain PAs, such as times reached via either catcher’s interference or fielder’s obstruction or Sacrifice Hits (Sacrifice Flies are included).

Plate appearances are also used by scorers for "proving" a box score. If the game has been scored correctly, the total number of plate appearances for a team should equal the total of that team's <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a>, men <a href="left%20on%20base">left on base</a>, and men put <a href="Out%20%28baseball%29">out</a>.

<doc id="3817" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3817" title="Boogie Down Productions">
Boogie Down Productions

Boogie Down Productions was a <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> group, originally composed of <a href="KRS-One">KRS-One</a>, <a href="D-Nice">D-Nice</a>, and DJ <a href="Scott%20La%20Rock">Scott La Rock</a>. DJ Scott La Rock was murdered on August 27, 1987, five months after the release of BDP's debut album, "<a href="Criminal%20Minded">Criminal Minded</a>". The name of the group, Boogie Down, derives from a nickname for the <a href="South%20Bronx">South Bronx</a> section of <a href="The%20Bronx">The Bronx</a>, one of the five boroughs of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The group pioneered the fusion of <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> reggae and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a> and their debut LP "Criminal Minded" contained frank descriptions of life in the South Bronx during the late 1980s, thus setting the stage for what would eventually become <a href="gangsta%20rap">gangsta rap</a>.

The membership of BDP changed continuously throughout its existence, the only constant being <a href="KRS-One">KRS-One</a>. The group was founded by KRS-One and DJ Scott La Rock, with producer Lee Smith, who was essential in the production of the songs in the group's first album "Criminal Minded", being added as a member shortly after. From those beginnings, BDP members and collaborators included Lee Smith, <a href="Scott%20La%20Rock">Scott La Rock</a>, <a href="D-Nice">D-Nice</a>, Kenny Parker (younger brother of KRS-One), <a href="Mad%20Lion">Mad Lion</a>, DJ Premier, Just-Ice, ICU <a href="Channel%20Live">Channel Live</a>, McBoo, <a href="Ms.%20Melodie">Ms. Melodie</a>, <a href="Heather%20B.">Heather B.</a>, Scottie Morris, Tony Rahsan, Willie D., RoboCop, Harmony, <a href="DJ%20Red%20Alert">DJ Red Alert</a>, Jay Kramer, D-Square, Rebekah Foster, Scott Whitehill, Scott King, Chris Tait and Sidney Mills. BDP as a group essentially ended because KRS-One began recording and performing under his own name rather than the group name. Original member Lee Smith, who has co-producer credit on the original 12” "South Bronx" single, was the last to be inexplicably jettisoned by KRS-One and the future new label after Scott’s death.

In the liner notes on BDP's 1992 album "Sex and Violence", KRS-One writes: "BDP in 1992 is KRS-One, Willie D, and Kenny Parker! BDP is not D-Nice, Jamal-ski, Harmony, Ms. Melodie, and Scottie Morris. They are not down with BDP so stop frontin'." Steve "Flash" Juon of RapReviews.com claimed that this initiated the ultimate breakup of the group. See Also: <a href="KRS-One">KRS-One</a>, <a href="Scott%20La%20Rock">Scott La Rock</a>, and <a href="D-Nice">D-Nice</a>

“The Bridge Wars”

A conflict arose in the late 80s about the origins of hip-hop, and BDP made conscious efforts in its early work to establish their interpretation of the issue. The origins of hip-hop to many, including BDP, are believed to be from <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>. A rival <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip-hop</a> collective known as the <a href="Juice%20Crew">Juice Crew</a>'s lyrics were misunderstood to contain a claim in the song "The Bridge" that hip hop was directly a result of artists originating from <a href="Queensbridge%2C%20Queens">Queensbridge</a>. Boogie Down and KRS retorted angrily with songs such as “The Bridge is Over” and “South Bronx,” which started one of the first notable hip hop wars as <a href="MC%20Shan">MC Shan</a>, <a href="Marley%20Marl">Marley Marl</a>, <a href="Roxanne%20Shant%C3%A9">Roxanne Shanté</a> and <a href="Blaq%20Poet">Blaq Poet</a> all released songs featuring verses personally attacking KRS and Scott La Rock. The Bridge Wars, however, were only short-lived, and after the death of Scott La Rock prior to the group's second album, KRS began to concentrate on consciously focused music.

While "Criminal Minded" contained vivid descriptions of South Bronx street life, BDP changed after Scott's death. Producer Lee Smith was dropped and KRS-One adopted the Teacha moniker and made a deliberate attempt at creating politically and socially conscious Hip-Hop. BDP was hugely influential in provoking political and social consciousness in Hip-Hop however the group was sometimes overshadowed by the political hip hop group <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28band%29">Public Enemy</a>.

Jamaican inspirations

The Jamaican influence present in "Criminal Minded" is well illustrated by the use of the "Mad Mad" or "Diseases" <a href="riddim">riddim</a> started in 1981 with reggae star <a href="Yellowman">Yellowman</a>'s song "Zunguzung." BDP used this riff in the song "Remix for P is Free," and it was later resampled by artists such as <a href="Black%20Star%20%28group%29">Black Star</a> and <a href="dead%20prez">dead prez</a>. As an album regarded by many as the start of the <a href="gangsta%20rap">gangsta rap</a> movement, "Criminal Minded" played an important role in reaffirming the social acceptance of having Jamaican roots. BDP referenced reggae in a way that helped to solidify Jamaica's place in modern hip-hop culture.

From its start, BDP was impactful in both the development of hip-hop and giving a sincere voice to the reality of life in the South Bronx, a section of New York City that is clouded with poverty and crime. With its debut album "Criminal Minded", this early hip-hop group combined the sounds of LaRock's harsh, spare, reggae-influenced beats and KRS-One's long-winded rhyme style on underground classics such as “9mm Goes Bang” and “South Bronx,” the album's gritty portrait of life on the streets (as well as the firearms that adorned its cover) influenced the <a href="gangsta%20rap">gangsta rap</a> movement that began in earnest two years later.

The influence of BDP in the creation and development of gangsta rap highlights the cultural significance and impact of the type of music BDP and other early hip-hop artists like it created. This subgenre of hip-hop is most closely associated with hard-core hip-hop and is widely misinterpreted as promoting violence and gang activity. This misinterpretation or stigma is closely related to Boogie Down Productions and the general purpose behind their underlying themes of violence. For instance, the cover art of "Criminal Minded" displays the two artists in this group brandishing drawn guns and displaying other firearms. This is not an encouragement of the violence described in BDP’s music, but rather a portrayal or hinting at the violence present in the South Bronx as a means of expression, escape, and even condemnation. This album art is not meant to advocate for violence but to challenge the conception of a criminal, to assert that those who are really criminally minded are those who hold power. This conflicts with the general stigma surrounding gangsta rap, which thrives off of displaying messages of violence in such a way that it doesn’t challenge these social ills, but rather supports them through the culture of the music.

The music of BDP became significantly more politically astute after the death of disc jockey Scott La Rock, KRS-One’s mentor and partner. La Rock’s death symbolized all of the injustices that BDP reacted to and lyrically described in their music, and thus inspired KRS-One, now the only original member left in the group, to become more passionate about the relevance of the message of BDP’s music. He went on to publish four more albums under the title of Boogie Down Productions, and each one was increasingly innovative and expanded from the thuggish imagery of "Criminal Minded" and began to explore themes like black-on-black crime, and black radicalism, using a riff on the words of <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>, “by any means necessary”, which became the title of the second BDP album, and still remains as one of the most political hip-hop albums to date. It was in this album where KRS defined himself as the “teacha” or “teacher” symbolizing his emphasis on educating his audience members and fans about relevant social issues surrounding the African-American experience.

During his time in association with Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One joined with other rappers to create the <a href="Stop%20the%20Violence%20Movement">Stop the Violence Movement</a>, which addressed many of the issues brought about through BDP’s music and is the most conscious effort displayed by KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions of political Activism and engagement. The movement created the single “Self-Destruction” in 1989 through the collaboration of hip-hop artists Boogie Down Productions (KRS-One, D-Nice & Ms. Melodie), <a href="Stetsasonic">Stetsasonic</a> (Delite, Daddy-O, <a href="Wise%20%28rapper%29">Wise</a>, and <a href="Frukwan">Frukwan</a>), <a href="Kool%20Moe%20Dee">Kool Moe Dee</a>, <a href="MC%20Lyte">MC Lyte</a>, <a href="Doug%20E.%20Fresh">Doug E. Fresh</a>, <a href="Just-Ice">Just-Ice</a>, <a href="Heavy%20D">Heavy D</a>, <a href="Biz%20Markie">Biz Markie</a>, <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28group%29">Public Enemy</a> (<a href="Chuck%20D">Chuck D</a> & <a href="Flavor%20Flav">Flavor Flav</a>) with the aim of spreading awareness about violence throughout African-American and hip-hop communities. All proceeds from this effort went to the <a href="National%20Urban%20League">National Urban League</a>.

Binary-coded decimal

In <a href="computing">computing</a> and <a href="electronics">electronic</a> systems, binary-coded decimal (BCD) is a class of <a href="Binary%20numeral%20system">binary</a> encodings of <a href="decimal">decimal</a> numbers where each decimal <a href="numerical%20digit">digit</a> is represented by a fixed number of <a href="bit">bit</a>s, usually four or eight. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a <a href="Sign%20%28mathematics%29">sign</a> or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow).

In byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term "unpacked" BCD usually implies a full <a href="byte">byte</a> for each digit (often including a sign), whereas "packed" BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see <a href="Excess-3">Excess-3</a> for instance. The ten states representing a BCD decimal digit are sometimes called "tetrades" (for the <a href="nibble">nibble</a> typically needed to hold them also known as <a href="tetrade%20%28computing%29">tetrade</a>) with those <a href="don%27t%20care">don't care</a>-states unused named or "pseudo-decimal digit").

BCD's main virtue is its more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities as well as an ease of conversion into human-readable representations, in comparison to binary <a href="positional%20system">positional system</a>s. BCD's principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetics and a slightly less dense storage.

BCD was used in many early <a href="decimal%20computer">decimal computer</a>s, and is implemented in the instruction set of machines such as the <a href="IBM%20System/360">IBM System/360</a> series and its descendants, <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>'s <a href="VAX">VAX</a> and the Motorola <a href="68000">68000</a>-series processors. Although BCD "per se" is not as widely used as in the past and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as ARM; x86 does not support <a href="Intel%20BCD%20opcode">BCD instruction</a>s in <a href="long%20mode">long mode</a> any more) decimal <a href="Fixed-point%20arithmetic">fixed-point</a> and <a href="floating-point">floating-point</a> formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and <a href="fraction%20%28mathematics%29">fractional</a> <a href="rounding">rounding</a> <a href="round-off%20error">errors</a> that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.

BCD takes advantage of the fact that any one decimal numeral can be represented by a four bit pattern. The most obvious way of encoding digits is "natural BCD" (NBCD), where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary value, as shown in the following table. This is also called "8421" encoding.
Other encodings are also used, including so-called "4221" and "7421" — named after the weighting used for the bits — and "<a href="excess-3">excess-3</a>". For example, the BCD digit 6, '0110'b in 8421 notation, is '1100'b in 4221 (two encodings are possible), '0110'b in 7421, and '1001'b (6+3=9) in excess-3.

As most computers deal with data in 8-bit <a href="byte">byte</a>s, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:


As an example, encoding the decimal number 91 using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes:

In packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte:

Hence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.

To represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used.  For example, to represent the decimal number 12345 in packed BCD, using <a href="big-endian">big-endian</a> format, a program would encode as follows:

Note that the most significant nibble of the most significant byte is zero, implying that the number is in actuality 012345.  Also note how packed BCD is more efficient in storage usage as compared to unpacked BCD; encoding the same number (with the leading zero) in unpacked format would consume twice the storage.

<a href="logical%20shift">Shifting</a> and <a href="mask%20%28computing%29">masking</a> operations are used to pack or unpack a packed BCD digit.  Other <a href="bitwise%20operation">logical operation</a>s are used to convert a numeral to its equivalent bit pattern or reverse the process.

BCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical <a href="seven-segment%20display">seven-segment display</a>s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary. Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD.

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.

In Packed BCD (or simply packed decimal), each of the two <a href="nibble">nibble</a>s of each byte represent a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM mainframe hardware since then. Most implementations are <a href="big%20endian">big endian</a>, i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.

Standard sign values are 1100 (<a href="hexadecimal">hex</a> C) for positive (+) and 1101 (D) for negative (−). This convention comes from the zone field for <a href="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a> characters and the <a href="signed%20overpunch">signed overpunch</a> representation. Other allowed signs are 1010 (A) and 1110 (E) for positive and 1011 (B) for negative. IBM System/360 processors will use the 1010 (A) and 1011 (B) signs if the A bit is set in the PSW, for the ASCII-8 standard that never passed. Most implementations also provide unsigned BCD values with a sign nibble of 1111 (F). ILE RPG uses 1111 (F) for positive and 1101 (D) for negative. These match the EBCDIC zone for digits without a sign overpunch. In packed BCD, the number 127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1100 (127C) and −127 is represented by 0001 0010 0111 1101 (127D). Burroughs systems used 1101 (D) for negative, and any other value is considered a positive sign value (the processors will normalize a positive sign to 1100 (C)).

No matter how many bytes wide a <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">word</a> is, there are always an even number of nibbles because each byte has two of them. Therefore, a word of "n" bytes can contain up to (2"n")−1 decimal digits, which is always an odd number of digits. A decimal number with "d" digits requires ½("d"+1) bytes of storage space.

For example, a 4-byte (32-bit) word can hold seven decimal digits plus a sign, and can represent values ranging from ±9,999,999. Thus the number −1,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as:

In contrast, a 4-byte binary <a href="two%27s%20complement">two's complement</a> integer can represent values from −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.

While packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (about / of the memory used is wasted), conversion to <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a>, <a href="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>, or the various encodings of <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required. The extra storage requirements are usually offset by the need for the accuracy and compatibility with calculator or hand calculation that fixed-point decimal arithmetic provides. Denser packings of <a href="BCD%20%28character%20encoding%29">BCD</a> exist which avoid the storage penalty and also need no arithmetic operations for common conversions.

Packed BCD is supported in the <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> programming language as the "COMPUTATIONAL-3" (an IBM extension adopted by many other compiler vendors) or "PACKED-DECIMAL" (part of the 1985 COBOL standard) data type. It is supported in <a href="PL/I">PL/I</a> as "FIXED DECIMAL". Besides the IBM System/360 and later compatible mainframes, packed BCD is implemented in the native instruction set of the original <a href="VAX">VAX</a> processors from <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> and some models of the <a href="SDS%20Sigma%20series">SDS Sigma series</a> mainframes, and is the native format for the <a href="Burroughs%20Corporation">Burroughs Corporation</a> Medium Systems line of mainframes (descended from the 1950s Electrodata 200 series).

<a href="Ten%27s%20complement">Ten's complement</a> representations for negative numbers offer an alternative approach to encoding the sign of packed (and other) BCD numbers. In this case, positive numbers always have a most significant digit between 0 and 4 (inclusive), while negative numbers are represented by the 10's complement of the corresponding positive number. As a result, this system allows for, a 32-bit packed BCD numbers to range from -50,000,000 to 49,999,999, and -1 is represented as 99999999. (As with <a href="two%27s%20complement">two's complement</a> binary numbers, the range is not symmetric about zero.)

<a href="Fixed-point%20arithmetic">Fixed-point</a> decimal numbers are supported by some programming languages (such as <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> and <a href="PL/I">PL/I</a>). These languages allow the programmer to specify an implicit decimal point in front of one of the digits. For example, a packed decimal value encoded with the bytes 12 34 56 7C represents the fixed-point value +1,234.567 when the implied decimal point is located between the 4th and 5th digits:

The decimal point is not actually stored in memory, as the packed BCD storage format does not provide for it. Its location is simply known to the compiler and the generated code acts accordingly for the various arithmetic operations.

If a decimal digit requires four bits, then three decimal digits require 12 bits. However, since 2 (1,024) is greater than 10 (1,000), if three decimal digits are encoded together, only 10 bits are needed. Two such encodings are "<a href="Chen-Ho%20encoding">Chen-Ho encoding</a>" and "<a href="Densely%20Packed%20Decimal">Densely Packed Decimal</a>" (DPD). The latter has the advantage that subsets of the encoding encode two digits in the optimal seven bits and one digit in four bits, as in regular BCD.

Some implementations, for example <a href="IBM">IBM</a> mainframe systems, support zoned decimal numeric representations. Each decimal digit is stored in one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the "zone" bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the <a href="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a> codes for the characters "0" through "9". Similarly, <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> systems use a zone value of 0011 (hex 3), giving character codes 30 to 39 (hex).

For signed zoned decimal values, the rightmost (least significant) zone nibble holds the sign digit, which is the same set of values that are used for signed packed decimal numbers (see above). Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value −123:

(*) "Note: These characters vary depending on the local character <a href="code%20page">code page</a> setting."

Some languages (such as <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> and <a href="PL/I">PL/I</a>) directly support fixed-point zoned decimal values, assigning an implicit decimal point at some location between the decimal digits of a number. For example, given a six-byte signed zoned decimal value with an implied decimal point to the right of the fourth digit, the hex bytes F1 F2 F7 F9 F5 C0 represent the value +1,279.50:

<a href="IBM">IBM</a> used the terms "<a href="Binary-Coded%20Decimal%20Interchange%20Code">Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code</a>" (BCDIC, sometimes just called BCD), for 6-bit "<a href="alphanumeric">alphanumeric</a>" codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC "alphamerics" is used in most early IBM computers, including the <a href="IBM%201620">IBM 1620</a>, <a href="IBM%201400%20series">IBM 1400 series</a>, and non-<a href="IBM%20700/7000%20series%23Decimal%20architecture%20%287070/7072/7074%29">Decimal Architecture</a> members of the <a href="IBM%20700/7000%20series">IBM 700/7000 series</a>.

The <a href="IBM%201400%20series">IBM 1400 series</a> are character-addressable machines, each location being six bits labeled "B, A, 8, 4, 2" and "1," plus an odd parity check bit ("C") and a word mark bit ("M"). For encoding digits "1" through "9", "B" and "A" are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits "8" through "1". For most other characters bits "B" and "A" are derived simply from the "12", "11", and "0" "zone punches" in the punched card character code, and bits "8" through "1" from the "1" through "9" punches. A "12 zone" punch set both "B" and "A", an "11 zone" set "B", and a "0 zone" (a 0 punch combined with any others) set "A". Thus the letter A, which is "(12,1)" in the punched card format, is encoded "(B,A,1)". The currency symbol $, "(11,8,3)" in the punched card, was encoded in memory as "(B,8,2,1)". This allowed the circuitry to convert between the punched card format and the internal storage format to be very simple with only a few special cases. One important special case is digit "0", represented by a lone "0" punch in the card, and "(8,2)" in core memory.

The memory of the <a href="IBM%201620">IBM 1620</a> is organized into 6-bit addressable digits, the usual "8, 4, 2, 1" plus "F", used as a flag bit and "C", an odd parity check bit. BCD "alphamerics" are encoded using digit pairs, with the "zone" in the even-addressed digit and the "digit" in the odd-addressed digit, the "zone" being related to the "12", "11", and "0" "zone punches" as in the 1400 series. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

In the Decimal Architecture <a href="IBM%207070">IBM 7070</a>, <a href="IBM%207072">IBM 7072</a>, and <a href="IBM%207074">IBM 7074</a> "alphamerics" are encoded using digit pairs (using <a href="two-out-of-five%20code">two-out-of-five code</a> in the digits, not BCD) of the 10-digit word, with the "zone" in the left digit and the "digit" in the right digit. Input/Output translation hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.

With the introduction of <a href="System/360">System/360</a>, IBM expanded 6-bit BCD "alphamerics" to 8-bit <a href="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>, allowing the addition of many more characters (e.g., lowercase letters). A variable length Packed BCD "numeric" data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.

On the <a href="IBM%201130">IBM 1130</a> and <a href="IBM%201800">1800</a>, packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.

Today, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as <a href="IBM%20DB2">IBM DB2</a>, mainframes, and <a href="Power6">Power6</a>. In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per <a href="byte">byte</a>), or "pure" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte). All of these are used within hardware registers and processing units, and in software. To convert packed decimals in EBCDIC table unloads to readable numbers, you can use the OUTREC FIELDS mask of the <a href="JCL">JCL</a> utility DFSORT.

The <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> <a href="VAX">VAX-11</a> series includes <a href="Instruction%20set">instructions</a> that can perform arithmetic directly on packed BCD data and convert between packed BCD data and other integer representations. The VAX's packed BCD format is compatible with that on IBM System/360 and IBM's later compatible processors. The MicroVAX and later VAX implementations dropped this ability from the CPU but retained code compatibility with earlier machines by implementing the missing instructions in an operating system-supplied software library. This is invoked automatically via exception handling when the no longer implemented instructions are encountered, so that programs using them can execute without modification on the newer machines.

The <a href="Intel">Intel</a> <a href="x86">x86</a> architecture supports a unique 18-digit (ten-byte) BCD format that can be loaded into and stored from the floating point registers, and computations can be performed there.

The <a href="Motorola%2068000%20series">Motorola 68000 series</a> had BCD instructions.

In more recent computers such capabilities are almost always implemented in software rather than the CPU's instruction set, but BCD numeric data is still extremely common in commercial and financial applications. There are tricks for implementing packed BCD and zoned decimal add or subtract operations using short but difficult to understand sequences of word-parallel logic and binary arithmetic operations. For example, the following code (written in <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>) computes an unsigned 8-digit packed BCD add using 32-bit binary operations:

It is possible to perform <a href="addition">addition</a> in BCD by first adding in binary, and then converting to BCD afterwards. Conversion of the simple sum of two digits can be done by adding 6 (that is, 16 – 10) when the five-bit result of adding a pair of digits has a value greater than 9. For example:

Note that 10001 is the binary, not decimal, representation of the desired result. Also note that it cannot fit in a 4-bit number. 
In BCD as in decimal, there cannot exist a value greater than 9 (1001) per digit. 
To correct this, 6 (0110) is added to that sum and then the result is treated as two 
<a href="nibble">nibble</a>s:

The two nibbles of the result, 0001 and 0111, correspond to the digits "1" and "7". This yields "17" in BCD, which is the correct result.

This technique can be extended to adding multiple digits by adding in groups from right to left, propagating the second digit as a carry, always comparing the 5-bit result of each digit-pair sum to 9. Some CPUs provide a <a href="half-carry%20flag">half-carry flag</a> to facilitate BCD arithmetic adjustments following binary addition and subtraction operations.

Subtraction is done by adding the <a href="ten%27s%20complement">ten's complement</a> of the <a href="subtrahend">subtrahend</a>. To represent the sign of a number in BCD, the number 0000 is used to represent a <a href="positive%20number">positive number</a>, and 1001 is used to represent a <a href="negative%20number">negative number</a>. The remaining 14 combinations are invalid signs. To illustrate signed BCD subtraction, consider the following problem: 357 − 432.

In signed BCD, 357 is 0000 0011 0101 0111. The <a href="ten%27s%20complement">ten's complement</a> of 432 can be obtained by taking the <a href="nine%27s%20complement">nine's complement</a> of 432, and then adding one. So, 999 − 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number −432 can be represented. So, −432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.

Now that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:

Since BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid. In the event that an invalid entry (any BCD digit greater than 1001) exists, 6 is added to generate a carry bit and cause the sum to become a valid entry. The reason for adding 6 is that there are 16 possible 4-bit BCD values (since 2 = 16), but only 10 values are valid (0000 through 1001). So adding 6 to the invalid entries results in the following:

Thus the result of the subtraction is 1001 1001 0010 0101 (-925). To check the answer, note that the first digit is 9, which means negative. This seems to be correct, since 357 − 432 should result in a negative number. To check the rest of the digits, represent them in decimal. 1001 0010 0101 is 925. The <a href="ten%27s%20complement">ten's complement</a> of 925 is 1000 − 925 = 999 − 925 + 1 = 074 + 1 = 75, so the calculated answer is −75. To check, perform standard subtraction to verify that 357 − 432 is −75.

Note that in the event that there are a different number of nibbles being added together (such as 1053 − 122), the number with the fewest number of digits must first be padded with zeros before taking the <a href="ten%27s%20complement">ten's complement</a> or subtracting. So, with 1053 − 122, 122 would have to first be represented as 0122, and the <a href="ten%27s%20complement">ten's complement</a> of 0122 would have to be calculated.

The binary-coded decimal scheme described in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others. The method here can be referred to as "Simple Binary-Coded Decimal" ("SBCD") or "BCD 8421".

In the headers to the table, the ", indicates the weight of each bit shown; note that in the fifth column, "BCD 8 4 −2 −1", two of the weights are negative. Both ASCII and EBCDIC character codes for the digits are examples of zoned BCD, and are also shown in the table.

The following table represents <a href="decimal">decimal</a> digits from 0 to 9 in various BCD systems:

In the 1972 case <a href="Gottschalk%20v.%20Benson">Gottschalk v. Benson</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision which had allowed a patent for converting BCD encoded numbers to binary on a computer. This was an important case in determining the patentability of software and algorithms.



The <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a> in many <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s stores the date and time in BCD because the <a href="MC6818">MC6818</a> real-time clock chip used in the original <a href="IBM%20PC%20AT">IBM PC AT</a> motherboard provided the time encoded in BCD. This form is easily converted into ASCII for display.

The <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a> of computers used BCD to implement floating-point algorithms. The <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">MOS 6502</a> processor has a BCD mode that affects the addition and subtraction instructions. The <a href="Psion%20Organiser">Psion Organiser 1</a> handheld computer’s manufacturer-supplied software also used entirely BCD to implement floating point; later Psion models used binary exclusively.

Early models of the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> store the date and time in BCD. This led to a worldwide outage of the console on 1 March 2010. The last two digits of the year stored as BCD <a href="time%20formatting%20and%20storage%20bugs">were misinterpreted</a> as 16 causing an error in the unit's date, rendering most functions inoperable. This has been referred to as the <a href="Year%202000%20problem%23Year%202010%20problem">Year 2010 Problem</a>.

Various BCD implementations exist that employ other representations for numbers. <a href="Programmable%20calculator">Programmable calculator</a>s manufactured by <a href="Texas%20Instruments">Texas Instruments</a>, <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>, and others typically employ a <a href="floating-point">floating-point</a> BCD format, typically with two or three digits for the (decimal) exponent. The extra bits of the sign digit may be used to indicate special numeric values, such as <a href="infinity">infinity</a>, <a href="arithmetic%20underflow">underflow</a>/<a href="arithmetic%20overflow">overflow</a>, and <a href="Defined%20and%20undefined">error</a> (a blinking display).

Signed decimal values may be represented in several ways. The <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> programming language, for example, supports a total of five zoned decimal formats, each one encoding the numeric sign in a different way:

<a href="3GPP">3GPP</a> developed TBCD, an expansion to BCD where the remaining (unused) bit combinations are used to add specific <a href="telephony">telephony</a> characters, with digits similar to those found in <a href="Dual-tone%20multi-frequency%20signaling">telephone keypads</a> original design. It is <a href="backward%20compatible">backward compatible</a> with BCD.

If errors in representation and computation are more important than the speed of conversion to and from display, a scaled binary representation may be used, which stores a decimal number as a binary-encoded integer and a binary-encoded signed decimal exponent. For example, 0.2 can be represented as 2.

This representation allows rapid multiplication and division, but may require shifting by a power of 10 during addition and subtraction to align the decimal points. It is appropriate for applications with a fixed number of decimal places that do not then require this adjustment— particularly financial applications where 2 or 4 digits after the decimal point are usually enough. Indeed, this is almost a form of <a href="fixed%20point%20arithmetic">fixed point arithmetic</a> since the position of the <a href="radix%20point">radix point</a> is implied.

<a href="Chen-Ho%20encoding">Chen-Ho encoding</a> provides a boolean transformation for converting groups of three BCD-encoded digits to and from 10-bit values that can be efficiently encoded in hardware with only 2 or 3 gate delays. <a href="Densely%20Packed%20Decimal">Densely Packed Decimal</a> is a similar scheme that is used for most of the <a href="significand">significand</a>, except the lead digit, for one of the two alternative decimal encodings specified in the <a href="IEEE%20754-2008">IEEE 754-2008</a> standard.

Bumin Qaghan

Bumin Qaghan (<a href="Old%20Turkic">Old Turkic</a>: , Bumïn qaγan, a.k.a. Bumın Kagan) or Illig Qaghan (<a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>: 伊利可汗, <a href="Pinyin">Pinyin</a>: yīlì kěhàn, <a href="Wade%E2%80%93Giles">Wade–Giles</a>: i-li k'o-han, died 552 AD) was the founder of the <a href="G%C3%B6kt%C3%BCrks">Turkic Khaganate</a>. He was the eldest son of <a href="Ashina%20Tuwu">Ashina Tuwu</a> (吐務 / 吐务). He was the chieftain of the Türks under the sovereignty of <a href="Rouran%20Khaganate">Rouran Khaganate</a>. He is also mentioned as "Tumen" (<a href="wikt%3A%E5%9C%9F">土</a><a href="wikt%3A%E9%96%80">門</a>, 吐門, commander of ten thousand) of the Rouran Khaganate.

According to "<a href="History%20of%20Northern%20Dynasties">History of Northern Dynasties</a>" and "<a href="Zizhi%20Tongjian">Zizhi Tongjian</a>", in 545 Tumen's tribe started to rise and frequently invaded the western frontier of Wei. The <a href="Chancellor%20%28China%29">chancellor</a> of <a href="Western%20Wei">Western Wei</a> <a href="Yuwen%20Tai">Yuwen Tai</a> sent <a href="An%20Nuopanto">An Nuopanto</a> (Nanai-Banda, a <a href="Sogdian%20people">Sogdian</a> from <a href="Bukhara">Bukhara</a>) to Kök Türks to greet its chieftain Tumen to try to establish commercial relationship. In 546, Tumen presented tribute to Western Wei.

And in the same year he put down a revolt of the <a href="Tiele%20people">Tiele tribes</a> against their overlords the <a href="Rouran%20Khaganate">Rouran Khaganate</a>. He took advantage of this success and requested a Rouran princess in marriage. But the qaghan of Rouran <a href="Yujiul%C3%BC%20Anagui">Anagui</a> refused this request and sent to Bumin a mission and message: "You are my blacksmith slave. How dare you utter these words?". Bumin got angry and killed Anagui's mission and cut all relationship with Rouran Khaganate.

Anagui's "blacksmith" (<a href="wikt%3A%E9%8D%9B">鍛</a><a href="wikt%3A%E5%A5%B4">奴</a> / 锻奴, Pinyin: duàn nú, Wade–Giles: tuan-nu) insult was recorded in Chinese chronicles and historians accepted that the Kök Türks were indeed blacksmith servants for the Rouran elite, and that "blacksmith slavery" may indicate a kind of vassalage system prevailed in Rouran society. Nevertheless, after this incident Bumin emerged as the leader of the revolt against Rouran.

In 551, Bumin requested a Western Wei princess in marriage. Yuwen Tai permitted it and sent <a href="Princess%20Changle">Princess Changle</a> of Western Wei to Bumin.　In the same year when <a href="Emperor%20Wen%20of%20Western%20Wei">Emperor Wen of Western Wei</a> died Bumin sent mission and gave two hundred horses.

The beginning of formal diplomatic relations with China propped up Bumin's authority among the Turks. He eventually united the local Turkic tribes and threw off the yoke of the <a href="Rouran">Rouran</a> domination.

In 552 Bumin's army defeated Anagui's forces at the north of <a href="Six%20Frontier%20Towns">Huaihuang</a> and then Anagui committed suicide. With their defeat Bumin proclaimed himself "Illig Qaghan" and made his wife qaghatun.

He was succeeded by his younger brother <a href="Istemi">Istemi</a> in the western part and by his son <a href="Issik%20Qaghan">Issik Qaghan</a> in the eastern part.

Bauhaus

Staatliches Bauhaus (), commonly known simply as Bauhaus, was a <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="art%20school">art school</a> operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicised and taught.

The Bauhaus was founded by <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a> in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>. The German term "<a href="wikt%3ABauhaus%23German">Bauhaus</a>"—literally "construction house"—was understood as meaning "School of Building", but in spite of its name and the fact that its founder was an <a href="architect">architect</a>, the Bauhaus did not have an <a href="architecture">architecture</a> department during its first years of existence. Nonetheless, it was founded with the idea of creating a "total" work of art (<a href="Gesamtkunstwerk">Gesamtkunstwerk</a>) in which all arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, <a href="Modern%20architecture">Modernist architecture</a> and art, design and architectural education. The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, <a href="industrial%20design">industrial design</a>, and <a href="typography">typography</a>.

The school existed in three German cities: <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> from 1919 to 1925, <a href="Dessau">Dessau</a> from 1925 to 1932 and <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a> from 1919 to 1928, <a href="Hannes%20Meyer">Hannes Meyer</a> from 1928 to 1930 and <a href="Ludwig%20Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a> from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.

The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when <a href="Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Mies van der Rohe</a> took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school, and would not allow any supporters of <a href="Hannes%20Meyer">Hannes Meyer</a> to attend it.

Germany's defeat in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the fall of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">German monarchy</a> and the abolition of censorship under the new, liberal <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a> allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, such as <a href="Constructivism%20%28art%29">constructivism</a>. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical. Just as important was the influence of the 19th century English designer <a href="William%20Morris">William Morris</a>, who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function. Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the <a href="International%20Style%20%28architecture%29">International Style</a>, was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.

However, the most important influence on Bauhaus was <a href="modernism">modernism</a>, a cultural movement whose origins lay as early as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus—the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that <a href="mass%20production">mass production</a> was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit—were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers' organization <a href="Deutscher%20Werkbund">Deutscher Werkbund</a> was formed in 1907 by <a href="Hermann%20Muthesius">Hermann Muthesius</a> to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany's economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).
The entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as <a href="New%20Objectivity%20%28architecture%29">Neues Bauen</a>. Beginning in June 1907, <a href="Peter%20Behrens">Peter Behrens</a>' pioneering <a href="industrial%20design">industrial design</a> work for the German electrical company <a href="AEG">AEG</a> successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark <a href="AEG%20Turbine%20Factory">AEG Turbine Factory</a>, and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and <a href="Adolf%20Meyer%20%28architect%29">Adolf Meyer</a> worked for him in this period.

The Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German <a href="zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> had turned from emotional <a href="Expressionist%20architecture">Expressionism</a> to the matter-of-fact <a href="New%20Objectivity">New Objectivity</a>. An entire group of working architects, including <a href="Erich%20Mendelsohn">Erich Mendelsohn</a>, <a href="Bruno%20Taut">Bruno Taut</a> and <a href="Hans%20Poelzig">Hans Poelzig</a>, turned away from fanciful experimentation, and turned toward rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise of a "minimal dwelling" written into the new <a href="Weimar%20Constitution">Weimar Constitution</a>. <a href="Ernst%20May">Ernst May</a>, Bruno Taut, and <a href="Martin%20Wagner%20%28architect%29">Martin Wagner</a>, among others, built large housing blocks in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and Berlin. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the <a href="Weissenhof%20Estate">Weissenhof Estate</a>, films, and sometimes fierce public debate.

The Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a basic course in aesthetic principles, courses in <a href="color%20theory">color theory</a>, industrial design, and architecture. Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus, but it was less publicised outside the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and consequently, is less familiar in <a href="Western%20culture">the West</a>.

With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus. The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, <a href="El%20Lissitzky">El Lissitzky</a>'s book "Russia: an Architecture for World Revolution" published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects there.

The school was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar in 1919 as a merger of the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art. Its roots lay in the arts and crafts school founded by the <a href="William%20Ernest%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach</a> in 1906 and directed by Belgian <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> architect <a href="Henry%20van%20de%20Velde">Henry van de Velde</a>. When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius, <a href="Hermann%20Obrist">Hermann Obrist</a> and <a href="August%20Endell">August Endell</a> as possible successors. In 1919, after delays caused by the destruction of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and a lengthy debate over who should head the institution and the socio-economic meanings of a reconciliation of <a href="fine%20art">the fine arts</a> and <a href="Applied%20art">the applied arts</a> (an issue which remained a defining one throughout the school's existence), Gropius was made the director of a new institution integrating the two called the Bauhaus. In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled "Exhibition of Unknown Architects", Gropius proclaimed his goal as being "to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist." Gropius' <a href="neologism">neologism</a> "Bauhaus" references both building and the Bauhütte, a <a href="premodern">premodern</a> <a href="guild">guild</a> of stonemasons. The early intention was for the Bauhaus to be a combined architecture school, crafts school, and academy of the arts. In 1919 Swiss painter <a href="Johannes%20Itten">Johannes Itten</a>, German-American painter <a href="Lyonel%20Feininger">Lyonel Feininger</a>, and German sculptor <a href="Gerhard%20Marcks">Gerhard Marcks</a>, along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor and designer <a href="Oskar%20Schlemmer">Oskar Schlemmer</a> who headed the theater workshop, and Swiss painter <a href="Paul%20Klee">Paul Klee</a>, joined in 1922 by Russian painter <a href="Wassily%20Kandinsky">Wassily Kandinsky</a>. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter <a href="Theo%20van%20Doesburg">Theo van Doesburg</a> to Weimar to promote <a href="De%20Stijl">De Stijl</a> ("The Style"), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect <a href="El%20Lissitzky">El Lissitzky</a>.
From 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of <a href="Johannes%20Itten">Johannes Itten</a>, who taught the "Vorkurs" or "preliminary course" that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus. Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of <a href="Franz%20Ci%C5%BEek">Franz Cižek</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Fr%C3%B6bel">Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel</a>. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the <a href="Der%20Blaue%20Reiter">Blaue Reiter</a> group in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist <a href="Oskar%20Kokoschka">Oskar Kokoschka</a>. The influence of German <a href="Expressionism">Expressionism</a> favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of Der Blaue Reiter founding member <a href="Wassily%20Kandinsky">Wassily Kandinsky</a> to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1922. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Moholy-Nagy">László Moholy-Nagy</a>, who rewrote the "Vorkurs" with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favored by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907 when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while <a href="Hermann%20Muthesius">Hermann Muthesius</a> had begun implementing industrial prototypes.

Gropius was not necessarily against <a href="Expressionist%20architecture">Expressionism</a>, and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this "new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery," described "painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future." By 1923 however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring <a href="Regional%20characteristics%20of%20Romanesque%20architecture%23Romanesque%20architecture%2C%20regional%20characteristics">Romanesque cathedrals</a> and the craft-driven aesthetic of the "<a href="V%C3%B6lkisch%20movement">Völkisch movement</a>", instead declaring "we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars." Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called "Bauhaus" and a series of books called "Bauhausbücher". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.

<a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> was in the German state of <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, and the Bauhaus school received state support from the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democrat</a>-controlled Thuringian state government. The school in Weimar experienced political pressure from conservative circles in Thuringian politics, increasingly so after 1923 as political tension rose. One condition placed on the Bauhaus in this new political environment was the exhibition of work undertaken at the school. This condition was met in 1923 with the Bauhaus' exhibition of the experimental <a href="Haus%20am%20Horn">Haus am Horn</a>. The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school's funding in half. On 26 December 1924 the Bauhaus issued a press release and setting the closure of the school for the end of March 1925. At this point they had already been looking for alternative sources of funding. After the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, a school of industrial design with teachers and staff less antagonistic to the conservative political regime remained in Weimar. This school was eventually known as the Technical University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and in 1996 changed its name to <a href="Bauhaus-University%20Weimar">Bauhaus-University Weimar</a>.

Gropius's design for the <a href="Dessau">Dessau</a> facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the <a href="International%20style%20%28architecture%29">International style</a> lines of the <a href="Fagus%20Factory">Fagus Factory</a> than the stripped down <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture%23Regional%20trends">Neo-classical</a> of the Werkbund pavilion or the "<a href="V%C3%B6lkisch%20movement">Völkisch</a>" Sommerfeld House. During the Dessau years, there was a remarkable change in direction for the school. According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect <a href="Mart%20Stam">Mart Stam</a> to run the newly founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam's friend and colleague in the ABC group, Hannes Meyer.

Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928, and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the <a href="ADGB%20Trade%20Union%20School">Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes</a> (ADGB Trade Union School) in <a href="Bernau%20bei%20Berlin">Bernau bei Berlin</a>. Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.

But Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program, and forced the resignations of <a href="Herbert%20Bayer">Herbert Bayer</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>, and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn't want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930. The Dessau city council attempted to convince Gropius to return as head of the school, but Gropius instead suggested <a href="Ludwig%20Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a>. Mies was appointed in 1930, and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. Mies halted the school's manufacture of goods so that the school could focus on teaching. Mies appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant <a href="Lilly%20Reich">Lilly Reich</a>. By 1931, the <a href="National%20Socialist%20German%20Workers%27%20Party">National Socialist German Workers' Party</a> (Nazi Party) was becoming more influential in German politics. When they gained control of the Dessau City Council they moved to close the school.

In late 1932, Mies rented a derelict factory in Berlin to use as the new Bauhaus with his own money. The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> closed down the Berlin school. Mies protested the decision, eventually speaking to the head of the Gestapo, who agreed to allow the school to re-open. However, shortly after receiving a letter permitting the opening of the Bauhaus, Mies and the other faculty agreed to voluntarily shut down the school .

Although neither the Nazi Party nor <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like <a href="Wilhelm%20Frick">Wilhelm Frick</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Rosenberg">Alfred Rosenberg</a> had already labeled the Bauhaus "un-German" and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, a number of communist students loyal to Meyer moved to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> when he was fired in 1930.

Even before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its "<a href="degenerate%20art">degenerate art</a>", and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish influences of "cosmopolitan modernism". Despite Gropius's protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933. Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the "New Bauhaus" of Chicago: Mies decided to emigrate to the United States for the directorship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>) in Chicago and to seek building commissions. The simple engineering-oriented functionalism of stripped-down modernism, however, did lead to some Bauhaus influences living on in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. When Hitler's chief engineer, <a href="Fritz%20Todt">Fritz Todt</a>, began opening the new <a href="autobahn">autobahn</a> (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were "bold examples of modernism"—among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.

The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building, the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), he and his partner <a href="Adolf%20Meyer%20%28architect%29">Adolf Meyer</a> observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in <a href="Jena">Jena</a>, and the competition design for the <a href="Chicago%20Tribune%20Tower">Chicago Tribune Tower</a>, which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 <a href="Haus%20am%20Horn">Haus am Horn</a>, student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.

In the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed "Laubenganghäuser" (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the <a href="ADGB%20Trade%20Union%20School">Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes</a> (ADGB Trade Union School) in <a href="Bernau%20bei%20Berlin">Bernau bei Berlin</a>. Meyer's approach was to research users' needs and scientifically develop the design solution.

<a href="Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Mies van der Rohe</a> repudiated Meyer's politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius's "study of essentials", and Meyer's research into user requirements, Mies advocated a "spatial implementation of intellectual decisions", which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.

The popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries <a href="Bruno%20Taut">Bruno Taut</a>, <a href="Hans%20Poelzig">Hans Poelzig</a> and particularly <a href="Ernst%20May">Ernst May</a>, as the city architects of Berlin, <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> and <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in <a href="Weimar%20Germany">Weimar Germany</a>. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop <a href="Onkel%20Toms%20H%C3%BCtte%20%28Berlin%20U-Bahn%29">Onkel Toms Hütte</a>, is still occupied.

The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, the United States, Canada and <a href="Israel">Israel</a> in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by, the Nazi regime. Tel Aviv in 2004 was named to the list of <a href="world%20heritage">world heritage</a> sites by the UN due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture; it had some 4,000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 onwards.

In 1928, the Hungarian painter Alexander Bortnyik founded a school of design in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> called Miihely (also "Muhely" or "Mugely"), which means "the studio". Located on the seventh floor of a house on Nagymezo Street, it was meant to be the Hungarian equivalent to the Bauhaus. The literature sometimes refers to it—in an oversimplified manner—as "the Budapest Bauhaus". Bortnyik was a great admirer of <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Moholy-Nagy">László Moholy-Nagy</a> and had met Walter Gropius in Weimar between 1923 and 1925. Moholy-Nagy himself taught at the Miihely. <a href="Victor%20Vasarely">Victor Vasarely</a>, a pioneer of <a href="Op%20Art">Op Art</a>, studied at this school before establishing in Paris in 1930.

Walter Gropius, <a href="Marcel%20Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>, and Moholy-Nagy re-assembled in Britain during the mid 1930s to live and work in the <a href="Isokon">Isokon</a> project before the war caught up with them. Gropius and Breuer went to teach at the <a href="Harvard%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Design">Harvard Graduate School of Design</a> and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced The Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the <a href="Alan%20I%20W%20Frank%20House">Alan I W Frank House</a> in Pittsburgh, among other projects. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as <a href="Philip%20Johnson">Philip Johnson</a>, <a href="I.M.%20Pei">I.M. Pei</a>, <a href="Lawrence%20Halprin">Lawrence Halprin</a> and <a href="Paul%20Rudolph%20%28architect%29">Paul Rudolph</a>, among many others.

In the late 1930s, <a href="Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Mies van der Rohe</a> re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential <a href="Philip%20Johnson">Philip Johnson</a>, and became one of the pre-eminent architects in the world. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the <a href="New%20Bauhaus">New Bauhaus</a> school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist <a href="Walter%20Paepcke">Walter Paepcke</a>. This school became the <a href="Institute%20of%20Design%20IIT">Institute of Design</a>, part of the <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>. Printmaker and painter <a href="Werner%20Drewes">Werner Drewes</a> was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> and <a href="Washington%20University%20in%20St.%20Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. <a href="Herbert%20Bayer">Herbert Bayer</a>, sponsored by Paepcke, moved to <a href="Aspen%2C%20Colorado">Aspen</a>, Colorado in support of Paepcke's Aspen projects at the <a href="Aspen%20Institute">Aspen Institute</a>. In 1953, <a href="Max%20Bill">Max Bill</a>, together with <a href="Inge%20Scholl">Inge Aicher-Scholl</a> and <a href="Otl%20Aicher">Otl Aicher</a>, founded the <a href="Ulm%20School%20of%20Design">Ulm School of Design</a> (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung—HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of <a href="semiotics">semiotics</a> as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the "Ulm Model" concept continues to influence international design education.

The influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus "Vorkurs" (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes. This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the "Vorkurs" and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that "A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, can design anything from a dress to a kitchen stove".

One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of <a href="modern%20furniture">modern furniture</a> design. The ubiquitous <a href="Cantilever%20chair">Cantilever chair</a> and the <a href="Wassily%20Chair">Wassily Chair</a> designed by <a href="Marcel%20Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a> are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer <a href="Mart%20Stam">Mart Stam</a> over the rights to the cantilever chair patent. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, thus leading to the patent dispute.) The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.

The physical plant at Dessau survived <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the <a href="East%20Germany">German Democratic Republic</a>. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of "Bauhausbühne" ("Bauhaus Stage"). After <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s. In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.

Later evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of "… the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature…Home hygiene without home atmosphere."

Beowulf

Beowulf ( ) is an <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> epic poem consisting of 3,182 <a href="Alliterative%20verse">alliterative lines</a>. It may be the oldest surviving long poem in Old English and is commonly cited as one of the most important works of <a href="Old%20English%20literature">Old English literature</a>. A date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; the only certain dating pertains to the manuscript, which was produced between 975 and 1025. The author was an anonymous <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> poet, most likely from the Kingdom of Northumbria, referred to by scholars as the ""Beowulf" poet".

The poem is set in <a href="Scandza">Scandinavia</a>. <a href="Beowulf%20%28hero%29">Beowulf</a>, a hero of the <a href="Geats">Geats</a>, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the <a href="Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Danes</a>, whose <a href="mead%20hall">mead hall</a> in <a href="Heorot">Heorot</a> has been under attack by a monster known as <a href="Grendel">Grendel</a>. After Beowulf slays him, <a href="Grendel%27s%20mother">Grendel's mother</a> attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland (<a href="G%C3%B6taland">Götaland</a> in modern Sweden) and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty years has passed, Beowulf defeats a <a href="The%20Dragon%20%28Beowulf%29">dragon</a>, but is mortally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a tower on a headland in his memory.

The full poem survives in the manuscript known as the <a href="Nowell%20Codex">Nowell Codex</a>. It has no title in the original manuscript, but has become known by the name of the story's protagonist. In 1731, the manuscript was badly damaged by a fire that swept through <a href="Ashburnham%20House">Ashburnham House</a> in London that had a collection of medieval manuscripts assembled by <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Cotton%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Connington">Sir Robert Bruce Cotton</a>. The Nowell Codex is currently housed in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>.

The events in the poem take place over most of the sixth century, after the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> had started their journey to England and before the beginning of the seventh century, a time when the Anglo-Saxons were either newly arrived or were still in close contact with their <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic kinsmen</a> in Northern Germany. The poem may have been brought to England by people of Geatish origins. Many suggest that "Beowulf" was first composed in the 7th century at <a href="Rendlesham">Rendlesham</a> in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, that the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> <a href="ship%20burial">ship-burial</a> also shows close connections with Scandinavia, and that the East Anglian royal dynasty, the <a href="Wuffingas">Wuffingas</a>, may have been descendants of the Geatish <a href="Wulfing">Wulfing</a>s. Others have associated this poem with the court of King <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> or with the court of King <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut the Great</a>. 

The poem deals with legends, was composed for entertainment, and does not separate between fictional elements and real historic events, such as the raid by King <a href="Hygelac">Hygelac</a> into <a href="Frisia">Frisia</a>. Though Beowulf himself is not mentioned in any other Anglo-Saxon manuscript, scholars generally agree that many of the other personalities of "Beowulf" also appear in Scandinavian sources. (Specific works are designated in the following section). This does not only concern people (e.g., <a href="Halfdan">Healfdene</a>, <a href="Hrothgar">Hroðgar</a>, <a href="Halga">Halga</a>, <a href="Hr%C3%B3lfr%20Kraki">Hroðulf</a>, <a href="Eadgils">Eadgils</a> and <a href="Ohthere">Ohthere</a>), but also <a href="Norse%20clans">clans</a> (e.g., <a href="Scylding">Scylding</a>s, <a href="Yngling">Scylfings</a> and Wulfings) and some of the events (e.g., the <a href="Battle%20on%20the%20Ice%20of%20Lake%20V%C3%A4nern">Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern</a>). The dating of the events in the poem has been confirmed by archaeological excavations of the <a href="tumulus">barrows</a> indicated by <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a> and by Swedish tradition as the graves of Ohthere (dated to c. 530) and his son <a href="Eadgils">Eadgils</a> (dated to c. 575) in <a href="Uppland">Uppland</a>, Sweden.

In Denmark, recent archaeological excavations at <a href="Lejre">Lejre</a>, where Scandinavian tradition located the seat of the Scyldings, i.e., <a href="Heorot">Heorot</a>, have revealed that a hall was built in the mid-6th century, exactly the time period of "Beowulf". Three halls, each about long, were found during the excavation.
The majority view appears to be that people such as King Hroðgar and the Scyldings in "Beowulf" are based on real historical people from 6th-century Scandinavia. Like the "<a href="Finnesburg%20Fragment">Finnesburg Fragment</a>" and several shorter surviving poems, "Beowulf" has consequently been used as a source of information about Scandinavian personalities such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic personalities such as <a href="Offa%20of%20Angel">Offa</a>, king of the continental <a href="Angles">Angles</a>.

19th-century archeological evidence may confirm elements of the "Beowulf" story. <a href="Eadgils">Eadgils</a> was buried at <a href="Gamla%20Uppsala">Uppsala</a> according to <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a>. When Eadgils' mound (to the left in the photo) was excavated in 1874, the finds supported "Beowulf" and the sagas. They showed that a powerful man was buried in a large barrow, c. 575, on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. These remains include a <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> sword adorned with gold and garnets and a <a href="Tafl%20games">tafl game</a> with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a costly buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. This would have been a burial fitting a king who was famous for his wealth in Old Norse sources. <a href="Ongentheow">Ongentheow</a>'s barrow has not been excavated.

The protagonist <a href="Beowulf%20%28hero%29">Beowulf</a>, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, king of the <a href="Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Danes</a>, whose great hall, <a href="Heorot">Heorot</a>, is plagued by the monster <a href="Grendel">Grendel</a>. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands and Grendel's mother with a giant's sword that he found in her lair.

Later in his life, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats, and finds his realm terrorized by a <a href="The%20Dragon%20%28Beowulf%29">dragon</a>, some of whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacks the dragon with the help of his "<a href="thegn">thegn</a>s" or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at <a href="Earnaness">Earnanæs</a>, but only his young Swedish relative <a href="Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a>, whose name means "remnant of valour", dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honor.

"Beowulf" is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins "<a href="in%20medias%20res">in medias res</a>" or simply, "in the middle of things," which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been an ongoing event. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord.

"Beowulf" begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall <a href="Heorot">Heorot</a> for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife <a href="Wealh%C3%BEeow">Wealhtheow</a>, and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical <a href="Cain">Cain</a>, is pained by the sounds of a joy. Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.

Beowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.

Beowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of Grendel. When Grendel enters the hall, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up to clench Grendel's hand. Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently. Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel's skin. Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies.Beowulf displays "the whole of Grendel's shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp" for all to see at Heorot. This display would fuel her anger in revenge.

The next night, after celebrating Grendel's defeat, Hrothgar and his men sleep in Heorot. Grendel's mother, angry that her son has been killed, sets out to get revenge. "Beowulf was elsewhere. Earlier, after the award of treasure, The Geat had been given another lodging" his assistance would be absent in this battle. Grendel's mother violently kills <a href="%C3%86schere">Æschere</a>, who is Hrothgar's most loyal fighter, and escapes.

Hrothgar, Beowulf and their men track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. <a href="Unfer%C3%B0">Unferth</a>, a warrior who had doubted him and wishes to make amends, presents Beowulf with his sword <a href="Hrunting">Hrunting</a>. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake, at the bottom of which he finds a cavern containing Grendel's body and the remains of men that the two have killed. Grendel's mother and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.

At first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail. Beowulf, finding that Hrunting cannot harm his foe, puts it aside in fury. Beowulf is again saved from his opponent's attack by his armour. Beowulf takes another sword from Grendel's mother and slices her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel's mother's lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs his head. The blade of Beowulf's sword touches Grendel's toxic blood, and instantly dissolves so that only the hilt remains. Beowulf swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait in growing despair. Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel's head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot. Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword <a href="N%C3%A6gling">Nægling</a>, his family's heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as "Hrothgar's sermon", in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his <a href="thegn">thegn</a>s.

Beowulf returns home and eventually becomes king of his own people. One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a slave steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnanæs. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf's death, he is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geates are defenseless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory. ("Beowulf" lines 2712–3182).

"Beowulf" was written in England, but is set in Scandinavia; its dating has attracted considerable scholarly attention. The poem has been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries, with some recent scholarship offering what has been called "a cohesive and compelling case for Beowulf's early composition." However, opinion differs as to whether the composition of the poem is nearly contemporary with its transcription, whether it was first written in the 8th century, or if a proto-version of the poem was perhaps composed at an even earlier time (possibly as one of the <a href="Bear%27s%20Son%20Tale">Bear's Son Tale</a>s) and orally transmitted for many years, then transcribed in its present form at a later date. <a href="Albert%20Lord">Albert Lord</a> felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance, though likely taken at more than one sitting. <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon paganism</a> to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">Christianisation of England</a> around AD 700, and Tolkien's conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century has been defended by <a href="Tom%20Shippey">Tom Shippey</a>, Leonard Neidorf, Rafael J. Pascual, and R.D. Fulk, among others.

The claim to an early 11th-century date depends in part on scholars who argue that, rather than the transcription of a tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk, "Beowulf" reflects an original interpretation of an earlier version of the story by the manuscript's two scribes. On the other hand, some scholars argue that linguistic, paleographical, metrical, and onomastic considerations align to support a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century; in particular, the poem's regular observation of etymological length distinctions (Max Kaluza's law) has been thought to demonstrate a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century. However, scholars disagree about whether the metrical phenomena described by Kaluza's Law prove an early date of composition or are evidence of a longer prehistory of the Beowulf meter; B.R. Hutcheson, for instance, does not believe Kaluza's Law can be used to date the poem, while claiming that "the weight of all the evidence Fulk presents in his book tells strongly in favor of an eighth-century date."

"Beowulf" survives in a single manuscript dated on <a href="Palaeography">paleographical</a> grounds to the late 10th or early 11th century. The manuscript measures 245 × 185 mm.

The poem is known only from a single manuscript, which is estimated to date from close to AD 1000, in which it appears with other works. The "Beowulf" manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar <a href="Laurence%20Nowell">Laurence Nowell</a>. The official designation is "<a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, Cotton Vitellius A.XV" because it was one of <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Cotton%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Connington">Sir Robert Bruce Cotton</a>'s holdings in the <a href="Cotton%20library">Cotton library</a> in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own <a href="library%20classification">library classification</a> systems. "Cotton Vitellius A.XV" translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor <a href="Vitellius">Vitellius</a> standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through <a href="William%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burghley">William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley</a>, in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a <a href="tutor">tutor</a> to his ward, <a href="Edward%20de%20Vere%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford</a>. .

The earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by <a href="Franciscus%20Junius%20%28the%20younger%29">Franciscus Junius (the younger)</a>. The ownership of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery. 

The Reverend <a href="Thomas%20Smith%20%28scholar%29">Thomas Smith</a> (1638–1710) and <a href="Humfrey%20Wanley">Humfrey Wanley</a> (1672–1726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705. The "Beowulf" manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the "Beowulf" script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley "I can find nothing yet of Beowulph." Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the "Beowulf" manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.

It suffered damage in the Cotton Library fire at <a href="Ashburnham%20House">Ashburnham House</a> in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss. Kevin Kiernan, in preparing his electronic edition of the manuscript, used fibre-optic backlighting and ultraviolet lighting to reveal letters in the manuscript lost from binding, erasure, or ink blotting.

The "Beowulf" manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes, one of whom wrote the prose at the beginning of the manuscript and the first 1939 lines before breaking off in mid sentence. The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context. While both scribes appear to proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors. The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist of the two as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but rather copied what he saw in front of him. In the way that it is currently bound, the "Beowulf" manuscript is followed by the Old English poem "<a href="Judith%20%28poem%29">Judith</a>". "Judith" was written by same the scribe that completed "Beowulf" as evidenced through similar writing style. Worm-holes found in the last leaves of the "Beowulf" manuscript that aren't present in the "Judith" manuscript suggest that at one point "Beowulf" ended the volume. The rubbed appearance of some leaves also suggest that the manuscript stood on a shelf unbound, as is known to have been the case with other Old English manuscripts. From knowledge of books held in the library at <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">Malmesbury Abbey</a> and available as source works, and from the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the text, the transcription may have taken place there.

Icelandic scholar <a href="Gr%C3%ADmur%20J%C3%B3nsson%20Thorkelin">Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin</a> made the first transcriptions of the manuscript in 1786 and published the results in 1815, working as part of a Danish government historical research commission. He made one himself, and had another done by a professional copyist who knew no Anglo-Saxon. Since that time, however, the manuscript has crumbled further, making these transcripts a prized witness to the text. While the recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to them, their accuracy has been called into question, and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in Thorkelin's time is uncertain.

In 1805, the historian <a href="Sharon%20Turner">Sharon Turner</a> translated selected verses into <a href="modern%20English">modern English</a>. This was followed in 1814 by <a href="John%20Josias%20Conybeare">John Josias Conybeare</a> who published an edition "in English paraphrase and Latin verse translation." In 1815, <a href="Gr%C3%ADmur%20J%C3%B3nsson%20Thorkelin">Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin</a> published the first complete edition in Latin. <a href="N.%20F.%20S.%20Grundtvig">N. F. S. Grundtvig</a> reviewed this edition in 1815 and created the first complete verse translation in Danish in 1820. In 1837, <a href="John%20Mitchell%20Kemble">John Mitchell Kemble</a> created an important literal translation in English. In 1895, <a href="William%20Morris">William Morris</a> & A. J. Wyatt published the ninth English translation. Many retellings of "Beowulf" for children also appeared around the beginning of the 20th century. In 1909, <a href="Francis%20Barton%20Gummere">Francis Barton Gummere</a>'s full translation in "English imitative meter" was published, and was used as the text of Gareth Hinds's graphic novel based on "Beowulf" in 2007.

During the early 20th century, <a href="Frederick%20Klaeber">Frederick Klaeber</a>'s "Beowulf and The Fight at Finnsburg" (which included the poem in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>, an extensive glossary of Old English terms, and general background information) became the "central source used by graduate students for the study of the poem and by scholars and teachers as the basis of their translations."

A great number of translations are available, in poetry and prose. Andy Orchard, in "A Critical Companion to Beowulf", lists 33 "representative" translations in his bibliography, and it has been translated into at least 23 other languages.

<a href="Seamus%20Heaney">Seamus Heaney</a>'s 1999 translation of the poem (referred to by Howell Chickering and many others as "Heaneywulf") was widely publicized. Translating "Beowulf" is one of the subjects of the 2012 publication "Beowulf at Kalamazoo", containing a section with 10 essays on translation, and a section with 22 reviews of Heaney's translation (some of which compare Heaney's work with that of Anglo-Saxon scholar <a href="Roy%20Liuzza">Roy Liuzza</a>). R. D. Fulk, of <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a>, published the first facing-page edition and translation of the <a href="Nowell%20Codex">entire manuscript</a> in the <a href="Dumbarton%20Oaks%20Medieval%20Library">Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library</a> series in 2010.

<a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s long-awaited translation (edited by his son, <a href="Christopher%20Tolkien">Christopher</a>) was published in 2014 as "". This also includes Tolkien's own retelling of the story of Beowulf in his tale, "Sellic Spell".

The question of whether "Beowulf" was passed down through <a href="oral%20tradition">oral tradition</a> prior to its present <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a> form has been the subject of much debate, and involves more than simply the issue of its composition. Rather, given the implications of the theory of <a href="oral-formulaic%20composition">oral-formulaic composition</a> and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.

Scholarly discussion about "Beowulf" in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesise a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the fire drake narrative). These fragments would have been told for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaising. There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem; it sees the poem as initially the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself perhaps a convert (or one whose forebears had been pagan), a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of a masterful "repurposing" of poetry from the oral tradition.

However, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of <a href="oral-formulaic%20composition">oral-formulaic composition</a>, which hypothesises that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them, and only much later written down. In his landmark work, "<a href="The%20Singer%20of%20Tales">The Singer of Tales</a>", <a href="Albert%20Lord">Albert Lord</a> refers to the work of <a href="Francis%20Peabody%20Magoun">Francis Peabody Magoun</a> and others, saying "the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate. This exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that Beowulf was composed orally."

Examination of "Beowulf" and other <a href="Old%20English%20literature">Old English literature</a> for evidence of oral-formulaic composition has met with mixed response. While "themes" (inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event, such as the "arming the hero", or the particularly well-studied "hero on the beach" theme) do exist across Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic works, some scholars conclude that Anglo-Saxon poetry is a mix of oral-formulaic and literate patterns, arguing that the poems both were composed on a word-by-word basis and followed larger formulae and patterns.

Larry Benson argued that the interpretation of "Beowulf" as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyze the poem in a unified manner, and with due attention to the poet's creativity. Instead, he proposed that other pieces of Germanic literature contain "kernels of tradition" from which "Beowulf" borrows and expands upon. A few years later, Ann Watts argued against the imperfect application of one theory to two different traditions: traditional, Homeric, oral-formulaic poetry and Anglo-Saxon poetry. Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, arguing that the "Beowulf" text is of too varied a nature to be completely constructed from set formulae and themes.

<a href="John%20Miles%20Foley">John Miles Foley</a> wrote, referring to the "Beowulf" debate, that while comparative work was both necessary and valid, it must be conducted with a view to the particularities of a given tradition; Foley argued with a view to developments of oral traditional theory that do not assume, or depend upon, ultimately unverifiable assumptions about composition, and instead delineate a more fluid continuum of traditionality and textuality.

Finally, in the view of Ursula Schaefer, the question of whether the poem was "oral" or "literate" becomes something of a <a href="red%20herring">red herring</a>. In this model, the poem is created, and is interpretable, within both noetic horizons. Schaefer's concept of "vocality" offers neither a compromise nor a synthesis of the views which see the poem as on the one hand Germanic, pagan, and oral and on the other Latin-derived, Christian, and literate, but, as stated by Monika Otter: "... a 'tertium quid', a modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has a logic and aesthetic of its own."

Neither identified sources nor <a href="Analogue%20%28literature%29">analogues</a> for "Beowulf" can be definitively proven, but many conjectures have been made. These are important in helping historians understand the "Beowulf" manuscript, as possible source-texts or influences would suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries within which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was "popular" and where its "popularity" took it). There are five main categories in which potential sources and/or analogues are included: Scandinavian parallels, <a href="early%20Irish%20literature">early Irish literature</a> sources and analogues, classical sources, <a href="Ecclesiology">ecclesiastical</a> sources, and echoes in other Old English texts.

Early studies into Scandinavian sources and analogues proposed that "Beowulf" was a translation of an original Scandinavian work, but this idea has been discarded. In 1878, <a href="Gu%C3%B0brandur%20Vigf%C3%BAsson">Guðbrandur Vigfússon</a> made the connection between "Beowulf" and the "<a href="Grettis%20saga">Grettis saga</a>". This is currently one of the few Scandinavian <a href="Analogue%20%28literature%29">analogues</a> to receive a general consensus of potential connection. Tales concerning the <a href="Scylding">Skjöldungs</a>, possibly originating as early as the 6th century were later used as a narrative basis in such texts as "<a href="Gesta%20Danorum">Gesta Danorum</a>" by <a href="Saxo%20Grammaticus">Saxo Grammaticus</a> and "<a href="Hr%C3%B3lfs%20saga%20kraka">Hrólfs saga kraka</a>". Some scholars see "Beowulf" as a product of these early tales along with "<a href="Gesta%20Danorum">Gesta Danorum</a>" and "<a href="Hr%C3%B3lfs%20saga%20kraka">Hrólfs saga kraka</a>", and some early scholars of the poem proposed that the latter saga and "Beowulf" share a common legendary ancestry, "Beowulf"s Hrothulf being identified with <a href="Hr%C3%B3lfr%20Kraki%23Beowulf">Hrólf Kraki</a>. Paul Beekman Taylor argued that the "<a href="Ynglinga%20saga">Ynglinga saga</a>" was proof that the "Beowulf" poet was likewise working from Germanic tradition.

Friedrich Panze attempted to contextualise "Beowulf" and other Scandinavian works, including "Grettis saga", under the international <a href="folklore">folktale</a> type 301B, or <a href="Bear%27s%20Son%20Tale">"The Bear's Son" tale</a>. However, although this <a href="Folkloristics">folkloristic</a> approach was seen as a step in the right direction, "The Bear's Son" tale was seen as too universal. Later, <a href="Peter%20J%C3%B8rgensen%20%28entomologist%29">Peter Jørgensen</a>, looking for a more concise frame of reference, coined a "two-troll tradition" that covers both "Beowulf" and "Grettis saga": "a <a href="Viking%20art">Norse</a> '<a href="ecotype">ecotype</a>' in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants, usually of different sexes".

Scholars who favored Irish parallels directly spoke out against <a href="Scandinavia">pro-Scandinavian</a> theories, citing them as unjustified. <a href="Wilhelm%20Grimm">Wilhelm Grimm</a> is noted to be the first person to link "Beowulf" with Irish folklore; however, Max Deutschbein is the first person to present the argument in academic form. He suggested the Irish "<a href="Bricriu">Feast of Bricriu</a>" as a source for "Beowulf"—a theory that was soon denied by Oscar Olson. Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm Von Sydow argued against both Scandinavian translation and source material due to his theory that "Beowulf" is fundamentally <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been <a href="paganism">pagan</a>.

In the late 1920s, Heinzer Dehmer suggested "Beowulf" as contextually based in the <a href="folklore">folktale</a> type "The Hand and the Child," due to the <a href="Motif%20%28narrative%29">motif</a> of the "monstrous arm"—a motif that distances "Grettis saga" and "Beowulf" and further aligns "Beowulf" with Irish parallelism. <a href="James%20Carney%20%28scholar%29">James Carney</a> and Martin Puhvel also agree with this "Hand and the Child" contextualisation. Carney also ties "Beowulf" to Irish literature through the "<a href="T%C3%A1in%20B%C3%B3">Táin Bó</a>" "<a href="Fr%C3%A1ech">Fráech</a>" story. Puhvel supported the "Hand and the Child" theory through such motifs as (in Andersson's words) "the more powerful giant mother, the mysterious light in the cave, the melting of the sword in blood, the phenomenon of battle rage, swimming prowess, combat with water monsters, underwater adventures, and the bear-hug style of wrestling."

Attempts to find <a href="Classics">classical</a> or <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> influence or analogue in "Beowulf" are almost exclusively linked with <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" or <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>". In 1926, <a href="Albert%20Stanburrough%20Cook">Albert Stanburrough Cook</a> suggested a Homeric connection due to equivalent formulas, <a href="metonymy">metonymies</a>, and analogous voyages. In 1930, James A. Work also supported the Homeric influence, stating that encounter between Beowulf and <a href="Unfer%C3%B0">Unferth</a> was parallel to the encounter between Odysseus and <a href="Nisus%20and%20Euryalus">Euryalus</a> in Books 7–8 of the "Odyssey," even to the point of both characters giving the hero the same gift of a sword upon being proven wrong in their initial assessment of the hero's prowess. This theory of Homer's influence on "Beowulf" remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely "comparative literature", although Greek was known in late 7th century England: <a href="Bede">Bede</a> states that <a href="Theodore%20of%20Tarsus">Theodore of Tarsus</a>, a Greek, was appointed <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in 668, and he taught Greek. Several English scholars and churchmen are described by Bede as being fluent in Greek due to being taught by him; Bede claims to be fluent in Greek himself.

<a href="Frederick%20Klaeber">Frederick Klaeber</a>, among others, argued for a connection between "Beowulf" and <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> near the start of the 20th century, claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a Germanic world represents Virgilian influence. Virgil was seen as the pinnacle of Latin literature, and Latin was the dominant literary language of England at the time, therefore making Virgilian influence highly likely. Similarly, in 1971, <a href="Alistair%20Campbell%20%28academic%29">Alistair Campbell</a> stated that the <a href="apologue">apologue</a> technique used in "Beowulf" is so rare in epic poetry aside from Virgil that the poet who composed "Beowulf" could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s writings.

It cannot be denied that Biblical parallels occur in the text, whether seen as a pagan work with "Christian colouring" added by scribes or as a "Christian historical novel, with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as 'local colour'," as Margaret E. Goldsmith did in "The Christian Theme of "Beowulf,"". "Beowulf" channels the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>, the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a>, and the <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Book of Daniel</a> in its inclusion of references to the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">Genesis creation narrative</a>, the story of <a href="Cain%20and%20Abel">Cain and Abel</a>, <a href="Noah">Noah</a> and the <a href="flood%20myth">flood myth</a>, the <a href="Devil%20in%20Christianity">Devil</a>, <a href="Hell">Hell</a>, and the <a href="Last%20Judgment">Last Judgment</a>.

The poem mixes the <a href="West%20Saxon%20dialect">West Saxon</a> and <a href="Old%20English%23Dialects">Anglian dialects</a> of Old English, though it predominantly uses West Saxon, as do other Old English poems copied at the time.

There is a wide array of linguistic forms in the "Beowulf" manuscript. It is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that "Beowulf" has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas. The poem retains a complicated mix of the following dialectical forms: <a href="Mercian%20dialect">Mercian</a>, <a href="Northumbrian%20dialect">Northumbrian</a>, Early West Saxon, Kentish and Late West Saxon. There are in "Beowulf" more than 3100 distinct words, and almost 1300 occur exclusively, or almost exclusively, in this poem and in the other poetical texts. Considerably more than one-third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in "Beowulf", and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix "ge"- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have "ge"-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-fourth is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.

An Old English poem such as "Beowulf" is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used <a href="alliterative%20verse">alliterative verse</a>, a form of <a href="poetry">verse</a> in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through <a href="alliteration">similarity in initial sound</a>. In addition, the two halves are divided by a <a href="caesura">caesura</a>: "Oft Scyld Scefing \\ sceaþena þreatum" (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three (Oft SCYLD SCEFING, with <a href="Systems%20of%20scansion%23Overview">ictus</a> on the suffix -ING) whereas the second has two (SCEAþena ÞREATum).

The poet has a choice of <a href="epithets">epithets</a> or formulae to use in order to fulfill the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in <a href="modern%20English">modern English</a>. The letter , for example, is always pronounced ("Hroðgar": ), and the digraph is pronounced , as in the word "edge". Both and vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or <a href="voice%20%28phonetics%29">voiced</a> consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern and , respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern in "fat" and in "sat". Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, , and eth, – representing both pronunciations of modern English , as in "thing" and "this" – are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of and . Both are voiced (as in "this") between other voiced sounds: "oðer", "laþleas", "suþern". Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in "thing"): "þunor", "suð", "soþfæst".

<a href="Kenning">Kenning</a>s are also a significant technique in "Beowulf". They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the "swan-road" or the "whale-road"; a king might be called a "ring-giver." There are many kennings in "Beowulf", and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of <a href="elision">elided</a> <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>s.

<a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> argued that the poem is an <a href="elegy">elegy</a>.

The history of modern "Beowulf" criticism is often said to begin with <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, author and Merton professor of Anglo-Saxon at <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, who in his 1936 lecture to the <a href="British%20Academy">British Academy</a> criticised his contemporaries' excessive interest in its historical implications. He noted in "" that as a result the poem's literary value had been largely overlooked and argued that the poem "is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content..."

In historical terms, the poem's characters would have been <a href="Norse%20religion">Norse pagans</a> (the historical events of the poem took place before the <a href="Christianization%20of%20Scandinavia">Christianisation of Scandinavia</a>), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon paganism</a> around the 7th century – both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of <a href="Germanic%20paganism">Germanic paganism</a>. "Beowulf" thus depicts a <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic warrior society</a>, in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.

Stanley B. Greenfield has suggested that references to the human body throughout "Beowulf" emphasise the relative position of thanes to their lord. He argues that the term "shoulder-companion" could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new "arm." Also, Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with <a href="Unfer%C3%B0">Unferð</a> (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unferð is described as "at the king's feet" (line 499). Unferð is also a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and "generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action."

At the same time, Richard North argues that the "Beowulf" poet interpreted "Danish myths in Christian form" (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: "As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of "Beowulf" liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the <a href="Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Danes</a> as 's' rather than as foreigners." <a href="Grendel%27s%20mother">Grendel's mother</a> and <a href="Grendel">Grendel</a> are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.

Other scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:
The location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed. In 1914, <a href="F.W.%20Moorman">F.W. Moorman</a>, the first professor of English Language at <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">University of Leeds</a>, claimed that "Beowulf" was composed in Yorkshire, but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago, during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript "which alone preserves the poem" originated in the kingdom of the <a href="Wessex">West Saxons</a> – as it is more commonly known. Donaldson wrote that "the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and ... poem reflects a Christian tradition".

Blazing Saddles

Blazing Saddles is a 1974 American <a href="Satire">satirical</a> <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Western</a> <a href="comedy%20film">comedy film</a> directed by <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a>. Starring <a href="Cleavon%20Little">Cleavon Little</a> and <a href="Gene%20Wilder">Gene Wilder</a>, the film was written by Brooks, <a href="Andrew%20Bergman">Andrew Bergman</a>, <a href="Richard%20Pryor">Richard Pryor</a>, Norman Steinberg, and Al Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>, and is ranked No. 6 on the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>'s "<a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Laughs">100 Years...100 Laughs</a>" list.

Brooks appears in two supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane and a <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>-speaking Indian chief; he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes <a href="Slim%20Pickens">Slim Pickens</a>, <a href="Alex%20Karras">Alex Karras</a>, and <a href="David%20Huddleston">David Huddleston</a>, as well as Brooks regulars <a href="Dom%20DeLuise">Dom DeLuise</a>, <a href="Madeline%20Kahn">Madeline Kahn</a>, and <a href="Harvey%20Korman">Harvey Korman</a>. Bandleader <a href="Count%20Basie">Count Basie</a> has a cameo as himself.

The film satirizes the <a href="racism">racism</a> obscured by myth-making <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> accounts of the <a href="American%20frontier">American West</a>, with the hero being a <a href="African%20Americans">black</a> <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">sheriff</a> in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate <a href="anachronism">anachronism</a>s, from the <a href="Count%20Basie%20Orchestra">Count Basie Orchestra</a> playing "<a href="April%20in%20Paris%20%28song%29">April in Paris</a>" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the "<a href="Wide%20World%20of%20Sports%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Wide World of Sports</a>", to the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German army</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

In the <a href="American%20frontier">American frontier</a> of 1874, construction on a new railroad will soon be going through Rock Ridge, a town inhabited exclusively by white people with the surname Johnson. The conniving attorney general Hedley Lamarr wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, thereby lowering land prices. After he sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town, the townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker who was about to be executed for starting a fight. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.

With his quick wits and the assistance of the Waco Kid, Bart works to overcome the townspeople's hostile reception. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp at her own game. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>smen, Nazis, and <a href="Methodism">Methodists</a>.

Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black and Chinese railroad workers — who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community — and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; but with no people in it, Bart realizes it won't fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the "Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway," forcing the raiding party to turn back for "a shitload of dimes" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are boobytrapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.

The resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs breaks the <a href="fourth%20wall">fourth wall</a>, spilling onto a neighboring set where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a <a href="Busby%20Berkeley">Busby Berkeley</a>-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Studios%2C%20Burbank">Warner Bros. film lot</a> into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to "drive me off this picture". He ducks into <a href="Grauman%27s%20Chinese%20Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a>, which is playing the premiere of "Blazing Saddles". As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on. Riding out of town, he finds Jim, and invites him along to "nowhere special". They ride off into the sunset in a chauffeured <a href="stretch%20limousine">stretch limousine</a>.


Cast notes

The idea for the film came from a story outline written by <a href="Andrew%20Bergman">Andrew Bergman</a> that he originally intended to develop and produce himself. "I wrote a first draft called "Tex-X,"" (a play on <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>'s name), he said. "<a href="Alan%20Arkin">Alan Arkin</a> was hired to direct and <a href="James%20Earl%20Jones">James Earl Jones</a> was going to play the sheriff. That fell apart, as things often do." Brooks was taken with the story, which he described as "hip talk—1974 talk and expressions—happening in 1874 in the Old West," and purchased the film rights from Bergman. Though he had not worked with a writing team since "<a href="Your%20Show%20of%20Shows">Your Show of Shows</a>", he hired a group of writers (including Bergman) to expand the outline, and posted a large sign: "Please do not write a polite script." Brooks described the writing process as chaotic: ""Blazing Saddles" was more or less written in the middle of a drunken fistfight. There were five of us all yelling loudly for our ideas to be put into the movie. Not only was I the loudest, but luckily I also had the right as director to decide what was in or out." Bergman remembers the room being just as chaotic, telling "Creative Screenwriting", "In the beginning, we had five people. One guy left after a couple of weeks. Then, it was basically me, Mel, Richie Pryor and Norman Steinberg. Richie left after the first draft and then Norman, Mel and I wrote the next three or four drafts. It was a riot. It was a rioter’s room!"

The original title, "Tex X", was rejected, as were "Black Bart" and "Purple Sage". Brooks said he finally conceived "Blazing Saddles" one morning while taking a shower. For the movie's title song, Brooks advertised in the trade papers for a "<a href="Frankie%20Laine">Frankie Laine</a>-type" singer; to his surprise, Laine himself offered his services. "Frankie sang his heart out ... and we didn't have the heart to tell him it was a spoof. He never heard the whip cracks; we put those in later. We got so lucky with his serious interpretation of the song."

Casting was problematic. <a href="Richard%20Pryor">Richard Pryor</a> was Brooks' original choice to play the sheriff, but the studio, claiming his history of drug arrests made him uninsurable, refused to approve financing with Pryor as the star. Cleavon Little was cast in the role, and Pryor remained as a writer. Brooks offered the other leading role, the Waco Kid, to <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a>; he declined, deeming the film "too blue" for his family-oriented image, but assured Brooks that "he would be the first one in line to see it." <a href="Gig%20Young">Gig Young</a> was cast, but he collapsed during his first scene from what was later determined to be <a href="alcohol%20withdrawal%20syndrome">alcohol withdrawal syndrome</a>, and Gene Wilder was flown in to replace him. <a href="Johnny%20Carson">Johnny Carson</a> and Wilder both turned down the Hedley Lamarr role before Harvey Korman was cast. Madeline Kahn objected when Brooks asked to see her legs during her audition. "She said, 'So it’s THAT kind of an audition?'" Brooks recalled. "I explained that I was a happily married man and that I needed someone who could straddle a chair with her legs like <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> in "<a href="Destry%20Rides%20Again">Destry Rides Again</a>." So she lifted her skirt and said, 'No touching.'"

Brooks had numerous conflicts over content with Warner Bros. executives, including frequent use of the word "<a href="nigger">nigger</a>," Lili Von Shtupp's seduction scene, the cacophony of flatulence around the campfire, and Mongo punching out a horse. Brooks, whose contract gave him final content control, declined to make any substantive changes, with the exception of cutting Bart's final line during Lili's seduction: "I hate to disappoint you, ma'am, but you're sucking my arm." When asked later about the many "nigger" references, Brooks said he received consistent support from Pryor and Little. He added, "If they did a remake of "Blazing Saddles" today, they would leave out the N-word. And then, you've got no movie." Brooks said he received many letters of complaint after the film's release, " ... but of course, most of them were from white people."

The film was almost not released. “When we screened it for executives, there were few laughs," said Brooks. "The head of distribution said, 'Let’s dump it and take a loss.’ But [studio president John] Calley insisted they open it in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago as a test. It became the studio’s top moneymaker that summer.” The world premiere took place on February 7, 1974, at the Pickwick Drive-In Theater in Burbank; 250 invited guests—including Little and Wilder—watched the film on horseback.

<a href="Hedy%20Lamarr">Hedy Lamarr</a> sued Warner Bros., charging that the film's running parody of her name infringed on her right to privacy. Brooks said he was flattered; the studio settled out of court for a small sum and an apology for “almost using her name." Brooks said that Lamarr "never got the joke."

While the film is now considered a classic comedy, critical reaction was mixed when the film was released. <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> wrote:
<a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film four stars and called it a "crazed grabbag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a <a href="rubber%20chicken">rubber chicken</a>. Mostly, it succeeds. It's an audience picture; it doesn't have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course! What does that matter while Alex Karras is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?"

The film grossed $119.5 million at the box office, becoming only the tenth film up to that time to pass the $100 million mark.

On the <a href="film-critic">film-critic</a>s aggregator <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film has 90% positive reviews, saying, "Daring, provocative, and laugh-out-loud funny, Blazing Saddles is a gleefully vulgar spoof of Westerns that marks a high point in Mel Brooks' storied career." 

The film received three <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nominations in <a href="47th%20Academy%20Awards">1974</a>: <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">Best Actress in a Supporting Role</a> (Madeline Kahn), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Film%20Editing">Best Film Editing</a>, and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song">Best Music, Original Song</a> (the title song). The film also earned two <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">BAFTA</a> awards nominations, for <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Newcomer">Best Newcomer</a> (Cleavon Little) and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay">Best Screenplay</a>.

The film won the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a> for "<a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Screenplay">Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen</a>" for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger.

In 2006, "Blazing Saddles" was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> and was selected for preservation in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>.

The film is recognized by <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> in these lists:


A television series titled "Black Bart" was produced for CBS based on Bergman's original story. It featured <a href="Louis%20Gossett%2C%20Jr.">Louis Gossett, Jr.</a> as Bart and <a href="Steve%20Landesberg">Steve Landesberg</a> as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named "Reb Jordan." Other cast members included Millie Slavin and <a href="Noble%20Willingham">Noble Willingham</a>. Bergman is listed as the sole creator.

CBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode featured guest appearances by <a href="Gerrit%20Graham">Gerrit Graham</a> and <a href="Brooke%20Adams%20%28actress%29">Brooke Adams</a> and was written by Michael Elias and Rich Eustis. Elias and Eutis later created and executive produced the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> sitcom "<a href="Head%20of%20the%20Class">Head of the Class</a>" (1986–1991).

Interviewed in 1996, Steve Landesberg said "Black Bart" "was like a joke. ... We did the pilot, and CBS dumped it at the end of the 1975 season in April or May on a Friday. We thought it was done, then CBS tells us to come back and film six more episodes. And then another six. Six episodes each season, when an order was usually for 24 or 26. I was on "<a href="Barney%20Miller">Barney Miller</a>" by that point, and we'd film during the winter break when all other TV shows were on hiatus. And they never aired any of them. It was like a sick joke. If I wasn't under contract I would have walked, but they were paying me so I can't complain."

In 1989, Louis Gossett, Jr. told "Entertainment Tonight", "CBS and Warner Bros. made a deal. ... The deal was that CBS would get to air "Blazing Saddles", and any sequels from the movie, in exchange for co-producing a TV show. At the time Warners wanted to make "Blazing Saddles" into a comedy series of films, a new one coming out every year or so. They wanted to use the model that the Brits had for the "<a href="Carry%20On%20%28franchise%29">Carry On</a>" films. But [Mel] Brooks had a clause in his contract that said Warner had to keep producing "Blazing Saddles" stories, in the movies or TV, or they'd lose the rights to make sequels. The TV show was a way to keep the rights. They didn't have to air it, just keep producing it. So for four years I spent my winter on a soundstage being paid to be in show that would never see the light of day, just so Warners could keep the sequel rights to "Blazing Saddles". By 1979 they finally figured out the market had changed and they weren't going to make any sequels, so we were cancelled, if a show that never was supposed to air can be cancelled."

Mel Brooks addressed the existence of the "Black Bart" series in 2005: "My lawyers, bless their souls, came to me and said, 'Warner Bros. is going to try and take away your control of the movie. Let's put in a crazy condition that says they can't do any sequels unless they make it right away or make a TV show out of it within six months.' Which is brilliant. They couldn't make a sequel in six months, and the movie was too vulgar to be a TV show. Now it would air in family hour if that was still a thing. So the lawyers put that in, never thinking they'd make a TV show. ... In 1977, three years later, Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another "Blazing Saddles", and I say, 'No. You don't have the right to do that.' They say, 'Yes we do, we've been making a TV series and still control the rights.' What TV series? I haven't seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it. <a href="Oy%20gevalt">Oy gevalt</a>! Well, management changed and they never did "Blazing Saddles 2", and as far as I know they're still making that stupid show to this day."

The pilot episode of "Black Bart" was later included as a bonus feature on the "Blazing Saddles" 30th Anniversary DVD and the <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> disc.

The first studio-licensed release of the full music soundtrack to "Blazing Saddles" was on <a href="La-La%20Land%20Records">La-La Land Records</a> on August 26, 2008. Remastered from original studio vault elements, the limited edition CD (a run of 3000) features the songs from the film as well as composer <a href="John%20Morris%20%28composer%29">John Morris</a>'s score. Instrumental versions of all the songs are bonus tracks on the disc. The disc features exclusive liner notes featuring comments from Mel Brooks and John Morris.

The 2017 animated film "<a href="Blazing%20Samurai">Blazing Samurai</a>," starring <a href="Michael%20Cera">Michael Cera</a>, <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>, <a href="Michelle%20Yeoh">Michelle Yeoh</a>, and <a href="Ricky%20Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a>, has been characterized by its creators as "equally inspired by and an homage to "Blazing Saddles"." Brooks served as an executive producer for the production, and voiced one of the characters.

The film was first released on DVD in 1997. In 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray. A 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray set was released in 2014.

In September 2017, Mel Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage play version of "Blazing Saddles" in the future.

<doc id="3840" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3840" title="Brain abscess">
Brain abscess

Brain abscess (or cerebral abscess) is an <a href="abscess">abscess</a> caused by inflammation and collection of infected material, coming from local (ear infection, <a href="dental%20abscess">dental abscess</a>, infection of <a href="paranasal%20sinus">paranasal sinus</a>es, infection of the <a href="mastoid">mastoid</a> air cells of the temporal bone, <a href="epidural%20abscess">epidural abscess</a>) or remote (<a href="Human%20lung">lung</a>, <a href="Human%20heart">heart</a>, <a href="kidney">kidney</a> etc.) infectious sources, within the <a href="human%20brain">brain</a> tissue. The infection may also be introduced through a skull fracture following a <a href="head%20trauma">head trauma</a> or surgical procedures. Brain abscess is usually associated with <a href="congenital%20heart%20disease">congenital heart disease</a> in young children. It may occur at any age but is most frequent in the third decade of life.

Fever, headache, and neurological problems, while classic, only occur in 20% of people with brain abscess.

The symptoms of brain abscess are caused by a combination of increased <a href="intracranial%20pressure">intracranial pressure</a> due to a space-occupying lesion (headache, vomiting, confusion, <a href="coma">coma</a>), infection (fever, fatigue etc.) and focal neurologic brain tissue damage (<a href="hemiparesis">hemiparesis</a>, <a href="aphasia">aphasia</a> etc.). The most frequent presenting symptoms are headache, drowsiness, <a href="mental%20confusion">confusion</a>, <a href="seizure">seizure</a>s, hemiparesis or speech difficulties together with fever with a rapidly progressive course. The symptoms and findings depend largely on the specific location of the abscess in the brain. An abscess in the cerebellum, for instance, may cause additional complaints as a result of <a href="brain%20stem">brain stem</a> compression and <a href="hydrocephalus">hydrocephalus</a>. <a href="Neurological%20examination">Neurological examination</a> may reveal a stiff neck in occasional cases (erroneously suggesting meningitis). The famous triad of fever, headache and focal neurologic findings are highly suggestive of brain abscess.

Anaerobic and microaerophilic cocci and gram-negative and gram-positive <a href="anaerobic%20infection">anaerobic</a> bacilli are the predominate bacterial <a href="Isolation%20%28microbiology%29">isolate</a>s. Many brain abscesses are polymicrobical. The predominant organisms include: "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>", aerobic and anaerobic streptococci (especially "<a href="Streptococcus%20intermedius">Streptococcus intermedius</a>"), "<a href="Bacteroides">Bacteroides</a>", "<a href="Prevotella">Prevotella</a>", and "<a href="Fusobacterium">Fusobacterium</a>" species, Enterobacteriaceae, "<a href="Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a>" species, and other anaerobes. Less common organisms include: "Haemophillus influenzae", "Streptococcus pneumoniae" and "Neisseria meningitides".

Bacterial abscesses rarely (if ever) arise "de novo" within the brain, although establishing a cause can be difficult in many cases. There is almost always a primary lesion elsewhere in the body that must be sought assiduously, because failure to treat the primary lesion will result in relapse. In cases of trauma, for example in compound skull fractures where fragments of bone are pushed into the substance of the brain, the cause of the abscess is obvious. Similarly, bullets and other foreign bodies may become sources of infection if left in place. The location of the primary lesion may be suggested by the location of the abscess: infections of the middle ear result in lesions in the <a href="middle%20cranial%20fossa">middle</a> and <a href="posterior%20cranial%20fossa">posterior</a> cranial fossae; congenital heart disease with right-to-left shunts often result in abscesses in the distribution of the <a href="middle%20cerebral%20artery">middle cerebral artery</a>; and infection of the <a href="frontal%20sinus">frontal</a> and <a href="ethmoid%20sinus">ethmoid</a> sinuses usually results in collection in the subdural sinuses.

<a href="fungus">Fungi</a> and <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s may also cause the disease. Fungi and parasites are especially associated with immunocompromised patients. Other causes include: "<a href="Nocardia%20asteroides">Nocardia asteroides</a>", "Mycobacterium", Fungi (e.g. "<a href="Aspergillus">Aspergillus</a>", "<a href="Candida%20%28fungus%29">Candida</a>", "<a href="Cryptococcus%20%28fungus%29">Cryptococcus</a>", "Mucorales", "Coccidioides", "<a href="Histoplasma%20capsulatum">Histoplasma capsulatum</a>", "<a href="Blastomyces%20dermatitidis">Blastomyces dermatitidis</a>", "Bipolaris", "<a href="Exophiala%20dermatitidis">Exophiala dermatitidis</a>", "<a href="Curvularia%20pallescens">Curvularia pallescens</a>", "Ochroconis gallopava", "Ramichloridium mackenziei", "<a href="Pseudallescheria%20boydii">Pseudallescheria boydii</a>"), Protozoa (e.g. "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>", "<a href="Entamoeba%20histolytica">Entamoeba histolytica</a>", "<a href="Trypanosoma%20cruzi">Trypanosoma cruzi</a>", "<a href="Schistosoma">Schistosoma</a>", "Paragonimus"), and Helminths (e.g. "Taenia solium"). Organisms that are most frequently associated with brain abscess in patients with <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> are <a href="poliovirus">poliovirus</a>, "Toxoplasma gondii", and "<a href="Cryptococcus%20neoformans">Cryptococcus neoformans</a>", though in infection with the latter organism, symptoms of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> generally predominate.

These organisms are associated with certain predisposing conditions: 

The diagnosis is established by a <a href="computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a> (CT) (with contrast) examination. At the initial phase of the inflammation (which is referred to as <a href="cerebrit">cerebrit</a>is), the immature lesion does not have a capsule and it may be difficult to distinguish it from other space-occupying lesions or infarcts of the brain. Within 4–5 days the inflammation and the concomitant dead brain tissue are surrounded with a capsule, which gives the lesion the famous <a href="ring-enhancing%20lesion">ring-enhancing lesion</a> appearance on CT examination with contrast (since intravenously applied contrast material can not pass through the capsule, it is collected around the lesion and looks as a ring surrounding the relatively dark lesion). <a href="Lumbar%20puncture">Lumbar puncture</a> procedure, which is performed in many infectious disorders of the central nervous system is contraindicated in this condition (as it is in all space-occupying lesions of the brain) because removing a certain portion of the <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a> may alter the concrete intracranial pressure balances and causes the brain tissue to move across structures within the skull (<a href="brain%20herniation">brain herniation</a>).

Ring enhancement may also be observed in cerebral hemorrhages (bleeding) and some brain <a href="tumor">tumor</a>s. However, in the presence of the rapidly progressive course with fever, focal neurologic findings (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.) and signs of increased intracranial pressure, the most likely diagnosis should be the brain abscess.

The treatment includes lowering the increased intracranial pressure and starting intravenous <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s (and meanwhile identifying the causative organism mainly by blood culture studies).

<a href="Hyperbaric%20medicine">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a> (HBO2 or HBOT) is indicated as a primary and adjunct treatment which provides four primary functions.
Firstly, HBOT reduces intracranial pressure. Secondly, high partial pressures of oxygen act as a bactericide and thus inhibits the anaerobic and functionally anaerobic flora common in brain abscess. Third, HBOT optimizes the immune function thus enhancing the host defense mechanisms and fourth, HBOT has been found to be of benefit when brain abscess is concomitant with cranial osteomyleitis.

Secondary functions of HBOT include increased stem cell production and up-regulation of VEGF which aid in the healing and recovery process.

Surgical drainage of the abscess remains part of the standard management of bacterial brain abscesses. The location and treatment of the primary lesion also crucial, as is the removal of any foreign material (bone, dirt, bullets, and so forth).

There are few exceptions to this rule: "<a href="Haemophilus%20influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a>" meningitis is often associated with subdural effusions that are mistaken for subdural empyemas. These effusions resolve with antibiotics and require no surgical treatment. <a href="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</a> can produce brain abscesses that look identical to conventional bacterial abscesses on CT imaging. Surgical drainage or aspiration is often necessary to identify "<a href="Mycobacterium%20tuberculosis">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a>", but once the diagnosis is made no further surgical intervention is necessary.

CT guided stereotactic aspiration is also indicated in the treatment of brain abscess.

Death occurs in about 10% of cases and people do well about 70% of the time. This is a large improvement from the 1960s due to improved ability to image the head, better neurosurgery and better antibiotics.

Brigitte Bardot

Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot (; born 28 September 1934) is a French actress, singer, dancer and fashion model, who later became an animal rights activist. She was one of the best known <a href="sex%20symbol">sex symbol</a>s of the 1950s and 1960s and was widely referred to by her initials, B.B.

Bardot was an aspiring ballerina in her early life. She started her acting career in 1952. After appearing in 16 routine comedy films that had limited international release, she became world-famous in 1957 after starring in the controversial film "<a href="And%20God%20Created%20Woman%20%281956%20film%29">And God Created Woman</a>". Bardot caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of <a href="Simone%20de%20Beauvoir">Simone de Beauvoir</a>'s 1959 essay, "The Lolita Syndrome", which described Bardot as a "locomotive of women's history" and built upon <a href="existentialist">existentialist</a> themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France. She later starred in <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>'s 1963 film "<a href="Contempt%20%28film%29">Le Mépris</a>". For her role in <a href="Louis%20Malle">Louis Malle</a>'s 1965 film "<a href="Viva%20Maria%21">Viva Maria!</a>" Bardot was nominated for a <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress</a>. From 1969 to 1978, Bardot was the official face of <a href="Marianne">Marianne</a> (who had previously been anonymous) to represent the liberty of France.

Bardot retired from the entertainment industry in 1973. During her career in show business, she starred in 47 films, performed in several musical shows and recorded over 60 songs. She was awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> in 1985 but refused to accept it. After her retirement, she established herself as an <a href="animal%20rights">animal rights</a> activist. During the 2000s, she generated controversy by criticizing immigration and <a href="Islam%20in%20France">Islam in France</a> and has been fined five times for <a href="Incitement%20to%20ethnic%20or%20racial%20hatred">inciting racial hatred</a>.

Bardot was born a brunette in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, the daughter of Louis Bardot (1896–1975) and Anne-Marie "Toty" Bardot (née Mucel; 1912–1978). Louis had an engineering degree and worked with his father, Charles Bardot, in the family business. Louis and Anne-Marie married in 1933. Bardot grew up in an upper middle-class <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> observant home. When she was seven she was admitted to the <a href="Cours%20Hattemer">Cours Hattemer</a>, a private school. She went to school three days a week, and otherwise studied at home. This gave time for lessons at Madame Bourget's dance studio three days a week.
Brigitte's mother also enrolled Brigitte's younger sister, Marie-Jeanne (born 5 May 1938), in dance. Marie-Jeanne eventually gave up dancing lessons and did not tell her mother, whereas Brigitte concentrated on ballet. In 1947, Bardot was accepted to the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a>. For three years she attended ballet classes by Russian choreographer Boris Knyazev. One of her classmates was <a href="Leslie%20Caron">Leslie Caron</a>. The other ballerinas nicknamed Bardot "Bichette" ("Little Doe").

At the invitation of an acquaintance of her mother, she modelled in a fashion show in 1949. In the same year, she modelled for a fashion magazine ""Jardin des Modes"" managed by journalist Hélène Lazareff. Aged 15, she appeared on an 8 March 1950 cover of "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" and was noticed by a young film director, <a href="Roger%20Vadim">Roger Vadim</a>, while babysitting. He showed an issue of the magazine to director and screenwriter <a href="Marc%20All%C3%A9gret">Marc Allégret</a>, who offered Bardot the opportunity to audition for "Les lauriers sont coupés". Although Bardot got the role, the film was cancelled but made her consider becoming an actress. Her relationship with Vadim, who attended the audition, influenced her further life and career.

Bardot debuted in a highly popular <a href="comedy%20film">comedy film</a> starring <a href="Bourvil">Bourvil</a>, "Le Trou Normand" (1952) (English title: "Crazy for Love"). 

She played the lead in "<a href="Manina%2C%20the%20Girl%20in%20the%20Bikini">Manina, the Girl in the Bikini</a>" (1953) from director <a href="Willy%20Rozier">Willy Rozier</a>. She had a small role in "<a href="The%20Long%20Teeth">The Long Teeth</a>" (1953), playing Vadim's wife, then had a leading role in a comedy starring <a href="Jean%20Richard">Jean Richard</a>, "<a href="His%20Father%27s%20Portrait">His Father's Portrait</a>" (1953).

Bardot had a small role in a Hollywood-financed film being shot in Paris, "<a href="Act%20of%20Love%20%281953%20film%29">Act of Love</a>" (1953), starring <a href="Kirk%20Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>. She received media attention when she attended the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> in April 1953.

Bardot had a leading role in an Italian melodrama, "<a href="Concert%20of%20Intrigue">Concert of Intrigue</a>" (1954) and in a French adventure film, "<a href="Caroline%20and%20the%20Rebels">Caroline and the Rebels</a>" (1954). She had a good part as a flirtatious student in "<a href="School%20for%20Love">School for Love</a>" (1955), opposite <a href="Jean%20Marais">Jean Marais</a> for director <a href="Marc%20Allegret">Marc Allegret</a>.

Bardot played her first sizeable English language role in "<a href="Doctor%20at%20Sea%20%28film%29">Doctor at Sea</a>" (1955), as the love interest for <a href="Dirk%20Bogarde">Dirk Bogarde</a>. The film was the third most popular movie at the British box office that year.

She had a small role in "<a href="The%20Grand%20Maneuver">The Grand Maneuver</a>" (1955) for director <a href="Rene%20Clair">Rene Clair</a>, supporting <a href="Gerard%20Philippe">Gerard Philippe</a> and <a href="Mich%C3%A8le%20Morgan">Michelle Morgan</a>. The part was bigger in "<a href="The%20Light%20Across%20the%20Street">The Light Across the Street</a>" (1956) for director <a href="Georges%20Lacombe%20%28director%29">Georges Lacombe</a>. She did another with Hollywood film, "<a href="Helen%20of%20Troy%20%28film%29">Helen of Troy</a>", playing Helen's handmaiden.
For the 1956 Italian movie <a href="Nero%27s%20Weekend">"Mio figlio Nerone"</a> Bardot was asked by the director to appear as a blonde. Rather than wear a wig to hide her naturally brunette hair she decided to dye her hair. She was so pleased with the results that she decided to retain the hair colour.

Bardot then appeared in four movies that made her a star. First up was a musical, "<a href="Naughty%20Girl%20%28film%29">Naughty Girl</a>" (1956), where Bardot played a troublesome school girl. Directed by <a href="Michel%20Boisrond">Michel Boisrond</a>, it was co-written by Roger Vadim and was a big hit, the 12th most popular film of the year in France. It was followed by a comedy, "<a href="Plucking%20the%20Daisy">Plucking the Daisy</a>" (1956), written by Vadim with the director Marc Allegret, and another success at France. So too was the comedy "<a href="The%20Bride%20Is%20Much%20Too%20Beautiful">The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful</a>" (1956) with <a href="Louis%20Jourdan">Louis Jourdan</a>.

Finally there was the melodrama "<a href="And%20God%20Created%20Woman%20%281956%20film%29">And God Created Woman</a>" (1956), Vadim's debut as director, with Bardot starring opposite <a href="Jean-Louis%20Trintignant">Jean-Louis Trintignant</a> and <a href="Curt%20Jurgens">Curt Jurgens</a>. The film, about an immoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was a huge success, not just in France but also around the world - it was among the ten most popular films in Britain in 1957. It turned Bardot into an international star. In 1958 the moniker "<a href="sex%20kitten">sex kitten</a>" was invented for her.

During her early career, professional photographer Sam Lévin's photos contributed to her image of Bardot's sensuality. One showed Bardot from behind, dressed in a white corset. British photographer <a href="Cornel%20Lucas">Cornel Lucas</a> made images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s, that have become representative of her public persona.

Bardot followed "And God Created Woman" with "<a href="La%20Parisienne%20%28film%29">La Parisienne</a>" (1957), a comedy co-starring <a href="Charles%20Boyer">Charles Boyer</a> for director Boisrond. She was reunited with Vadim in another melodrama "<a href="The%20Night%20Heaven%20Fell">The Night Heaven Fell</a>" (1958) and played a criminal who seduced <a href="Jean%20Gabin">Jean Gabin</a> in "<a href="In%20Case%20of%20Adversity">In Case of Adversity</a>" (1958). The latter was the 13th most seen movie of the year in France. 

"<a href="The%20Female%20%281959%20film%29">The Female</a>" (1959) for director <a href="Julien%20Duvivier">Julien Duvivier</a> was popular, but "<a href="Babette%20Goes%20to%20War">Babette Goes to War</a>" (1959), a comedy set in World War Two, was a huge hit, the fourth biggest movie of the year in France. Also widely seen was "<a href="Come%20Dance%20with%20Me%20%281959%20film%29">Come Dance with Me</a>" (1959) from Boisrond.

Her next film was the courtroom drama "<a href="The%20Truth%20%281960%20film%29">The Truth</a>" (1960), from <a href="Henri-Georges%20Clouzot">Henri-Georges Clouzot</a>. It was a highly publicised production, which resulted in Bardot having an affair and attempting suicide. The film was Bardot's biggest ever commercial success in France, the third biggest hit of the year, and was nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar.

She made a comedy with Vadim, "<a href="Please%2C%20Not%20Now%21">Please, Not Now!</a>" (1961) and had a role in the all-star anthology, "<a href="Famous%20Love%20Affairs">Famous Love Affairs</a>" (1962).

Bardot was awarded a <a href="David%20di%20Donatello">David di Donatello Award</a> for Best Foreign actress for her role in "<a href="A%20Very%20Private%20Affair">A Very Private Affair</a>" ("Vie privée", 1962), directed by <a href="Louis%20Malle">Louis Malle</a>. More popular in France was "<a href="Love%20on%20a%20Pillow">Love on a Pillow</a>" (1962), another for Vadim.

In the mid-1960s Bardot made films which seemed to be more aimed at the international market. In 1963, she starred in <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>'s film "<a href="Contempt%20%28film%29">Le Mépris</a>", produced by <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Levine">Joseph E. Levine</a> and starring <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a>. The following year she co-starred with <a href="Anthony%20Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a> in the comedy "<a href="Une%20ravissante%20idiote">Une ravissante idiote</a>" (1964).

Bardot finally appeared in a Hollywood film in "<a href="Dear%20Brigitte">Dear Brigitte</a>" (1965), a comedy starring <a href="James%20Stewart">James Stewart</a> as an academic whose son develops a crush on Bardot. Bardot's appearance was relatively brief and the film was not a big hit.

More successful was the Western buddy comedy "<a href="Viva%20Maria%21">Viva Maria!</a>" (1965) for director Louis Malle, appearing opposite <a href="Jeanne%20Moreau">Jeanne Moreau</a>. It was a big hit in France and around the world although it did not break through in the US as much as was hoped.

After a cameo in Godard's, "<a href="Masculin%20F%C3%A9minin">Masculin Féminin</a>" (1966) she had her first flop in a long time, "<a href="Two%20Weeks%20in%20September">Two Weeks in September</a>" (1968), a French-English co production. She had a small role in the all-star "<a href="Spirits%20of%20the%20Dead">Spirits of the Dead</a>" (1968), acting opposite <a href="Alain%20Delon">Alain Delon</a>, then tried a Hollywood film again: "<a href="Shalako%20%28film%29">Shalako</a>" (1968), a Western starring <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a>, which was a box office disappointment.

"<a href="Les%20Femmes">Les Femmes</a>" (1969) was a flop, although the screwball comedy "<a href="The%20Bear%20and%20the%20Doll">The Bear and the Doll</a>" (1970) performed slightly better. Her last few films were mostly comedies: "<a href="Les%20Novices">Les Novices</a>" (1970), "<a href="Boulevard%20du%20Rhum">Boulevard du Rhum</a>" (1971) (with <a href="Lino%20Ventura">Lino Ventura</a>). "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Frenchie%20King">The Legend of Frenchie King</a>" (1971) was more popular, helped by Bardot co-starring with <a href="Claudia%20Cardinale">Claudia Cardinale</a>. She made one more with Vadim, "<a href="Don%20Juan%2C%20or%20If%20Don%20Juan%20Were%20a%20Woman">Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman</a>" (1973), playing the title role. Vadim said the film marked "Underneath what people call "the Bardot myth" was something interesting, even though she was never considered the most professional actress in the world. For years, since she has been growing older, and the Bardot myth has become just a souvenir... I was curious in her as a woman and I had to get to the end of something with her, to get out of her and express many things I felt were in her. Brigitte always gave the impression of sexual freedom - she is a completely open and free person, without any aggression. So I gave her the part of a man - that amused me.

"If "Don Juan" is not my last movie it will be my next to last," said Bardot during filming. She kept her word and only made one more film, "<a href="The%20Edifying%20and%20Joyous%20Story%20of%20Colinot">The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot</a>" (1973).

Her career had traversed epochs where it was possible to say, "In the Sixties and early Seventies, there was no better known – or more scandalous – movie star on earth. — Not since the death of Valentino had a star aroused such insane devotion in their fans." In 1973, Bardot announced she was retiring from acting as "a way to get out elegantly".

She participated in several musical shows and recorded many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly in collaboration with <a href="Serge%20Gainsbourg">Serge Gainsbourg</a>, Bob Zagury and <a href="Sacha%20Distel">Sacha Distel</a>, including "Harley Davidson"; "Je Me Donne À Qui Me Plaît"; "Bubble gum"; "Contact"; "Je Reviendrai Toujours Vers Toi"; "L'Appareil À Sous"; "La Madrague"; "On Déménage"; "Sidonie"; "Tu Veux, Ou Tu Veux Pas?"; "Le Soleil De Ma Vie" (the cover of <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>'s "<a href="You%20Are%20the%20Sunshine%20of%20My%20Life">You Are the Sunshine of My Life</a>"); and the notorious "Je t'aime... moi non-plus". Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release this duet and he complied with her wishes; the following year, he rerecorded a version with British-born model and actress <a href="Jane%20Birkin">Jane Birkin</a> that became a massive hit all over Europe. The version with Bardot was issued in 1986 and became a popular download hit in 2006 when <a href="Universal%20Music">Universal Music</a> made its back catalogue available to purchase online, with this version of the song ranking as the third most popular download.

In 1973, before her 39th birthday, Bardot announced her retirement. After appearing in more than forty motion pictures and recording several music albums, most notably with <a href="Serge%20Gainsbourg">Serge Gainsbourg</a>, she used her fame to promote <a href="animal%20rights">animal rights</a>.

In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals. She became a vegetarian and raised three million francs to fund the foundation by auctioning off jewellery and personal belongings.

She is a strong animal rights activist and a major opponent of the consumption of <a href="horse%20meat">horse meat</a>. In support of animal protection, she condemned <a href="seal%20hunting%20in%20Canada">seal hunting in Canada</a> during a visit to that country with <a href="Paul%20Watson">Paul Watson</a> of the <a href="Sea%20Shepherd%20Conservation%20Society">Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</a>. On 25 May 2011 the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society renamed its fast interceptor vessel, MV "Gojira", as <a href="MV%20Brigitte%20Bardot">MV "Brigitte Bardot"</a> in appreciation of her support.

She once had a neighbour's donkey castrated while looking after it, on the grounds of its "sexual harassment" of her own donkey and mare, for which she was taken to court by the donkey's owner in 1989. Bardot wrote a 1999 letter to Chinese President <a href="Jiang%20Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a>, published in French magazine VSD, in which she accused the Chinese of "torturing bears and killing the world's last tigers and rhinos to make <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a>s".

She has donated more than $140,000 over two years for a mass <a href="animal%20sterilization">sterilization</a> and adoption program for <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>'s <a href="Free-ranging%20urban%20dog">stray dogs</a>, estimated to number 300,000.

In August 2010, Bardot addressed a letter to the Queen of Denmark, <a href="Margrethe%20II%20of%20Denmark">Margrethe II of Denmark</a>, appealing for the sovereign to halt the <a href="Whaling%20in%20the%20Faroe%20Islands">killing of dolphins</a> in the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>. In the letter, Bardot describes the activity as a "macabre spectacle" that "is a shame for Denmark and the Faroe Islands ... This is not a hunt but a mass slaughter ... an outmoded tradition that has no acceptable justification in today's world".

On 22 April 2011, French culture minister <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Mitterrand">Frédéric Mitterrand</a> officially included bullfighting in the country's cultural heritage. Bardot wrote him a highly critical letter of protest.

From 2013 onwards the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in collaboration with Kagyupa International Monlam Trust of India has operated annual Veterinary Care Camp. She has committed to the cause of animal welfare in Bodhgaya year after year.

On 23 July 2015, Brigitte Bardot condemned <a href="Greg%20Hunt">Greg Hunt</a>'s plan to eradicate 2 million cats to save endangered species such as <a href="Black-flanked%20rock-wallaby">Warru</a> and <a href="Night%20parrot">Night Parrot</a>.

In May 1958, Bardot withdrew to the seclusion of <a href="Southern%20France">Southern France</a>, where she had bought the house "La Madrague" in <a href="Saint-Tropez">Saint-Tropez</a>.

On 21 December 1952, aged 18, Bardot married director <a href="Roger%20Vadim">Roger Vadim</a>. They divorced in 1957, after less than five years of marriage; they had no children together, but remained in touch, and even collaborated on later projects. The stated reason for the divorce was Bardot's affair with two other men. While married to Vadim, Bardot had an affair with <a href="Jean-Louis%20Trintignant">Jean-Louis Trintignant</a>, who was her co-star in "And God Created Woman." Trintignant was also a married man, being at the time married to actress <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Audran">Stéphane Audran</a>. The two lived together for about two years, spanning the period before and after Bardot's divorce from Vadim, but they never married. Their relationship was complicated by Trintignant's frequent absence due to <a href="military%20service">military service</a> and Bardot's affair with musician <a href="Gilbert%20B%C3%A9caud">Gilbert Bécaud</a>. 

In early 1958, after her divorce from Vadim, it was followed in quick order by her break-up with Trintignant and Bardot suffered a reported nervous breakdown in Italy, according to newspaper reports. A suicide attempt with sleeping pills two days earlier was also noted, but was denied by her public relations manager. She recovered within weeks and then began an affair with the actor <a href="Jacques%20Charrier">Jacques Charrier</a>. She became pregnant well before they were married on 18 June 1959. Bardot's only child, her son Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, was born on 11 January 1960. After she and Charrier divorced in 1962, Nicolas was raised in the Charrier family and had little contact with his biological mother until his adulthood.

Bardot's third marriage was to German millionaire playboy <a href="Gunter%20Sachs">Gunter Sachs</a>, and it lasted from 14 July 1966 to 1 October 1969. In 1968, she began dating Patrick Gilles, who went on to costar with her in "<a href="The%20Bear%20and%20the%20Doll">The Bear and the Doll</a>" (1970); but she ended their relationship in the spring of 1971. 

Over the next few years, Bardot dated in succession the bartender/ski instructor Christian Kalt; club owner Luigi Rizzi; musician (later producer) Bob Zagury; singer <a href="Serge%20Gainsbourg">Serge Gainsbourg</a>; writer <a href="John%20Gilmore%20%28writer%29">John Gilmore</a>; actor <a href="Warren%20Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, and Laurent Vergez, who was her co-star in "<a href="Don%20Juan%2C%20or%20If%20Don%20Juan%20Were%20a%20Woman">Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman</a>". The longest of these casual relationships was with sculptor Miroslav Brozek. She lived with him from 1975 to December 1979, posed for some of his sculptures. After breaking up with Brozek, she was involved in a long-term relationship with French TV producer Allain Bougrain-duBourg.

Bardot's fourth and current husband is Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser of <a href="Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>, former leader of the far right party Front National; they were married on 16 August 1992.

In 1974, Bardot appeared in a nude photo shoot in "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine, which celebrated her 40th birthday. On 28 September 1983, her 49th birthday, Bardot took an overdose of sleeping pills or tranquilizers with red wine. She had to be rushed to hospital, where her life was saved after a <a href="stomach%20pump">stomach pump</a> was used to evacuate the pills from her body. Bardot is also a breast cancer survivor.

Bardot expressed support for President <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> in the 1960s. Her husband Bernard d'Ormale is a former adviser of the <a href="Front%20National%20%28France%29">Front National</a>, the main far right party in France, known for its nationalist and conservative beliefs.

In her 1999 book "Le Carré de Pluton" (""Pluto's Square""), Bardot criticizes the procedure used in the <a href="ritual%20slaughter">ritual slaughter</a> of sheep during the Muslim festival of <a href="Eid%20al-Adha">Eid al-Adha</a>. Additionally, in a section in the book entitled, "Open Letter to My Lost France", Bardot writes that ""my country, France, my homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims"". For this comment, a French court fined her 30,000 francs in June 2000. She had been fined in 1997 for the original publication of this open letter in "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" and again in 1998 for making similar remarks.

In her 2003 book, "Un cri dans le silence" (""A Scream in the Silence""), she warned of an "<a href="Islamicization">Islamicization</a> of France", and said of Muslim immigration:
Over the last twenty years, we have given in to a subterranean, dangerous, and uncontrolled infiltration, which not only resists adjusting to our laws and customs but which will, as the years pass, attempt to impose its own.

In the book, she contrasted her close gay friends with today's homosexuals, who "jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly heteros put them through" and that some contemporary homosexuals behave like "fairground freaks". In her own defence, Bardot wrote in a letter to a French gay magazine: "Apart from my husband — who maybe will cross over one day as well — I am entirely surrounded by homos. For years, they have been my support, my friends, my adopted children, my confidants."

In her book she wrote about issues such as racial mixing, immigration, the role of women in politics and Islam. The book also contained a section attacking what she called the mixing of genes and praised previous generations who, she said, had given their lives to push out invaders.

On 10 June 2004, Bardot was convicted for a fourth time by a French court for "inciting racial hatred" and fined €5,000. Bardot denied the racial hatred charge and apologized in court, saying: "I never knowingly wanted to hurt anybody. It is not in my character."

In 2008, Bardot was convicted of inciting racial/religious hatred in relation to a letter she wrote, a copy of which she sent to <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> when he was <a href="Interior%20Minister%20of%20France">Interior Minister of France</a>. The letter stated her objections to Muslims in France <a href="Dhabihah">ritually slaughtering sheep</a> by slitting their throats without anesthetizing them first. She also said, in reference to Muslims, that she was "fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its habits". The trial concluded on 3 June 2008, with a conviction and fine of €15,000, the largest of her fines to date. The prosecutor stated that she was tired of charging Bardot with offences related to racial hatred.

During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">2008 United States presidential election</a>, she branded the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> vice-presidential candidate <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a> as "stupid" and a "disgrace to women". She criticized the former governor of Alaska for her stance on <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a> and <a href="gun%20control">gun control</a>. She was also offended by Palin's support for Arctic oil exploration and for her lack of consideration in protecting <a href="polar%20bears">polar bears</a>.

On 13 August 2010, Bardot lashed out at director <a href="Kyle%20Newman">Kyle Newman</a> regarding his plan to make a biographical film on her life. She told him, "Wait until I'm dead before you make a movie about my life!" otherwise "sparks will fly".

In fashion, the Bardot neckline (a wide open neck that exposes both shoulders) is named after her. Bardot popularized this style which is especially used for knitted sweaters or jumpers although it is also used for other tops and dresses. Bardot popularized the <a href="bikini">bikini</a> in her early films such as "<a href="Manina%2C%20the%20Girl%20in%20the%20Bikini">Manina</a>" (1952) (released in France as "Manina, la fille sans voiles"). The following year she was also photographed in a bikini on every beach in the south of France during the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. She gained additional attention when she filmed "<a href="And%20God%20Created%20Woman%20%281956%20film%29">...And God Created Woman</a>" (1956) with <a href="Jean-Louis%20Trintignant">Jean-Louis Trintignant</a> (released in France as "Et Dieu Créa La Femme"). Bardot portrayed an immoral teenager cavorting in a bikini who seduces men in a respectable small-town setting. The film was an international success. The bikini was in the 1950s relatively well accepted in France but was still considered risqué in the United States. As late as 1959, Anne Cole, one of the United States' largest swimsuit designers, said, "It's nothing more than a G-string. It's at the razor's edge of decency."

She also brought into fashion the "<a href="choucroute">choucroute</a>" ("Sauerkraut") hairstyle (a sort of <a href="beehive%20%28hairstyle%29">beehive hair style</a>) and <a href="gingham">gingham</a> clothes after wearing a checkered pink dress, designed by Jacques Esterel, at her wedding to Charrier. She was the subject for an <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> painting. 

The Bardot pose describes an iconic modeling portrait shot around 1960 where Bardot is dressed only in a pair of black <a href="pantyhose">pantyhose</a>, cross-legged over her front and cross-armed over her breasts. This pose has been emulated numerous times by models and celebrities such as <a href="Lindsay%20Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, <a href="Elle%20Macpherson">Elle Macpherson</a> and <a href="Monica%20Bellucci">Monica Bellucci</a>.

The Australian pop group <a href="Bardot%20%28Australian%20band%29">Bardot</a> was named after her.

In addition to popularizing the bikini swimming suit, Bardot has been credited with popularizing the city of <a href="St.%20Tropez">St. Tropez</a> and the town of <a href="Arma%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20dos%20B%C3%BAzios">Armação dos Búzios</a> in Brazil, which she visited in 1964 with her boyfriend at the time, Brazilian musician Bob Zagury. The place where she stayed in Búzios is today a small hotel, Pousada do Sol, and also a French restaurant, Cigalon. The town hosts a Bardot statue by Christina Motta.

Bardot was idolized by the young <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> and <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. They made plans to shoot a film featuring <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> and Bardot, similar to "<a href="A%20Hard%20Day%27s%20Night%20%28film%29">A Hard Day's Night</a>", but the plans were never fulfilled. Lennon's first wife <a href="Cynthia%20Powell">Cynthia Powell</a> lightened her hair color to more closely resemble Bardot, while <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a> made comparisons between Bardot and his first wife <a href="Pattie%20Boyd">Pattie Boyd</a>, as Cynthia wrote later in "A Twist of Lennon". Lennon and Bardot met in person once, in 1968 at the Mayfair Hotel, introduced by Beatles press agent <a href="Derek%20Taylor">Derek Taylor</a>; a nervous Lennon took <a href="Lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD</a> before arriving, and neither star impressed the other. (Lennon recalled in a memoir, "I was on acid, and she was on her way out.") According to the liner notes of his first (self-titled) album, musician <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> dedicated the first song he ever wrote to Bardot. He also mentioned her by name in "I Shall Be Free", which appeared on his second album, "<a href="The%20Freewheelin%27%20Bob%20Dylan">The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</a>". The first-ever official exhibition spotlighting Bardot's influence and legacy opened in Paris on 29 September 2009 – a day after her 75th birthday.

Bardot released several albums and singles during the 1960s and 1970s

Bardot has also written five books:

Banjo

The banjo is a four-, five- or six-stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity as a resonator, called the head. The membrane, or head, is typically made of plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally but rarely used, and the frame is typically circular. Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by <a href="Africa">Africa</a>ns in <a href="United%20States">America</a>, adapted from African instruments of similar design.

The banjo is frequently associated with <a href="country%20music">country</a>, <a href="folk%20music">folk</a>, <a href="Folk%20music%20of%20Ireland">Irish traditional</a>, and <a href="bluegrass%20music">bluegrass music</a>. Historically, the banjo occupied a central place in <a href="African%20American%20music">African American traditional music</a>, before becoming popular in the <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrel show</a>s of the 19th century. The banjo, with the fiddle, is a mainstay of American <a href="old-time%20music">old-time music</a>. It is also very frequently used in <a href="Trad%20jazz">Traditional ("Trad") Jazz</a>.

The modern banjo derives from instruments that had been used in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> since the 17th century by enslaved people taken from <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. Written references to the banjo in North America appear in the 18th century, and the instrument became increasingly available commercially from around the second quarter of the 19th century. 

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the name "banjo" is uncertain. The word could have come from the <a href="Yoruba%20people">Yoruba</a> word "Bami jo," which means "dance for me." It may derive from the <a href="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a> word "mbanza". Some etymologists believe it comes from a <a href="dialect">dialect</a>al pronunciation of the Portuguese "<a href="bandora%20%28instrument%29">bandore</a>" or from an early anglicisation of the Spanish word "<a href="bandurria">bandurria</a>", though other research suggests that it may come from a West African term for a <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> stick formerly used for the instrument's neck.

A Banza: a five double string courses Portuguese vihuela with two short strings. Mbanza is a string African instrument that has been built after the Portuguese Banza. "Banza" is quite similar to "Banjo".

Various instruments in <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, chief among them the <a href="Kora%20%28instrument%29">kora</a>, feature a <a href="skin">skin</a> <a href="Drumhead">head</a> and gourd (or similar shell) body. The African instruments differ from early <a href="African%20American">African American</a> banjos in that the necks do not possess a Western-style fingerboard and tuning pegs, instead having stick necks, with strings attached to the neck with loops for tuning. Banjos with fingerboards and tuning pegs are known from the Caribbean as early as the 17th century. 18th- and early 19th-century writers transcribed the name of these instruments variously as "bangie", "banza", "bonjaw", "banjer" and "banjar". Instruments similar to the banjo (e.g., the Japanese "<a href="shamisen">shamisen</a>", Persian "<a href="Tar%20%28lute%29">tar</a>", and Moroccan "<a href="sintir">sintir</a>") have been played in many countries. Another likely relative of the banjo is the "<a href="akonting">akonting</a>", a spike folk lute played by the <a href="Jola%20people">Jola tribe</a> of <a href="Senegambia%20%28geography%29">Senegambia</a>, and the "ubaw-akwala" of the <a href="Ibo%20people">Igbo</a>. Similar instruments include the "<a href="xalam">xalam</a>" of <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> and the "<a href="Ngoni%20%28instrument%29">ngoni</a>" of the <a href="Wassoulou">Wassoulou</a> region including parts of <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>, and <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, as well as a larger variation of the "ngoni" developed in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> by sub-Saharan Africans known as the "gimbri".

Early, African-influenced banjos were built around a <a href="gourd">gourd</a> body and a wooden stick neck. These instruments had varying numbers of strings, though often including some form of drone. The five-string banjo was popularized by <a href="Joel%20Walker%20Sweeney">Joel Walker Sweeney</a>, an American <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrel</a> performer from <a href="Appomattox%20Court%20House%20National%20Historical%20Park">Appomattox Court House</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>.

In the 1830s Sweeney became the first white performer to play the banjo on stage. His version of the instrument replaced the gourd with a drum-like sound box and included four full-length strings alongside a short fifth string. This new banjo was at first tuned d'Gdf♯a, though by the 1890s this had been transposed up to g'cgbd'. Banjos were introduced in Britain by Sweeney's group, the American <a href="Virginia%20Minstrels">Virginia Minstrels</a>, in the 1840s and became very popular in music halls.

In the <a href="Antebellum%20South">Antebellum South</a>, many black slaves played the banjo and taught their masters how to play. For example, in his memoir titled "With Sabre and Scalpel: The Autobiography of a Soldier and Surgeon", Confederate veteran and surgeon <a href="John%20Allan%20Wyeth">John Allan Wyeth</a> recalls learning it from a slave as a child on his family plantation.

Two techniques closely associated with the five-string banjo are <a href="banjo%20roll">rolls</a> and <a href="drone%20%28music%29">drones</a>. Rolls are right hand <a href="accompaniment">accompaniment</a>al fingering pattern[s] that consist of eight (eighth) notes that <a href="subdivision%20%28music%29">subdivide</a> each <a href="bar%20%28music%29">measure</a>. Drone notes are quick little notes [typically eighth notes], usually played on the 5th (short) string to fill in around the melody notes [typically eighth notes]. These techniques are both <a href="instrumental%20idiom">idiomatic</a> to the banjo in all styles, and their sound is characteristic of bluegrass.

Historically, the banjo was played in the <a href="clawhammer">clawhammer</a> style by the Africans who brought their version of the banjo with them. Several other styles of play were developed from this. Clawhammer consists of downward striking of one or more of the four main strings with the index, middle or both finger(s)while the drone or fifth string is played with a 'lifting' (as opposed to downward pluck) motion of the thumb. The notes typically sounded by the thumb in this fashion are, usually, on the off beat. Melodies can be quite intricate adding techniques such as double thumbing and drop thumb. In old time Appalachian Mountain music, there is also a style called two finger up-pick, and a three finger version that <a href="Earl%20Scruggs">Earl Scruggs</a> developed into the famous "Scruggs" style picking, nationally aired in 1945 on the <a href="Grand%20Ole%20Opry">Grand Ole Opry</a>.

While five-string banjos are traditionally played with either fingerpicks or the fingers themselves, <a href="Banjo%23Tenor%20banjo">tenor banjo</a>s and <a href="plectrum%20banjo">plectrum banjo</a>s are played with a pick, either to strum full chords or, most commonly in <a href="Irish%20Traditional%20Music">Irish Traditional Music</a>, play single note melodies.

The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a <a href="guitar">guitar</a>, has gained popularity. In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast <a href="arpeggiated">arpeggiated</a> plucking, though there are many different playing styles.

The body, or "pot", of a modern banjo typically consists of a circular rim (generally made of wood, though metal was also common on older banjos) and a tensioned head, similar to a drum head. Traditionally the head was made from animal skin, but today is often made of various synthetic materials. Most modern banjos also have a metal "tone ring" assembly that helps further clarify and project the sound, however many older banjos do not include a tone ring.

The banjo is usually tuned with friction <a href="tuning%20peg">tuning peg</a>s or <a href="planetary%20gear">planetary gear</a> tuners, rather than the <a href="worm%20gear">worm gear</a> <a href="machine%20head">machine head</a> used on guitars. Frets have become standard since the late 19th century, though fretless banjos are still manufactured and played by those wishing to execute <a href="glissando">glissando</a>, play quarter tones, or otherwise achieve the sound and feeling of early playing styles.

Modern banjos are typically strung with metal strings. Usually the fourth string is <a href="Strings%20%28music%29%23Winding">wound</a> with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. Some players may string their banjos with nylon or gut strings to achieve a more mellow, old-time tone.

Some banjos have a separate resonator plate on the back of the pot to project the sound forward and give the instrument more volume. This type of banjo is usually used in <a href="bluegrass%20music">bluegrass music</a>, though resonator banjos are played by players of all styles, and are also used in old-time, sometimes as a substitute for electric amplification when playing in large venues.

Open-back banjos generally have a mellower tone and weigh less than resonator banjos. They usually have a different setup than a resonator banjo, often with a higher <a href="Action%20%28music%29">string action</a>.

The modern five-string banjo is a variation on Sweeney's original design. The fifth string is usually the same gauge as the first, but starts from the fifth fret, three quarters the length of the other strings. This lets the string be tuned to a higher open pitch than possible for the full-length strings. Because of the short fifth string, the five-string banjo uses a <a href="reentrant%20tuning">reentrant tuning</a>—the string pitches don't proceed lowest to highest across the fingerboard. Instead, the fourth string is lowest, then third, second, first, and the fifth string is highest.

The short fifth string presents special problems for a <a href="capo">capo</a>. For small changes (going up or down one or two semitones, for example) it is possible simply to re-tune the fifth string. Otherwise, various devices called "fifth string capos" effectively shorten the vibrating part of the string. Many banjo players use model railroad spikes or titanium spikes (usually installed at the seventh fret and sometimes at others), that they hook the string under to press it down on the <a href="fret">fret</a>.

Five-string banjo players use many tunings. Probably the most common, particularly in bluegrass, is the Open-G tuning G4 D3 G3 B3 D4. In earlier times, the tuning G4 C3 G3 B3 D4 was commonly used instead, and this is still the preferred tuning for some types of folk music and for <a href="classic%20banjo">classic banjo</a>. Other tunings found in old-time music include double C (G4 C3 G3 C4 D4), "sawmill" (G4 D3 G3 C4 D4) also called "mountain modal" and open D (F#4D3 F#3 A3 D4). These tunings are often taken up a tone, either by tuning up or using a <a href="capo">capo</a>. For example, "old-time D" tuning (A4 D3 A3 D4 E4) – commonly reached by tuning up from double C – is often played to accompany fiddle tunes in the key of D and Open-A (A4 E3 A3 C#4 E4) is usually used for playing tunes in the key of A. There are dozens of other banjo tunings, used mostly in old-time music. These tunings are used to make it easier to play specific, usually, fiddle tunes, or groups of fiddle tunes.

The size of the five-string banjo is largely standardized—but smaller and larger sizes exist, including the long-neck or "Seeger neck" variation designed by <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>. Petite variations on the five-string banjo have been available since the 1890s. S.S. Stewart introduced the <a href="banjeaurine">banjeaurine</a>, tuned one fourth above a standard five-string. Piccolo banjos are smaller, and tuned one octave above a standard banjo. Between these sizes and standard lies the A-scale banjo, which is two frets shorter and usually tuned one full step above standard tunings. Many makers have produced banjos of other scale lengths, and with various innovations.

American <a href="old-time%20music">old-time music</a> typically uses the five-string open back banjo. It is played in a number of different styles, the most common being <a href="clawhammer">clawhammer</a> or frailing, characterized by the use of a downward rather than upward stroke when striking the strings with a fingernail. Frailing techniques use the thumb to catch the fifth string for a <a href="drone%20%28music%29">drone</a> after most <a href="strums">strums</a> or after each stroke ("double thumbing"), or to pick out additional melody notes in what is known as "drop-thumb." <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a> popularised a <a href="Folk%20music">folk</a> style by combining clawhammer with "up picking", usually without the use of <a href="fingerpick">fingerpick</a>s. Another common style of old-time banjo playing is "Fingerpicking banjo" or "classic banjo". This style is based upon <a href="parlor-style%20guitar">parlor-style guitar</a>.

<a href="Bluegrass%20music">Bluegrass music</a>, which uses the five-string resonator banjo almost exclusively, is played in several common styles. These include <a href="Scruggs%20style">Scruggs style</a>, named after <a href="Earl%20Scruggs">Earl Scruggs</a>; melodic, or <a href="Keith%20style">Keith style</a>, named for <a href="Bill%20Keith%20%28musician%29">Bill Keith</a>; and three-finger style with single string work, also called Reno style after <a href="Don%20Reno">Don Reno</a>. In these styles the emphasis is on arpeggiated figures played in a continuous eighth-note rhythm, known as <a href="banjo%20roll">rolls</a>. All of these styles are typically played with <a href="fingerpick">fingerpick</a>s.

The first five-string electric solid-body banjo was developed by <a href="Buck%20Trent">Charles (Buck) Wilburn Trent</a>, Harold "Shot" Jackson, and David Jackson in 1960.

The five-string banjo has been used in classical music since before the turn of the 20th century. <a href="contemporary%20classical%20music">Contemporary and modern</a> works have been written or arranged for the instrument by <a href="Jerry%20Garcia">Jerry Garcia</a>, <a href="Buck%20Trent">Buck Trent</a>, <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Fleck">Béla Fleck</a>, <a href="Tony%20Trischka">Tony Trischka</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Stanley">Ralph Stanley</a>, <a href="Steve%20Martin">Steve Martin</a>, <a href="George%20Crumb">George Crumb</a>, <a href="Modest%20Mouse">Modest Mouse</a>, <a href="Jo%20Kondo">Jo Kondo</a>, <a href="Paul%20Elwood">Paul Elwood</a>, <a href="Hans%20Werner%20Henze">Hans Werner Henze</a> (notably in his <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Henze%29">Sixth Symphony</a>), Daniel Mason of <a href="Hank%20Williams%20III">Hank Williams III</a>'s Damn Band, <a href="Beck">Beck</a>, <a href="the%20Water%20Tower%20Bucket%20Boys">the Water Tower Bucket Boys</a>, <a href="Todd%20Taylor%20%28banjo%20player%29">Todd Taylor</a>, <a href="J.P.%20Pickens">J.P.

<a href="Frederick%20Delius">Frederick Delius</a> wrote for a banjo in his opera <a href="Koanga">Koanga</a>.

<a href="Ernst%20Krenek">Ernst Krenek</a> includes two banjos in his Kleine Symphonie (Little Symphony).

<a href="Kurt%20Weill">Kurt Weill</a> has a banjo in his opera <a href="The%20Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Mahagonny">The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny</a>.

Four-string banjos, both plectrum and tenor, can be used for chordal accompaniment (as in early jazz), for single string melody playing (as in Irish traditional music), in "chord melody" style (a succession of chords in which the highest notes carry the melody), in tremolo style (both on chords and single strings), and a mixed technique called duo style that combines single string tremolo and rhythm chords.

The plectrum banjo is a standard banjo without the short drone string. It usually has 22 frets on the neck and a scale length of 26 to 28 inches, and was originally tuned C3 G3 B3 D4. It can also be tuned like the top four strings of a guitar, which is known as "Chicago tuning." As the name suggests, it is usually played with a guitar-style <a href="plectrum">pick</a> (that is, a single one held between thumb and forefinger), unlike the five-string banjo, which is either played with a <a href="thumbpick">thumbpick</a> and two fingerpicks, or with bare fingers. The plectrum banjo evolved out of the five-string banjo, to cater to styles of music involving strummed chords. The plectrum is also featured in many early jazz recordings and arrangements.

The four-string banjo is used from time to time in musical theater. Examples include: "<a href="Hello%2C%20Dolly%21%20%28musical%29">Hello, Dolly!</a>", "<a href="Mame%20%28musical%29">Mame</a>", "<a href="Chicago%20%28musical%29">Chicago</a>", "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>", "<a href="Oklahoma%21">Oklahoma!</a>", "<a href="Half%20a%20Sixpence">Half a Sixpence</a>", "<a href="Annie%20%28musical%29">Annie</a>", "<a href="Barnum%20%28musical%29">Barnum</a>", "<a href="The%20Threepenny%20Opera">The Threepenny Opera</a>", "<a href="Monty%20Python%27s%20Spamalot">Monty Python's Spamalot</a>", and countless others. <a href="Joe%20Raposo">Joe Raposo</a> had used it variably in the imaginative 7-piece orchestration for the long-running TV show "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>", and has sometimes had it overdubbed with itself or an <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>. The banjo is still (albeit rarely) in use in the show's arrangement currently.

The shorter-necked, tenor banjo, with 17 ("short scale") or 19 frets, is also typically played with a plectrum. It became a popular instrument after about 1910. Early models used for melodic picking typically had 17 frets on the neck and a scale length of 19½ to 21½ inches. By the mid-1920s, when the instrument was used primarily for strummed chordal accompaniment, 19-fret necks with a scale length of 21¾ to 23 inches became standard. The usual tuning is the <a href="all-fifths%20tuning">all-fifths tuning</a> C3 G3 D4 A4, in which there are exactly seven <a href="semitone">semitone</a>s (a <a href="perfect%20fifth">perfect fifth</a>) between the <a href="open%20note">open note</a>s of consecutive <a href="open%20string%20%28music%29">string</a>s. Other players (particularly in <a href="Irish%20traditional%20music">Irish traditional music</a>) tune the banjo G2 D3 A3 E4 like an <a href="octave%20mandolin">octave mandolin</a>, which lets the banjoist duplicate fiddle and mandolin fingering. The popularisation of this tuning was usually attributed to the late <a href="Barney%20McKenna">Barney McKenna</a>, banjoist with <a href="The%20Dubliners">The Dubliners</a>. Fingerstyle on tenor banjo retuned to open G tuning dgd'g' or lower open D tuning Adad' (three finger picking, frailing) have been explored by Mirek Patek.

The tenor banjo was a common rhythm-instrument in early 20th-century dance-bands. Its volume and timbre suited early jazz (and jazz-influenced popular music styles) and could both compete with other instruments (such as <a href="brass%20instruments">brass instruments</a> and <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a>s) and be heard clearly on acoustic recordings. <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>'s "<a href="Rhapsody%20in%20Blue">Rhapsody in Blue</a>", in <a href="Ferde%20Grofe">Ferde Grofe</a>'s original jazz orchestra arrangement, includes tenor banjo, with widely spaced chords not easily playable on plectrum banjo in its conventional tuning(s). With development of the archtop and electric guitar, the tenor banjo largely disappeared from jazz and popular music, though keeping its place in traditional "Dixieland" jazz.

Some 1920s Irish banjo players picked out the melodies of jigs, reels and hornpipes on tenor banjos, decorating the tunes with snappy triplet ornaments. The most important Irish banjo player of this era was Mike Flanagan of the New York-based Flanagan Brothers, one of the most popular Irish-American groups of the day. Other pre-WW2 Irish banjo players included Neil Nolan, who recorded with Dan Sullivan's Shamrock Band in Boston, and Jimmy McDade, who recorded with the Four Provinces Orchestra in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in Ireland the rise of "ceili" bands provided a new market for a loud instrument like the tenor banjo. Use of the tenor banjo in Irish music has increased greatly since the folk revival of the 1960s.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries there was a vogue in plucked-string instrument ensembles—guitar orchestras, mandolin orchestras, banjo orchestras—in which the instrumentation was made to parallel that of the string section in symphony orchestras. Thus "violin, viola, 'cello, bass" became "mandolin, mandola, mandocello, mandobass", or in the case of banjos, "banjolin, banjola, banjo cello, bass banjo". Because the range of pluck stringed instrument generally isn't as great as that of comparably-size bowed string instruments, other instruments were often added to these plucked orchestras to extend the range of the ensemble upwards and downwards.

Rarer than either the tenor or plectrum banjo is the <a href="cello%20banjo">cello banjo</a> (also "banjo cello"). It's normally tuned C2-G2-D3-A3, one octave below the tenor banjo like the cello and mandocello. It played a role in banjo orchestras in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A five-string cello banjo, set up like a bluegrass banjo (with the short 5th string), but tuned one octave lower, has been produced by the Goldtone company.

 Bass banjos have been produced in both upright bass formats and with standard, horizontally carried banjo bodies. Contrabass banjos with either three or four strings have also been made; some of these had headstocks similar to those of bass violins. Tuning varies on these large instruments, with four-string models sometimes being tuned in 4ths like a bass violin—E1-A1-D2-G2, and sometimes in 5ths, like a four-string cello banjo, one octave lower—C1-G1-D2-A2. Other variants are also used.

The six-string banjo began as a British innovation by William Temlet, one of England's earliest banjo makers. He opened a shop in London in 1846, and sold banjos with closed backs and up to seven strings. He marketed these as "zither" Banjos from his 1869 patent. American Alfred Davis Cammeyer (1862–1949), a young violinist-turned banjo concert player, devised the five or six-string zither banjo around 1880. It had a wood resonator and metal "wire" strings (the 1st and 2nd melody strings and 5th "thumb" string. The 3rd melody string was gut and the 4th was silk covered) as well as frets and guitar-style tuning machines.

A zither banjo usually has a closed back and sides with the drum body (usually metal) and skin tensioning system suspended inside the wooden rim/back, the neck and string tailpiece was mounted on the wooden outer rim, the short string usually led through a tube in the neck so that the tuning peg could be mounted on the peg head. They were often made by builders who used guitar tuners that came in banks of three and so if 5 stringed had a redundant tuner. The banjos could also be somewhat easily converted over to a six-string banjo. British <a href="opera">opera</a> diva <a href="Adelina%20Patti">Adelina Patti</a> advised Cammeyer that the zither-banjo might be popular with English audiences (it was invented there), and Cammeyer went to London in 1888. With his virtuoso playing, he helped show that banjos could make sophisticated music than normally played by <a href="blackface">blackface</a> minstrels. He was soon performing for London society, where he met Sir <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a>, who recommended that Cammeyer progress from arranging the music of others for banjo to composing his own music. (Supposedly unknown to Cammeyer, William Temlett had patented a seven-string closed back banjo in 1869, and was already marketing it as a "zither-banjo.")

In the late 1890s Banjo maker F.C Wilkes developed a six-string version of the banjo, with the 6th string "tunnelled" through the neck. It is arguable that Arthur O. Windsor influenced development and perfection of the zither banjo and created the open-back banjo along with other modifications to the banjo type instruments, such as the modern non-solid attached resonator. (Gibson claims credit for this modification on the American Continent.) Windsor claimed he created the hollow neck banjo with a truss rod, and buried the 5th string in the neck after the 5th fret so to put the tuning peg on the peg-head rather than in the neck. Gibson claims credit for perfecting the tone ring.

Modern six-string bluegrass banjos have been made. These add a bass string between the lowest string and the drone string on a five-string banjo, and are usually tuned G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4. <a href="Sonny%20Osborne">Sonny Osborne</a> played one of these instruments for several years. It was modified by luthier Rual Yarbrough from a Vega five-string model. A picture of Sonny with this banjo appears in Pete Wernick's "Bluegrass Banjo" method book.

Six-string banjos having a guitar neck and a banjo body have become quite popular since the mid-1990s. See under "Banjo Hybrids and variants", below.

A number of hybrid instruments exist, crossing the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use the body of a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include the <a href="Banjo%20Mandolin">banjo mandolin</a> (first patented in 1882) and the <a href="banjo%20ukulele">banjo ukulele</a> or <a href="banjolele">banjolele</a>, most famously played by the English comedian <a href="George%20Formby">George Formby</a>. These were especially popular in the early decades of the twentieth century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric amplification.

The six-string <a href="banjo%20guitar">banjo guitar</a> basically consists of a six-string guitar neck attached to a bluegrass or plectrum banjo body. This was the instrument of the early jazz great <a href="Johnny%20St.%20Cyr">Johnny St. Cyr</a>, jazzmen <a href="Django%20Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a>, <a href="Danny%20Barker">Danny Barker</a>, <a href="Papa%20Charlie%20Jackson">Papa Charlie Jackson</a> and <a href="Clancy%20Hayes">Clancy Hayes</a>, as well as the blues and gospel singer The <a href="Reverend%20Gary%20Davis">Reverend Gary Davis</a>. Nowadays, it appears under various names such as guitanjo, guitjoe, ganjo, banjitar, or bantar. Today, musicians as diverse as <a href="Keith%20Urban">Keith Urban</a>, <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a>, <a href="Taj%20Mahal%20%28musician%29">Taj Mahal</a>, <a href="Joe%20Satriani">Joe Satriani</a>, <a href="David%20Hidalgo">David Hidalgo</a>, <a href="Larry%20Lalonde">Larry Lalonde</a> and <a href="Doc%20Watson">Doc Watson</a> play the six-string guitar banjo.
Rhythm guitarist <a href="Dave%20Day">Dave Day</a> of 1960s proto-punks <a href="The%20Monks">The Monks</a> replaced his guitar with a six-string, gut-strung guitar banjo on which he played guitar chords. This instrument sounds much more metallic, scratchy and wiry than a standard electric guitar, due to its amplification via a small microphone stuck inside the banjo's body.

Instruments that have a five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, a guitar, <a href="bouzouki">bouzouki</a>, or <a href="dobro">dobro</a> body) have also been made, such as the banjola. A 20th-Century <a href="Music%20of%20Turkey">Turkish</a> instrument similar to the banjo is called the <a href="c%C3%BCmb%C3%BC%C5%9F">cümbüş</a>—which has been made into eight different hybrid instruments, including guitar, mandolin, ukulele, and <a href="oud">oud</a>. At the end of the twentieth century, a development of the five-string banjo was the BanSitar. This features a bone bridge, giving the instrument a <a href="sitar">sitar</a>-like resonance. A recent innovation is the patented Banjo-Tam, invented by Frank Abrams of Asheville North Carolina combining a traditional five string banjo neck with a tambourine as a rim or "pot".

Baseball is a <a href="bat-and-ball%20games">bat-and-ball game</a> played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns <a href="batting%20%28baseball%29">batting</a> and fielding. The batting team attempts to score <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a> by hitting a <a href="baseball%20%28ball%29">ball</a> (that is thrown by the opposing team's <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a>) with a <a href="baseball%20bat">bat</a> swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around a series of four <a href="base%20%28baseball%29">bases</a>: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player <a href="base%20running">advances around the bases</a> and returns to home plate.

Players on the <a href="batting%20team%20%28baseball%29">batting team</a> take turns hitting against the pitcher of the <a href="fielding%20team%20%28baseball%29">fielding team</a>, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">out</a> in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base <a href="safe%20%28baseball%29">safely</a> can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a> or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an <a href="inning">inning</a>. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, <a href="extra%20innings">extra innings</a> are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.

Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, <a href="History%20of%20baseball%20in%20the%20United%20States">where the modern version developed</a>. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the <a href="national%20sport">national sport</a> of the United States. Baseball is currently popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in <a href="Baseball%20in%20Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="Baseball%20in%20South%20Korea">South Korea</a>.

In the United States and Canada, professional <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) teams are divided into the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) and <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason">playoffs</a> that culminate in the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the <a href="Central%20League">Central</a> and <a href="Pacific%20League">Pacific League</a>s and in Cuba between the <a href="Cuban%20National%20Series">West League and East League</a>.

The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A <a href="Medieval%20French%20literature">French</a> manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly "<a href="la%20soule">la soule</a>", with similarities to baseball. Other old French games such as "thèque", "la balle au bâton", and "la balle empoisonnée" also appear to be related. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game <a href="rounders">rounders</a>, popular in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Great Britain and Ireland</a>. "<a href="Baseball%20Before%20We%20Knew%20It">Baseball Before We Knew It</a>: A Search for the Roots of the Game" (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of <a href="stoolball">stoolball</a> and "tut-ball". It has long been believed that <a href="cricket">cricket</a> also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>.

The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, "<a href="A%20Little%20Pretty%20Pocket-Book">A Little Pretty Pocket-Book</a>", by <a href="John%20Newbery">John Newbery</a>. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases. David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, and featured the <a href="Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> as a player. William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a> 1755 in <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>, Surrey. This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the United States by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 <a href="Pittsfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</a> town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town's new meeting house. By 1796, a version of the game was well-known enough to earn a mention in a German scholar's book on popular pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, ""englische Base-ball"" involved a contest between two teams, in which "the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate." Only one out was required to retire a side.
By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. These games were often referred to locally as "<a href="town%20ball">town ball</a>", though other names such as "round-ball" and "base-ball" were also used. Among the earliest examples to receive a detailed description—albeit five decades after the fact, in a letter from an attendee to "<a href="Sporting%20Life%20%28American%20newspaper%29">Sporting Life</a>" magazine—took place in <a href="South-West%20Oxford%23Communities">Beachville, Ontario</a>, in 1838. There were many similarities to modern baseball, and some crucial differences: five bases (or "byes"); first bye just from the home bye; batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce. The <a href="Doubleday%20myth">once widely accepted story</a> that <a href="Abner%20Doubleday">Abner Doubleday</a> invented baseball in <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>, in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians.

In 1845, <a href="Alexander%20Cartwright">Alexander Cartwright</a>, a member of New York City's <a href="Knickerbocker%20Club">Knickerbocker Club</a>, led the codification of the so-called <a href="Knickerbocker%20Rules">Knickerbocker Rules</a>. The practice, common to bat-and-ball games of the day, of "soaking" or "plugging"—effecting a <a href="putout">putout</a> by hitting a runner with a thrown ball—was barred. The rules thus facilitated the use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers' game close to the modern one, though a ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand pitching was allowed. While there are reports that the <a href="New%20York%20Knickerbockers">New York Knickerbockers</a> played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846 in <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>: the "New York Nine" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.

In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the <a href="New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">New York metropolitan area</a>. By 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the "national pastime" or "national game." A year later, sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing body, the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Base Ball Players</a>. In 1858 in <a href="Corona%2C%20Queens">Corona, Queens</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the all-stars of <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, including players from the <a href="Brooklyn%20Atlantics">Brooklyn Atlantics</a>, <a href="Excelsior%20of%20Brooklyn">Excelsior of Brooklyn</a>, Putnams and <a href="Eckford%20of%20Brooklyn">Eckford of Brooklyn</a>, and the All Stars of New York (<a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>), including players from the <a href="New%20York%20Knickerbockers">New York Knickerbockers</a>, Gothams (predecessors of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>), Eagles and Empire, are commonly believed to be the first all-star baseball games. In 1863, the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a <a href="fair%20ball">fair ball</a> on the first bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a>. The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club, the <a href="Cincinnati%20Red%20Stockings">Cincinnati Red Stockings</a>, was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams. The first professional league, the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</a>, lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute <a href="National%20Association%20as%20a%20major%20league">its status as a major league</a>.

The more formally structured <a href="National%20League">National League</a> was founded in 1876. As the oldest surviving major league, the National League is sometimes referred to as the "senior circuit." Several other major leagues formed and failed. In 1884, African American <a href="Moses%20Fleetwood%20Walker">Moses Walker</a> (and, briefly, his brother Welday) played in one of these, the <a href="American%20Association%20%2819th%20century%29">American Association</a>. An injury ended Walker's major league career, and by the early 1890s, a <a href="gentlemen%27s%20agreement">gentlemen's agreement</a> in the form of the <a href="baseball%20color%20line">baseball color line</a> effectively barred black players from the white-owned professional leagues, major and minor. Professional <a href="Negro%20league%20baseball">Negro leagues</a> formed, but quickly folded. Several independent African American teams succeeded as <a href="barnstorm%20%28sports%29">barnstormers</a>. Also in 1884, overhand pitching was legalized. In 1887, <a href="softball">softball</a>, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. Virtually all of the modern <a href="baseball%20rules">baseball rules</a> were in place by 1893; the last major change—counting <a href="foul%20ball">foul ball</a>s as <a href="strike%20zone">strikes</a>—was instituted in 1901. The National League's first successful counterpart, the <a href="American%20League">American League</a>, which evolved from the minor <a href="Western%20League%20%28original%29">Western League</a>, was established that year. The two leagues, each with eight teams, were rivals that fought for the best players, often disregarding each other's contracts and engaging in bitter legal disputes.
A modicum of peace was eventually established, leading to the National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor professional leagues</a>. The <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Americans</a> of the American League defeated the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> of the National League. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a>, under <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> <a href="John%20McGraw%20%28baseball%29">John McGraw</a>, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.

As professional baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted <a href="strike%20action">strikes</a>, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the <a href="reserve%20clause">reserve clause</a>, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner <a href="Charles%20Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a> and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> conspired to <a href="match%20fixing">throw</a> the <a href="1919%20World%20Series">1919 World Series</a>. The <a href="Black%20Sox%20Scandal">Black Sox Scandal</a> led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">major league baseball commissioner</a>, <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a>, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the <a href="Negro%20National%20League%20%281920%E2%80%931931%29">Negro National League</a>; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the <a href="Eastern%20Colored%20League">Eastern Colored League</a>.

Professional baseball was played in northeastern cities with a large immigrant-ethnic population; they gave strong support to the new sport. The <a href="Irish%20American">Irish Catholics</a> dominated in the late 19th century, comprising a third or more of the players and many of the top stars and managers. Historian Jerrold Casway argues that:

Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers, including stars <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a> and <a href="Christy%20Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a>, were more dominant. The "<a href="Inside%20Baseball%20%28strategy%29">inside game</a>", which demanded that players "scratch for runs", was played much more aggressively than it is today: the brilliant and often violent <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> epitomized this style. The so-called <a href="dead-ball%20era">dead-ball era</a> ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the <a href="spitball">spitball</a> and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, followed the death of <a href="Ray%20Chapman">Ray Chapman</a> after a pitch struck him in the head in August 1920. Coupled with superior materials available after World War I, this resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of reducing the distance to the outfield fences, making <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s more common. The rise of the legendary player <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. The club with which Ruth set most of his slugging records, the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, built a reputation as the majors' premier team. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> <a href="Branch%20Rickey">Branch Rickey</a> invested in several <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league clubs</a> and developed the first modern "<a href="farm%20team">farm system</a>". A new <a href="Negro%20National%20League%20%281933%E2%80%931948%29">Negro National League</a> was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the <a href="Negro%20American%20League">Negro American League</a>. The <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201936">first elections</a> to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> took place in 1936. In 1939 <a href="Little%20League%20Baseball">Little League Baseball</a> was founded in Pennsylvania. By the late 1940s, it was the organizing body for <a href="Amateur%20baseball%20in%20the%20United%20States">children's baseball leagues</a> across the United States.

With America's entry into World War II, many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well. <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> owner <a href="Philip%20K.%20Wrigley">Philip K. Wrigley</a> led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye – the <a href="All-American%20Girls%20Professional%20Baseball%20League">All-American Girls Professional Baseball League</a> existed from 1943 to 1954. The inaugural <a href="College%20World%20Series">College World Series</a> was held in 1947, and the <a href="Babe%20Ruth%20League">Babe Ruth League</a> youth program was founded. This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> was signed by the National League's <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>—where Branch Rickey had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league <a href="Montreal%20Royals">team in Montreal</a>. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers; <a href="Larry%20Doby">Larry Doby</a> debuted with the American League's <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> later the same year. Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born <a href="Chico%20Carrasquel">Chico Carrasquel</a> and black Cuban-born <a href="Minnie%20Mi%C3%B1oso">Minnie Miñoso</a>, became the first Hispanic <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Stars</a>.

Facing competition as varied as television and <a href="American%20football">football</a>, baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved. <a href="Racial%20integration">Integration</a> proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster. That year, the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Major League Baseball Players Association</a> was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years. No major league team had been located west of <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco</a>, respectively. The majors' final all-white bastion, the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, added a black player in 1959. With the integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year. In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Angels">Los Angeles Angels</a> <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>, and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped <a href="Roger%20Maris">Roger Maris</a> break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball. Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.

The players' union became bolder under the leadership of former <a href="United%20Steelworkers">United Steelworkers</a> chief economist and negotiator <a href="Marvin%20Miller">Marvin Miller</a>, who was elected executive director in 1966. On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, the <a href="strike%20zone">strike zone</a> was reduced and the height of the <a href="pitcher%27s%20mound">pitcher's mound</a> was lowered from 15 to 10 inches (38.1 - 25.4 cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also that same year, <a href="Curt%20Flood">Curt Flood</a> of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' <a href="1972%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">first general players' strike</a> took place in 1972, delaying the season's start for two weeks. In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> rule the following year. In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was <a href="Seitz%20decision">effectively struck down</a>, leading to the <a href="free%20agent">free agency system</a>. In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1981</a> and <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1994</a>, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.

The addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, and again in the abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning <a href="wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild card</a> teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season <a href="interleague%20play">interleague play</a> was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. The next year, <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a> and <a href="Sammy%20Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a> <a href="1998%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20home%20run%20record%20chase">both surpassed</a> Maris's decades-old single season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and <a href="umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpire</a> supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB).

In 2001, <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a> established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by <a href="Banned%20substances%20in%20baseball">the abuse of illegal steroids</a> (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs. Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as well as many other players, including storied pitcher <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a>—have been implicated in the <a href="steroid%20era">steroid abuse scandal</a>, their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction. In contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade. With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, which became known as the "Year of the Pitcher". Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century.

Before the start of the 2012 season, MLB altered its rules to double the number of wild card teams admitted into the playoffs to two per league. The playoff expansion resulted in the addition of annual <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20wild-card%20game">one-game playoffs</a> between the wild card teams in each league.

Baseball, widely known as America's pastime, is well established in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the <a href="International%20Association%20for%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players">International Association</a>, featured teams from both countries. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a> joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Nationals</a>.
In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at <a href="Parque%20Los%20Berros">Parque Los Berros</a> in <a href="Xalapa">Xalapa</a>, <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>. A few days after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cerro%20Gordo">Battle of Cerro Gordo</a>, they used the "wooden leg captured (by the Fourth Illinois regiment) from General <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Santa Anna</a>". The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition and whose national team has been one of the world's strongest since international play began in the late 1930s (all organized baseball in the country has officially been amateur since the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>). The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938). The <a href="Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball">Japanese major leagues</a>—the <a href="Central%20League">Central League</a> and <a href="Pacific%20League">Pacific League</a>—have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States. Japan has a professional minor league system as well, though it is much smaller than the American version—each team has only one farm club in contrast to MLB teams' four or five.

After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual <a href="Caribbean%20Series">Caribbean Series</a> has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the <a href="Dominican%20Professional%20Baseball%20League">Dominican Professional Baseball League</a>, <a href="Mexican%20Pacific%20League">Mexican Pacific League</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20Professional%20Baseball%20League">Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League</a>, and <a href="Venezuelan%20Professional%20Baseball%20League">Venezuelan Professional Baseball League</a>. In Asia, <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> (1982), <a href="Taiwan%2C%20Province%20of%20China">Taiwan, Province of China</a> (1990) and <a href="China">China</a> (2003) all have professional leagues.

Many European countries have professional leagues as well, the most successful, other than the <a href="Honkbal%20Hoofdklasse">Dutch league</a>, being the <a href="Serie%20A1%20%28baseball%29">Italian league</a> founded in 1948. Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the <a href="2004%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>. The <a href="Israel%20Baseball%20League">Israel Baseball League</a>, launched in 2007, folded after one season. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads. Other competitions between national teams, such as the <a href="Baseball%20World%20Cup">Baseball World Cup</a> and the <a href="Baseball%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympic baseball tournament</a>, were administered by the <a href="International%20Baseball%20Federation">International Baseball Federation</a> (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the <a href="International%20Softball%20Federation">International Softball Federation</a> to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the <a href="World%20Baseball%20Softball%20Confederation">World Baseball Softball Confederation</a> (WBSC). By 2009, the IBAF had 117 member countries. <a href="Women%27s%20baseball">Women's baseball</a> is played on an organized amateur basis in many of the countries where it is a leading men's sport. Since 2004, the IBAF and now WBSC have sanctioned the <a href="Women%27s%20Baseball%20World%20Cup">Women's Baseball World Cup</a>, featuring national teams.

After being admitted to the Olympics as a <a href="Olympic%20sport">medal sport</a> beginning with the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Games</a>, baseball was dropped from the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games">2012 Summer Olympic Games</a> at the 2005 <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> <a href="117th%20IOC%20Session">meeting</a>. It remained part of the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games">2008 Games</a>. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> now does during the <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">Winter Olympic Games</a>. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Summer Olympics</a>, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the <a href="World%20Baseball%20Classic">World Baseball Classic</a>, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The <a href="2006%20World%20Baseball%20Classic">inaugural Classic</a>, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its <a href="2011%20Baseball%20World%20Cup">2011 edition</a> in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.

A game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (<a href="Batting%20%28baseball%29">batting</a> and <a href="baserunning">baserunning</a>) and defense (<a href="pitch%20%28baseball%29">pitching</a> and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an <a href="inning">inning</a>. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in <a href="doubleheader%20%28baseball%29">doubleheaders</a> in college and minor leagues). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (<a href="run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a>) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped <a href="baseball%20field">baseball diamond</a>. A player bats at <a href="home%20plate">home plate</a> and must proceed <a href="counterclockwise">counterclockwise</a> to first base, second base, third base, and back home in order to score a run. The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">outs</a>, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's <a href="batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">batting order</a> comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, <a href="extra%20innings">extra innings</a> are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.

The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the <a href="infield">infield</a>; the area farther beyond the infield is the <a href="outfield">outfield</a>. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). Fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.

There are three basic tools of baseball: the <a href="baseball%20%28ball%29">ball</a>, the <a href="baseball%20bat">bat</a>, and the <a href="baseball%20glove">glove or mitt</a>:
Protective <a href="batting%20helmet">helmets</a> are also standard equipment for all batters.

At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a>, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the <a href="catcher">catcher</a>, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the <a href="baseball%20positions">standard arrangement</a>, there is a <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> positioned several steps to the left of first base, a <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a> to the right of second base, a <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> to the left of second base, and a <a href="third%20baseman">third baseman</a> to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are <a href="left%20fielder">left fielder</a>, <a href="center%20fielder">center fielder</a>, and <a href="right%20fielder">right fielder</a>. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral <a href="umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpire</a> sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.
Play starts with a batter standing at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a "runner" (or, until the play is over, a "batter-runner"). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being <a href="putout">put out</a> (see below) is said to be "<a href="safe%20%28baseball%29">safe</a>" and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a>. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">single</a>. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a>; third base, a <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triple</a>. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a <a href="home%20run">home run</a>: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">error</a>.

Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base "must" attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes <a href="dead%20ball%20%28baseball%29">dead</a> and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has <a href="flyout">flied out</a> and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they <a href="tag%20up">tag up</a> or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>.

A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded <a href="strikeout">strikes out</a>. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a <a href="base%20on%20balls">base on balls</a> or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the <a href="strike%20zone">strike zone</a>, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.

A strike is called when one of the following happens:
A ball is called when the pitcher throws a pitch that is outside the strike zone, provided the batter has not swung at it.
While the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. Among the various ways a member of the batting team may be put out, five are most common:
It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a <a href="double%20play">double play</a>. Even three outs in one play, a <a href="triple%20play">triple play</a>, is possible, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's <a href="dugout%20%28baseball%29">dugout</a> or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.

An individual player's turn batting or <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a> is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting <a href="caught%20stealing">caught stealing</a> (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.

If the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.

Roster, or squad, sizes differ between different leagues and different levels of organized play. Major League Baseball teams maintain 25-player active rosters. A typical 25-man roster in a league without the DH rule, such as MLB's National League, features:

In the American League and others with the DH rule, there will usually be nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher and two or three other reserves; the need for late inning pinch-hitters is reduced by the DH.

The <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a>, or head coach of a team, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more <a href="coach%20%28baseball%29">coaches</a>; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.

Any baseball game involves one or more <a href="umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpires</a>, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.

Many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.

The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the <a href="fastball">fastball</a>, the <a href="changeup">changeup</a> (or off-speed pitch), and two <a href="breaking%20ball">breaking ball</a>s—the <a href="curveball">curveball</a> and the <a href="slider">slider</a>. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28S%29%23shake%20off">shake off the sign</a> and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28L%29%23lead">taking a lead</a>, the pitcher may attempt a <a href="pickoff">pickoff</a>, a quick throw to a fielder <a href="covering%20a%20base">covering the base</a> to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a <a href="balk">balk</a> against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a> is anticipated, the catcher may call for a <a href="pitchout">pitchout</a>, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28S%29%23shift">shift</a>, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28P%29%23playing%20in">play in</a>, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28G%29%23ground%20ball">ground ball</a>, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.

Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The <a href="hit%20and%20run%20%28baseball%29">hit and run</a> is sometimes employed with a skillful <a href="contact%20hitter">contact hitter</a>: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The <a href="sacrifice%20bunt">sacrifice bunt</a> calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into <a href="scoring%20position">scoring position</a> even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to <a href="bunt%20%28baseball%29">bunt</a> for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a <a href="squeeze%20play%20%28baseball%29">squeeze play</a>. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter in this case gets credit for a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a>. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28A%29%23ahead%20in%20the%20count">ahead in the count</a> (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28T%29%23take%20sign">take</a>, or not swing at, the next pitch.

Baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none of them is the variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The <a href="comparison%20between%20cricket%20and%20baseball">comparison between cricket and baseball</a> demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.

In clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead <a href="stalling%20%28gaming%29">killing the clock</a> rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> and <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.

While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, <a href="Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball">Nippon Professional Baseball</a> took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.

Although baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: "the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits". Contrasting the game with both football and basketball, scholar <a href="Michael%20Mandelbaum">Michael Mandelbaum</a> argues that "baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports". Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. As described by Mandelbaum,

It is impossible to isolate and objectively assess the contribution each [football] team member makes to the outcome of the play... [E]very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates all the time. In baseball, by contrast, every player is more or less on his own... Baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and total responsibility. A baseball player lives in a glass house, and in a stark moral universe... Everything that every player does is accounted for and everything accounted for is either good or bad, right or wrong.

Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">batting partnership</a> and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the <a href="wicket">wicket</a> for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.

Unlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of Major League and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of from home plate to the fences in left and right field and to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at <a href="Minute%20Maid%20Park">Minute Maid Park</a>, which became the home of the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> in 2000, the <a href="Crawford%20Boxes">Crawford Boxes</a> in left field are only from home plate. There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>, in use since 1912: the <a href="Green%20Monster">Green Monster</a> is from home plate down the line and tall.

Similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or <a href="inside-the-park%20home%20run">inside-the-park home run</a>. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as <a href="AstroTurf">AstroTurf</a>. Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.

These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is <a href="Coors%20Field">Coors Field</a>, home of the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Colorado Rockies</a>. Its high altitude— above sea level—is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues. <a href="Wrigley%20Field">Wrigley Field</a>, home of the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball into right field might result in an easy catch on the <a href="warning%20track">warning track</a> at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed <a href="pull%20hitter">pull hitter</a>s, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.

Organized baseball lends itself to <a href="statistics">statistics</a> to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born <a href="Henry%20Chadwick%20%28writer%29">Henry Chadwick</a> of <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, was responsible for the "development of the <a href="box%20score%20%28baseball%29">box score</a>, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball." The statistical record is so central to the game's "historical essence" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball. In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian <a href="Alan%20Schwarz">Alan Schwarz</a> describes as a "tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines."

The Official Baseball Rules administered by Major League Baseball require the <a href="official%20scorer">official scorer</a> to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The <a href="baseball%20scorekeeping">score report</a> is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records. General managers, managers, and <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">baseball scouts</a> use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.
Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include:
The basic baserunning statistics include:

The basic pitching statistics include:
The basic fielding statistics include:

Among the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as "situational statistics". For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher <a href="intentional%20base%20on%20balls">intentionally walk</a> the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.

<a href="Sabermetrics">Sabermetrics</a> refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a>, and derives from the <a href="Society%20for%20American%20Baseball%20Research">Society for American Baseball Research</a> (SABR).

The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:

Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:

Writing in 1919, philosopher <a href="Morris%20Raphael%20Cohen">Morris Raphael Cohen</a> described baseball as America's national religion. In the words of sports columnist <a href="Jayson%20Stark">Jayson Stark</a>, baseball has long been "a unique paragon of American culture"—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal. Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes "how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan." Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of <a href="San%20Pedro%20de%20Macor%C3%ADs">San Pedro de Macorís</a>, has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent. Hall-of-Famer <a href="Roberto%20Clemente">Roberto Clemente</a> remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico's history. While baseball has long been the island's primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues' annual first-year player draft. In the Western Hemisphere, baseball is also one of the leading sports in Canada, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, Mexico, the <a href="Netherlands%20Antilles">Netherlands Antilles</a>, <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, and <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. In Asia, it is among the most popular sports in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> and <a href="Taiwan%20Area">Taiwan Area</a>.

The major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.

In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, Major League Baseball set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching the NFL's revenue for the first time in decades. A new MLB revenue record of $6.6 billion was set in 2009. On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 16%, compared to pro football at 31%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. Attendance at games held under the <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a> umbrella also set a record in 2007, with 42.8 million; this figure does not include attendance at games of the several independent minor leagues.
In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in <a href="Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball">Nippon Professional Baseball</a> (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country. In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues. Revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system. Similarly, according to one official pronouncement, the sport's governing authority "has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes".

As of 2007, Little League Baseball oversees more than 7,000 children's baseball leagues with more than 2.2 million participants–2.1 million in the United States and 123,000 in other countries. Babe Ruth League teams have over 1 million participants. According to the president of the International Baseball Federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world, including Little League and the introductory game of <a href="Tee%20Ball">Tee Ball</a>.

A varsity baseball team is an established part of <a href="physical%20education">physical education</a> departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' baseball teams. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, <a href="High%20school%20baseball%20in%20Japan">high school baseball</a> in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the <a href="National%20High%20School%20Baseball%20Invitational%20Tournament">National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament</a> in the spring, and the even more important <a href="National%20High%20School%20Baseball%20Championship">National High School Baseball Championship</a> in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the <a href="Koshien%20Stadium">55,000-capacity stadium</a> where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.

Baseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of <a href="English%20language%20idioms%20derived%20from%20baseball">English-language idioms have been derived from baseball</a>; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used <a href="Baseball%20metaphors%20for%20sex">sexual euphemisms</a>. The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the <a href="1922%20World%20Series">1922 World Series</a>: famed sportswriter <a href="Grantland%20Rice">Grantland Rice</a> announced <a href="play-by-play">play-by-play</a> from New York City's <a href="Polo%20Grounds">Polo Grounds</a> on <a href="WABC%20%28AM%29%23As%20WJZ">WJZ</a>–<a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>, which was connected by wire to <a href="WGY%20%28AM%29">WGY</a>–<a href="Schenectady%2C%20New%20York">Schenectady, New York</a>, and <a href="WBZ%20%28AM%29">WBZ</a>–<a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a>. The <a href="baseball%20cap">baseball cap</a> has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.

Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, <a href="Ernest%20Thayer">Ernest Thayer</a>'s poem "<a href="Casey%20at%20the%20Bat">Casey at the Bat</a>", appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a "clutch situation", the poem became the source of <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many <a href="baseball%20movie">baseball movie</a>s, including the <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>–winning "<a href="The%20Pride%20of%20the%20Yankees">The Pride of the Yankees</a>" (1942) and the Oscar nominees "<a href="The%20Natural%20%28film%29">The Natural</a>" (1984) and "<a href="Field%20of%20Dreams">Field of Dreams</a>" (1989). The <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>'s selection of the ten best sports movies includes "The Pride of the Yankees" at number 3 and "<a href="Bull%20Durham">Bull Durham</a>" (1988) at number 5. Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the <a href="Richard%20Adler">Adler</a>–<a href="Jerry%20Ross%20%28composer%29">Ross</a> musical "<a href="Damn%20Yankees">Damn Yankees</a>"—and record—<a href="George%20J.%20Gaskin">George J. Gaskin</a>'s "Slide, Kelly, Slide", <a href="Simon%20and%20Garfunkel">Simon and Garfunkel</a>'s "<a href="Mrs.%20Robinson">Mrs. Robinson</a>", and <a href="John%20Fogerty">John Fogerty</a>'s "<a href="Centerfield%20%28song%29">Centerfield</a>". The baseball-inspired comedic sketch "<a href="Who%27s%20on%20First">Who's on First</a>", popularized by <a href="Abbott%20and%20Costello">Abbott and Costello</a> in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century. Baseball is also featured in various video games including "", "<a href="Wii%20Sports">Wii Sports</a>", "" and "<a href="Mario%20Baseball">Mario Baseball</a>".

Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of <a href="Ring%20Lardner">Ring Lardner</a> and novels such as <a href="Bernard%20Malamud">Bernard Malamud</a>'s "<a href="The%20Natural">The Natural</a>" (the source for the movie), <a href="Robert%20Coover">Robert Coover</a>'s "<a href="The%20Universal%20Baseball%20Association%2C%20Inc.%2C%20J.%20Henry%20Waugh%2C%20Prop.">The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.</a>", and <a href="W.%20P.%20Kinsella">W. P. Kinsella</a>'s "<a href="Shoeless%20Joe%20%28novel%29">Shoeless Joe</a>" (the source for "Field of Dreams"). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of <a href="Damon%20Runyon">Damon Runyon</a>; the columns of Grantland Rice, <a href="Red%20Smith%20%28sportswriter%29">Red Smith</a>, <a href="Dick%20Young%20%28sportswriter%29">Dick Young</a>, and <a href="Peter%20Gammons">Peter Gammons</a>; and the essays of <a href="Roger%20Angell">Roger Angell</a>. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are <a href="Lawrence%20S.%20Ritter">Lawrence S. Ritter</a>'s "<a href="The%20Glory%20of%20Their%20Times">The Glory of Their Times</a>", <a href="Roger%20Kahn">Roger Kahn</a>'s "<a href="The%20Boys%20of%20Summer%20%28book%29">The Boys of Summer</a>", and <a href="Michael%20Lewis%20%28author%29">Michael Lewis</a>'s "<a href="Moneyball">Moneyball</a>". The 1970 publication of major league pitcher <a href="Jim%20Bouton">Jim Bouton</a>'s tell-all chronicle "<a href="Ball%20Four">Ball Four</a>" is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.

Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. <a href="Baseball%20card">Baseball card</a>s were introduced in the late 19th century as <a href="trade%20card">trade card</a>s. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader <a href="trading%20card">trading card</a> industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.

Modern <a href="fantasy%20sports">fantasy sports</a> began in 1980 with the invention of <a href="Fantasy%20baseball%23Rotisserie%20League%20Baseball">Rotisserie League Baseball</a> by New York writer <a href="Daniel%20Okrent">Daniel Okrent</a> and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active Major League Baseball players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as <a href="fantasy%20baseball">fantasy baseball</a>, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports–related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby. The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.

History of baseball in the United States

The history of baseball in the United States can be traced to the 19th century, when amateurs played a <a href="baseball">baseball</a>-like game by their own informal rules using homemade equipment. The popularity of the sport inspired the semi-pro national baseball clubs in the 1860s.

The earliest known mention of baseball in the U.S was a 1791 <a href="Pittsfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</a> ordinance banning the playing of the game within of the town meeting house. In 1903, the British sportswriter Henry Chadwick published an article speculating that baseball derived from a British game called <a href="rounders">rounders</a>, which Chadwick had played as a boy in England. But baseball executive Albert Spalding disagreed. Baseball, said Spalding, was fundamentally an American sport and began on American soil. To settle the matter, the two men appointed a commission, headed by Abraham Mills, the fourth president of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. The commission, which also included six other sports executives, labored for three years, after which it declared that <a href="Abner%20Doubleday">Abner Doubleday</a> invented the national pastime. This would have been a surprise to Doubleday. The late Civil War hero "never knew that he had invented baseball". [But] 15 years [after his death], he was anointed as the father of the game", writes baseball historian John Thorn. The <a href="Doubleday%20myth">myth about Doubleday inventing the game of baseball</a> actually came from a <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> mining engineer. Another early reference reports that "base ball" was regularly played on Saturdays in 1823 on the outskirts of New York City in an area that today is <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>.

The first team to play baseball under modern rules was long believed to be the <a href="New%20York%20Knickerbockers">New York Knickerbockers</a>. The club was founded on September 23, 1845, as a social club for the upper middle classes of New York City, and was strictly <a href="amateur">amateur</a> until it disbanded. The club's by-laws committee, which included <a href="William%20R.%20Wheaton">William R. Wheaton</a> and <a href="William%20H.%20Tucker%20%28baseball%29">William H. Tucker</a>, formulated the "Knickerbocker Rules", which in large part dealt with organizational matters but which also laid out rules for playing the game. One of the significant rules prohibited "soaking" or "plugging" the runner; under older rules, a fielder could put a runner out by hitting the runner with the thrown ball, similarly to the common schoolyard game of <a href="kickball">kickball</a>. The Knickerbocker Rules required fielders to tag or force the runner, as is done today, and avoided a lot of the arguments and fistfights that resulted from the earlier practice. A recently discovered newspaper interview with Wheaton indicates that the rules he and Tucker wrote for the Knickerbockers in most respects duplicated the rules he had written for the Gotham Club in 1837; the Knickerbockers were founded as a breakaway group of former Gothams.

Writing the rules did not help the Knickerbockers in the first known competitive game between two clubs under the new rules, played at <a href="Elysian%20Fields%2C%20Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elysian Fields</a> in <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a> on June 19, 1846. The "New York nine" (almost certainly the parent Gotham Club) humbled the Knickerbockers by a score of 23 to 1. Nevertheless, the Knickerbocker Rules were rapidly adopted by teams in the New York area and their version of baseball became known as the "New York Game" (as opposed to the "Massachusetts Game", played by clubs in the Boston area).

As late as 1855, the New York press was still devoting more space to coverage of <a href="cricket">cricket</a> than to baseball.

In 1857, sixteen New York area clubs, including the Knickerbockers, formed the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Base Ball Players</a> (NABBP). The NABBP was the first organization to govern the sport and to establish a championship. The 1857 convention also established three key features of the game: 90 feet between the bases, 9-man teams, and 9-inning games (under the Knickerbocker Rules, games were played to 21 runs). Aided by the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, membership grew to almost 100 clubs by 1865 and to over 400 by 1867, including clubs from as far away as <a href="California">California</a>. During the Civil War, soldiers from different parts of the United States played baseball together, leading to a more unified national version of the sport. Beginning in 1869, the NABBP permitted <a href="professional">professional</a> play, addressing a growing practice that had not been permitted under its rules to that point. The first and most prominent professional club of the NABBP era was the <a href="Cincinnati%20Red%20Stockings">Cincinnati Red Stockings</a> in Ohio, which lasted only two years. Businessman <a href="Ivers%20Whitney%20Adams">Ivers Whitney Adams</a> then courted manager Harry Wright and founded the "Boston Red Stockings" and the <a href="Boston%20Base%20Ball%20Club">Boston Base Ball Club</a> on January 20, 1871.

In 1858, in the <a href="Corona%2C%20Queens">Corona</a> neighborhood of <a href="Queens">Queens</a> (now part of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>), at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the all stars of <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, including players from the <a href="Brooklyn%20Atlantics">Atlantic</a>, <a href="Excelsior%20of%20Brooklyn">Excelsior</a>, Putnam and <a href="Eckford%20of%20Brooklyn">Eckford</a> clubs, and the All Stars of New York (<a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>), including players from the <a href="New%20York%20Knickerbockers">New York Knickerbockers</a>, Gothams, Eagles and Empire, are commonly believed to the first all star baseball games.

Before the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, baseball competed for public interest with <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and regional variants of baseball, notably <a href="town%20ball">town ball</a> played in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and the <a href="Massachusetts%20Game">Massachusetts Game</a> played in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. In the 1860s, aided by the war, <a href="Knickerbocker%20Rules">"New York" style</a> baseball expanded into a national game, as its first governing body. The <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Base Ball Players</a> was formed. The NABBP soon expanded into a true national organization, although most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern part of the country. In its 12-year history as an amateur league, the <a href="Brooklyn%20Atlantics">Atlantic Club of Brooklyn</a> won seven championships, establishing themselves as the first true dynasty in the sport, although <a href="New%20York%20Mutuals">Mutual of New York</a> was widely considered to be one of the best teams of the era as well. By the end of <a href="1865%20in%20baseball">1865</a>, almost 100 clubs were members of the NABBP. By 1867, it ballooned to over 400 members, including some clubs from as far away as <a href="List%20of%20baseball%20parks%20in%20San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a> and <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. One of these clubs, the Chicago White Stockings, won the championship in 1870. Today known as the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, they are the oldest team in American organized sports. Because of this growth, regional and state organizations began to assume a more prominent role in the governance of the sport.

The NABBP of America was initially established upon principles of <a href="amateurism">amateurism</a>. However, even early in its history some star players, such as <a href="Jim%20Creighton">James Creighton</a> of <a href="Excelsior%20of%20Brooklyn">Excelsior</a>, received compensation, either secretly or indirectly. In <a href="1866%20in%20sports">1866</a>, the NABBP investigated <a href="Athletic%20of%20Philadelphia">Athletic of Philadelphia</a> for paying three players including <a href="Lip%20Pike">Lip Pike</a>, but ultimately took no action against either the club or the players. To address this growing practice, and to restore integrity to the game, at its December <a href="1868%20in%20sports">1868</a> meeting the NABBP established a professional category for the <a href="1869%20in%20sports">1869</a> season. Clubs desiring to pay players were now free to declare themselves <a href="professional">professional</a>.

The <a href="Cincinnati%20Red%20Stockings">Cincinnati Red Stockings</a> were the first to so declare themselves as openly professional, and were easily the most aggressive in recruiting the best available players. Twelve clubs, including most of the strongest clubs in the NABBP, ultimately declared themselves professional for the <a href="1869%20in%20sports">1869</a> season.

The first attempt at forming a "<a href="Major%20North%20American%20professional%20sports%20teams">major league</a>" produced the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</a>, which lasted from 1871 to 1875. The now all professional Chicago White Stockings, financed by businessman <a href="William%20Hulbert">William Hulbert</a>, became a charter member of the league along with the Red Stockings, who had dissolved and moved to Boston. The White Stockings were close contenders all season, despite the fact that the <a href="Great%20Chicago%20Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a> had destroyed the team's home field and most of their equipment. The White Stockings finished the season in second place, but ultimately were forced to drop out of the league during the city's recovery period, finally returning to National Association play in 1874. Over the next couple seasons, The <a href="Ivers%20Whitney%20Adams%23Baseball">Boston Red Stockings</a> dominated the league and hoarded many of the game's best players, even those who were under contract with other teams. After <a href="Davy%20Force">Davy Force</a> signed with Chicago, and then breached his contract to play in Boston, Hulbert became discouraged by the "contract jumping" as well as the overall disorganization of the N.A., and thus spearheaded the movement to form a stronger organization. The end result of his efforts was the formation a much more "ethical" league, which became known as the <a href="National%20League">National Base Ball League</a>. After a series of rival leagues were organized but failed (most notably the <a href="American%20Association%20%2819th%20century%29">American Base Ball Association</a>, which spawned the clubs which would ultimately become the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> and <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>), the current <a href="American%20League">American League</a>, evolving from the minor Western League of 1893, was established in 1901.

In 1870, a <a href="wikt%3Aschism">schism</a> developed between professional and amateur ballplayers. The NABBP split into two groups. The <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Professional%20Baseball%20Players">National Association of "Professional" Base Ball Players</a> operated from 1871 through 1875, and is considered by some to have been the first major league. Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.

William Hulbert's National League, which was formed after the National Association proved ineffective, put its emphasis on "clubs" rather than "players". Clubs now had the ability to enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs in turn were required to play their full schedule of games, rather than forfeiting scheduled games once out of the running for the league championship, as happened frequently under the National Association. A concerted effort was made to reduce the amount of gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt.

At the same time, a "<a href="gentlemen%27s%20agreement">gentlemen's agreement</a>" was struck between the clubs to <a href="Baseball%20color%20line">exclude non-white players</a> from professional baseball, a bar that remained until 1947. It is a common misconception that <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> was the first African-American major-league ballplayer; he was actually only the first after a long gap (and the first in the modern era). <a href="Moses%20Fleetwood%20Walker">Moses Fleetwood Walker</a> and his brother Welday Walker were unceremoniously dropped from major and minor-league rosters in the 1880s, as were other African-Americans in baseball. An unknown number of African-Americans played in the major leagues by representing themselves as Indians, or South or Central Americans, and a still larger number played in the minor leagues and on amateur teams as well. In the majors, however, it was not until the signing of Robinson (in the National League) and <a href="Larry%20Doby">Larry Doby</a> (in the American League) that baseball began to remove its color bar.

The early years of the National League were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitive leagues formed regularly, and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the American Association (1881–1891), sometimes called the "beer and whiskey league" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the National League and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series—the first attempt at a <a href="Baseball/World%20Series">World Series</a>.

The <a href="Union%20Association">Union Association</a> survived for only one season (1884), as did the <a href="Players%27%20League">Players' League</a> (1890), an attempt to return to the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association</a> structure of a league controlled by the players themselves. Both leagues are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers because of the perceived high caliber of play and the number of star players featured. However, some researchers have disputed the major league status of the Union Association, pointing out that franchises came and went and contending that the St. Louis club, which was deliberately "stacked" by the league's president (who owned that club), was the only club that was anywhere close to major league caliber.

In fact, there were dozens of leagues, large and small, at this time. What made the National League "major" was its dominant position in the major cities, particularly New York City, the edgy, emotional nerve center of baseball. The large cities offered baseball teams national media distribution systems and fan bases that could generate revenues enabling teams to hire the best players in the country.

A number of other leagues, including the venerable Eastern League, threatened the dominance of the National League. The Western League, founded in 1893, became particularly aggressive. Its fiery leader <a href="Ban%20Johnson">Ban Johnson</a> railed against the National League and promised to build a new league that would grab the best players and field the best teams. The Western League began play in April 1894 with teams in <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit</a> (the only league team that has not moved since), <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Kansas City</a>, <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="Minneapolis%20Millers">Minneapolis</a>, <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Sioux City</a> and <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Toledo</a>. Prior to the 1900 season, the league changed its name to the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> and moved several franchises to larger, strategic locations. In 1901 the American League declared its intent to operate as a major league.

The resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes. One of the most famous involved star second baseman <a href="Napoleon%20Lajoie">Napoleon Lajoie</a>, who in 1901 went across town in Philadelphia from the National League Phillies to the American League Athletics. Barred by a court injunction from playing baseball in the state of Pennsylvania the next year, Lajoie was traded to the Cleveland team, where he played and managed for many years.

The war between the American and National caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. On September 5, 1901 <a href="Patrick%20T.%20Powers">Patrick T. Powers</a>, president of the <a href="Eastern%20League%20%28baseball%29">Eastern League</a> announced the formation of the second <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues</a>, the NABPL or "NA" for short.

These leagues did not consider themselves "minor" – a term that did not come into vogue until St. Louis Cardinals GM <a href="Branch%20Rickey">Branch Rickey</a> pioneered the farm system in the 1930s. Nevertheless, these financially troubled leagues, by beginning the practice of selling players to the more affluent National and American leagues, embarked on a path that eventually led to the loss of their independent status.

Ban Johnson had other designs for the NA. While the NA continues to this day, he saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might some day want to expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.

After 1902 both leagues and the NABPL signed a new National Agreement which achieved three things:

The new agreement tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause national league contracts. Baseball players were a commodity, like cars. $5,000 bought a player's skill set. It set up a rough classification system for independent leagues that regulated the dollar value of contracts, the forerunner of the system refined by Rickey and used today.

It also gave the NA great power. Many independents walked away from the 1901 meeting. The deal with the NA punished those other indies who had not joined the NA and submitted to the will of the 'majors.' The NA also agreed to the deal to prevent more pilfering of players with little or no compensation for the players' development. Several leagues, seeing the writing on the wall, eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.

In the very early part of the 20th century, known as the "<a href="dead-ball%20era">dead-ball era</a>", baseball rules and equipment favored the "inside game" and the game was played more violently and aggressively than it is today. This period ended in the 1920s with several changes that gave advantages to hitters. In the largest parks, the outfield fences were brought closer to the infield. In addition, the strict enforcement of new rules governing the size, shape and construction of the ball caused it to travel farther.

The first professional black baseball club, the Cuban Giants, was organized in 1885. Subsequent professional black baseball clubs played each other independently, without an official league to organize the sport. <a href="Rube%20Foster">Rube Foster</a>, a former ballplayer, founded the <a href="Negro%20National%20League%20%281920%E2%80%931931%29">Negro National League</a> in 1920. A second league, the <a href="Eastern%20Colored%20League">Eastern Colored League</a>, was established in 1923. These became known as the <a href="Negro%20League%20baseball">Negro Leagues</a>, though these leagues never had any formal overall structure comparable to the Major Leagues. The Negro National League did well until 1930, but folded during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>.

From 1942 to 1948, the <a href="Negro%20League%20World%20Series">Negro League World Series</a> was revived. This was the golden era of Negro League baseball, a time when it produced some of its greatest stars. In <a href="1947%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1947</a>, <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> signed a contract with the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>, breaking the <a href="Baseball%20color%20line">color barrier</a> that had prevented talented African American players from entering the white-only major leagues. Although the transformation was not instantaneous, baseball has since become fully <a href="racial%20integration">integrated</a>. In 1948, the Negro Leagues faced financial difficulties that effectively ended their existence.

Pitchers dominated the game in the 1960s and early 1970s. In <a href="1973%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1973</a>, the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> (DH) rule was adopted by the American League, while in the National League pitchers still bat for themselves to this day. The DH rule now constitutes the primary difference between the two leagues.

During the late 1960s, the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Baseball Players Union</a> became much stronger and conflicts between owners and the players' union led to major work stoppages in 1972, 1981, and 1994. The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1994 baseball strike</a> led to the cancellation of the World Series, and was not settled until the spring of 1995. In the late 1990s, functions that had been administered separately by the two major leagues' administrations were united under the rubric of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>.

At this time the games tended to be low scoring, dominated by such pitchers as <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, <a href="Cy%20Young">Cy Young</a>, <a href="Christy%20Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a>, and <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%20Alexander">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a> to the extent that the period 1900–1919 is commonly called the "Dead-ball era". The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. Baseballs cost three dollars apiece, a hefty sum at the time, which in 1900 would be equal to $ today; club owners were therefore reluctant to spend much money on new balls if not necessary. It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game. By the end of the game, the ball would be dark with grass, mud, and tobacco juice, and it would be misshapen and lumpy from contact with the bat. Balls were only replaced if they were hit into the crowd and lost, and many clubs employed security guards expressly for the purpose of retrieving balls hit into the stands—a practice unthinkable today.

As a consequence, home runs were rare, and the "inside game" dominated—singles, <a href="bunt%20%28baseball%29">bunts</a>, <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>s, the hit-and-run play, and other tactics dominated the strategies of the time.

Despite this, there were also several superstar hitters, the most famous being <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>, held to be one of the greatest <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a>s to ever play the game, and Detroit's <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, the "Georgia Peach." Cobb was a mean-spirited man, fiercely competitive and loathed by many of his fellow professionals, but his career <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of .366 has yet to be bested.

The <a href="1908%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1908 pennant races</a> in both the AL and NL were among the most exciting ever witnessed. The conclusion of the National League season, in particular, involved a bizarre chain of events, often referred to as the Merkle Boner. On September 23, 1908, the <a href="1908%20New%20York%20Giants%20season">New York Giants</a> and <a href="1908%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">Chicago Cubs</a> played a game in the <a href="Polo%20Grounds%20III">Polo Grounds</a>. Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman <a href="Fred%20Merkle">Fred Merkle</a>, later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two outs and the game tied. Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game. However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, ran toward the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice. The Cubs' second baseman, <a href="Johnny%20Evers">Johnny Evers</a>, noticed this. In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored. Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out. Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game. Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary. It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the <a href="1908%20World%20Series">World Series</a> (the last Cubs Series victory until 2016).

For his part, Merkle was doomed to endless criticism and vilification throughout his career for this lapse, which went down in history as "<a href="Merkle%27s%20Boner">Merkle's Boner</a>". In his defense, some baseball historians have suggested that it was not customary for game-ending hits to be fully "run out", it was only Evers's insistence on following the rules strictly that resulted in this unusual play. In fact, earlier in the 1908 season, the identical situation had been brought to the umpires' attention by Evers; the umpire that day was the same Hank O'Day. While the winning run was allowed to stand on that occasion, the dispute raised O'Day's awareness of the rule, and directly set up the Merkle controversy.

Turn of the century baseball attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the <a href="1901%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1901 season</a> was 3,247. However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built for many of the larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including <a href="Tiger%20Stadium%20%28Detroit%29">Tiger Stadium</a> in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="Shibe%20Park">Shibe Park</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Ebbets%20Field">Ebbets Field</a> in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, the <a href="Polo%20Grounds%20III">Polo Grounds</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a href="Boston">Boston</a>'s <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a> along with <a href="Wrigley%20Field">Wrigley Field</a> and <a href="Comiskey%20Park">Comiskey Park</a> in Chicago. Likewise from the <a href="Eastern%20League%20%28baseball%29">Eastern League</a> to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising <a href="Negro%20Leagues">Negro Leagues</a> professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre World War I peak of 5,836 in <a href="1909%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1909</a>, before falling back during the war. Where there weren't professional teams, there were semi-pro teams, traveling teams <a href="barnstorm%20%28sports%29">barnstorming</a>, company clubs and amateur men's leagues. In the days before television, if you wanted to see a game, you had to go to the ballpark.

The fix of baseball games by gamblers and players working together had been suspected as early as the 1850s. <a href="Hal%20Chase">Hal Chase</a> was particularly notorious for throwing games, but played for a decade after gaining this reputation; he even managed to parlay these accusations into a promotion to manager. Even baseball stars such as <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> and <a href="Tris%20Speaker">Tris Speaker</a> have been credibly alleged to have fixed game outcomes. When MLB's complacency during this "Golden Age" was eventually exposed after the <a href="1919%20World%20Series">1919 World Series</a>, it became known as the <a href="Black%20Sox%20scandal">Black Sox scandal</a>.

After an excellent regular season (88–52, .629 W%), the <a href="1919%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">Chicago White Sox</a> were heavy favorites to win the 1919 World Series. Arguably the best team in baseball, The White Sox had a deep lineup, a strong pitching staff, and a good defense. Even though the National League champion <a href="1919%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a> had a superior regular season record (96–44, .689 W%,) no one, including <a href="gamblers">gamblers</a> and <a href="bookmaker">bookmaker</a>s, anticipated the Reds having a chance. When the Reds triumphed 5–3, many pundits cried foul.

At the time of the scandal, the White Sox were arguably the most successful franchise in baseball, with excellent gate receipts and record attendance. At the time, most baseball players were not paid especially well and had to work other jobs during the winter to survive. Some elite players on the big-city clubs made very good salaries, but Chicago was a notable exception.

For many years, the White Sox were owned and operated by <a href="Charles%20Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a>, who paid the lowest player salaries, on average, in the American League. The White Sox players all intensely disliked Comiskey and his penurious ways, but were powerless to do anything, thanks to baseball's so-called "reserve clause", that prevented players from switching teams without their team owner's consent.

By late 1919, Comiskey's tyrannical reign over the Sox had sown deep bitterness among the players, and White Sox first baseman <a href="Chick%20Gandil">Arnold "Chick" Gandil</a> decided to conspire to throw the 1919 World Series. He persuaded gambler <a href="Joseph%20%26quot%3BSport%26quot%3B%20Sullivan">Joseph "Sport" Sullivan</a>, with whom he had had previous dealings, that the fix could be pulled off for $100,000 total (which would be equal to $ today), paid to the players involved. New York gangster <a href="Arnold%20Rothstein">Arnold Rothstein</a> supplied the $100,000 that Gandil had requested through his lieutenant <a href="Abe%20Attell">Abe Attell</a>, a former featherweight <a href="boxing">boxing</a> champion.

After the 1919 series, and through the beginning of the <a href="1920%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1920 baseball season</a>, rumors swirled that some of the players had conspired to purposefully lose. At last, in 1920, a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> was convened to investigate these and other allegations of fixed baseball games. Eight players (<a href="Swede%20Risberg">Charles "Swede" Risberg</a>, <a href="Chick%20Gandil">Arnold "Chick" Gandil</a>, <a href="Shoeless%20Joe%20Jackson">"Shoeless" Joe Jackson</a>, <a href="Happy%20Felsch">Oscar "Happy" Felsch</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Cicotte">Eddie Cicotte</a>, <a href="Buck%20Weaver">George "Buck" Weaver</a>, <a href="Fred%20McMullin">Fred McMullin</a>, and <a href="Lefty%20Williams">Claude "Lefty" Williams</a>) were indicted and tried for conspiracy. The players were ultimately acquitted.

However, the damage to the reputation of the sport of baseball led the team owners to appoint Federal judge <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> to be the first <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">Commissioner of Baseball</a>. His first act as commissioner was to ban the "Black Sox" from professional baseball for life. The White Sox, meanwhile would not return to the World Series until 1959 and it was not until their next appearance in 2005 they won the World Series.

Until July 5, 1947, baseball had two histories. One fills libraries, while baseball historians are only just beginning to chronicle the other fully. African Americans have played baseball as long as white Americans. Players of color, both <a href="African-American">African-American</a> and <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic</a>, played for white baseball clubs throughout the early days of the organizing amateur sport. <a href="Moses%20Fleetwood%20Walker">Moses Fleetwood Walker</a> is considered the first African-American to play at the major league level, in 1884.

The <a href="Negro%20Leagues">Negro Leagues</a> were American professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> leagues comprising predominantly African-American teams. The term may be used broadly to include professional black teams outside the leagues and it may be used narrowly for the <a href="%23Significant%20Negro%20Leagues">seven relatively successful leagues beginning 1920</a> that are sometimes termed "Negro Major Leagues".

The first professional team, established in <a href="1885%20in%20baseball">1885</a>, achieved great and lasting success as the <a href="Cuban%20Giants">Cuban Giants</a>, while the first league, the <a href="National%20Colored%20Base%20Ball%20League">National Colored Base Ball League</a>, failed in <a href="1887%20in%20baseball">1887</a> after only two weeks due to low attendance. The <a href="Negro%20American%20League">Negro American League</a> of <a href="1951%20in%20baseball">1951</a> is considered the last major league season and the last professional club, the <a href="Indianapolis%20Clowns">Indianapolis Clowns</a>, operated amusingly rather than competitively from the mid-1960s to 1980s.

While many of the players that made up the black baseball teams were African-Americans, many more were <a href="Latin%20Americans">Latin Americans</a> from nations that deliver some of the greatest talents that make up the major league rosters of today. Black players moved freely through the rest of baseball, playing in <a href="Canadian%20Baseball">Canadian Baseball</a>, <a href="Mexican%20Baseball">Mexican Baseball</a>, <a href="Caribbean%20Baseball">Caribbean Baseball</a>, and Central America and South America where more than a few found that level of fame that they were unable to attain in the country of their birth.

It was not the Black Sox scandal by which an end was put to the dead-ball era, but by a rule change and a single player.

Some of the increased offensive output can be explained by the 1920 rule change outlawing tampering with the ball, which pitchers had often done to produce "spitballs", "shine balls" and other trick pitches which had 'unnatural' flight through the air. Umpires were also required to put new balls into play whenever the current ball became scuffed or discolored. This rule change was enforced all the more stringently following the death of <a href="Ray%20Chapman">Ray Chapman</a>, who was struck in the temple by a pitched ball from <a href="Carl%20Mays">Carl Mays</a> in a game on August 16, 1920 (he died the next day). Discolored balls, harder for batters to see and therefore harder for batters to dodge, have been rigorously removed from play ever since. There are two side effects. One, of course, is that if the batter can see the ball more easily, the batter can hit the ball more easily. The second is that without scuffs and other damage, pitchers are limited in their ability to control spin and so to cause altered trajectories.

At the end of the 1919 season Harry Frazee, then owner of the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, sold a group of his star players to the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. Amongst them was <a href="Babe%20Ruth">George Herman Ruth</a>, known affectionately as "Babe". The story that Frazee did so in order to fund theatrical shows on Broadway for his actress lady friend is unfounded. <a href="No%2C%20No%2C%20Nanette">No, No, Nanette</a> was indeed first produced in 1925 by Harry Frazee, though the sale of baseball superstar Babe Ruth to the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> had occurred five years earlier. In the lore of the <a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Bambino">Curse of the Bambino</a>, Frazee supposedly needed to sell Ruth among other reasons to make up for his lack of financial success up to that point in making Broadway shows, and it was hitting it big with "No, No, Nanette" in 1925 that paid off the loan.

Ruth's career mirrors the shift in dominance from pitching to hitting at this time. He started his career as a pitcher in 1914, and by 1916 was considered one of the dominant left-handed pitchers in the game. When Edward Barrow, managing the Red Sox, converted him to an outfielder, ballplayers and sportswriters were shocked. It was apparent, however, that Ruth's bat in the lineup every day was far more valuable than Ruth's arm on the mound every fourth day. Ruth swatted 29 home runs in his last season in Boston. The next year, as a Yankee, he would hit 54 and in 1921 he hit 59. His 1927 mark of 60 home runs would last until 1961.
Ruth's power hitting ability demonstrated a new way to play the game, and one that was extremely popular with the crowds. Accordingly, the ballparks were expanded, sometimes by building outfield seating which shrunk the size of the outfield and made home run hitting more practical. In addition to Ruth, hitters such as <a href="Rogers%20Hornsby">Rogers Hornsby</a> also took advantage, with Hornsby compiling extraordinary figures for both power and average in the early 1920s. By the late 1920s and 1930s all the good teams had their home run hitting "sluggers": the Yankees' <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Hank%20Greenberg">Hank Greenberg</a> in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and Chicago's <a href="Hack%20Wilson">Hack Wilson</a> were the most storied. While the American League championship, and to a lesser extent the <a href="Baseball/World%20Series">World Series</a>, would be dominated by the Yankees, there were many other excellent teams in the inter-war years. Also, the National League's <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> would win three titles themselves in nine years, the last with a group of players known as the "<a href="Gashouse%20Gang">Gashouse Gang</a>".

The first radio broadcast of a baseball game was on August 5, 1921 over Westinghouse station KDKA from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. Harold Arlin announced the Pirates-Phillies game. Attendances in the 1920s were consistently better than they had been before the war. The interwar peak average attendance was 8,211 in 1930, but baseball was hit hard by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and in 1933 the average fell below five thousand for the only time between the wars.

1933 also saw the introduction of the All-Star game, a mid-season break in which the greatest players in each league play against one another in a hard fought but officially meaningless demonstration game. In 1936 the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> was instituted and five players elected: <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, <a href="Christy%20Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a>, <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> and <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>. The Hall formally opened in 1939.

The beginning of US involvement in World War II necessitated depriving the game of many players who joined the armed forces, but the major leagues continued play throughout the duration. In 1941, a year which saw the premature death of <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>, Boston's great left fielder <a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a> had a batting average over .400 – the last time anyone has achieved that feat. During the same season <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> hit successfully in 56 consecutive games, an accomplishment both unprecedented and unequaled. Both Williams and DiMaggio would miss playing time in the services, with Williams also flying later in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. During this period <a href="Stan%20Musial">Stan Musial</a> led the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> to the 1942, 1944 and 1946 World Series titles. The war years also saw the founding of the <a href="All-American%20Girls%20Professional%20Baseball%20League">All-American Girls Professional Baseball League</a>.

Baseball boomed after World War II. 1945 saw a new attendance record and the following year average crowds leapt nearly 70% to 14,914. Further records followed in 1948 and 1949, when the average reached 16,913. While average attendances slipped to somewhat lower levels through the 1950s, 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, they remained well above pre-war levels, and total seasonal attendance regularly hit new highs from 1962 onwards as the number of major league games increased.

The post-War years in baseball also witnessed the racial integration of the sport. Participation by <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s in organized baseball had been precluded since the 1890s by formal and informal agreements, with only a few players surreptitiously being included in lineups on a sporadic basis.

American society as a whole moved toward integration in the post-War years, partially as a result of the distinguished service by <a href="African%20American">African American</a> military units such as the <a href="Tuskegee%20Airmen">Tuskegee Airmen</a>, <a href="366th%20Infantry%20Regiment">366th Infantry Regiment</a>, and others. During the baseball winter meetings in 1943, noted <a href="African%20American">African American</a> athlete and actor <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a> campaigned for integration of the sport. After World War II ended, several team managers considered recruiting members of the <a href="Negro%20Leagues">Negro Leagues</a> for entry into organized baseball. In the early 1920s, <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a>' manager <a href="John%20McGraw%20%28baseball%29">John McGraw</a> slipped a black player, <a href="Charlie%20Grant">Charlie Grant</a>, into his lineup (reportedly by passing him off to the front office as an Indian), and McGraw's wife reported finding names of dozens of Negro players that McGraw fantasized about signing, after his death. <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> owner Bill Bensawanger reportedly signed <a href="Josh%20Gibson">Josh Gibson</a> to a contract in 1943, and the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> were also said to be interested in his services. But those efforts (and others) were opposed by <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a>, baseball's powerful commissioner and a staunch segregationist. <a href="Bill%20Veeck">Bill Veeck</a> claimed that Landis blocked his purchase of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> because he planned to integrate the team. While this is disputed, Landis was opposed to integration, and his death in 1944 (and subsequent replacement as Commissioner by <a href="Happy%20Chandler">Happy Chandler</a>) removed a major obstacle for black players in the major leagues.

The general manager who would be eventually successful in breaking the color barrier was <a href="Branch%20Rickey">Branch Rickey</a> of the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>. Rickey himself had experienced the issue of segregation. While playing and coaching for his college team at Ohio Wesleyan University, Rickey had a black teammate named Charles Thomas. On one particular road trip through southern Ohio his fellow player was refused a room in a hotel. Although Rickey was able to get the player into his room for that night, he was taken aback when he reached his room to find Thomas upset and crying about this injustice. Rickey related this incident as an example of why he wanted a full de-segregation of the nation, not only in baseball.

In the mid-1940s, Rickey had compiled a list of Negro League ballplayers for a potential major league contract. Realizing that the first <a href="African%20American">African American</a> signee would be a magnet for prejudicial sentiment, however, Rickey was intent on finding a player with a distinguished personality and character that would allow him to tolerate the inevitable abuse. Rickey's sights eventually settled on <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>, a shortstop with the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Monarchs">Kansas City Monarchs</a>. Although probably not the best player in the Negro Leagues at the time, Robinson was an exceptional talent, was college-educated, and had the marketable distinction of serving as an officer during World War II. More importantly, Robinson possessed the inner strength to handle the inevitable abuse to come. To prepare him for the task, Robinson first played in 1946 for the Dodgers' <a href="minor%20league">minor league</a> team, the <a href="Montreal%20Royals">Montreal Royals</a>, which proved an arduous emotional challenge, but he also enjoyed fervently enthusiastic support from the <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> fans. On April 15, 1947, Robinson broke the <a href="Baseball%20color%20line">color barrier</a>, which had been tacitly recognized for over 50 years, with his appearance for the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> at <a href="Ebbets%20Field">Ebbets Field</a>.

Eleven weeks later, on July 5, 1947, the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> was integrated by the signing of <a href="Larry%20Doby">Larry Doby</a> to the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. Over the next few years a handful of black baseball players made appearances in the majors, including <a href="Roy%20Campanella">Roy Campanella</a> (teammate to Robinson in Brooklyn) and <a href="Satchel%20Paige">Satchel Paige</a> (teammate to Doby in Cleveland). Paige, who had pitched more than 2400 innings in the Negro Leagues, sometimes two and three games a day, was still effective at 42, and still playing at 59. His ERA in the Major Leagues was 3.29.

However, the initial pace of <a href="Racial%20integration">integration</a> was slow. By 1953, only six of the sixteen major league teams had a black player on the roster. The <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> became the last major league team to integrate its roster with the addition of <a href="Pumpsie%20Green">Pumpsie Green</a> on July 21, 1959. While limited in numbers, the on-field performance of early black major league players was outstanding. In the fourteen years from 1947–1960, black players won one or more of the <a href="MLB%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Rookie of the Year</a> awards nine times.

While never prohibited in the same fashion as African Americans, <a href="Latin%20Americans">Latin American</a> players also benefitted greatly from the integration era. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born <a href="Chico%20Carrasquel">Chico Carrasquel</a> and Cuban-born (and black) <a href="Minnie%20Mi%C3%B1oso">Minnie Miñoso</a>, became the first Hispanic <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Stars</a>.

According to some baseball historians, Robinson and the other African American players helped reestablish the importance of baserunning and similar elements of play that were previously de-emphasized by the predominance of power hitting.

From 1947 to the 1970s, African American participation in baseball rose steadily. By 1974, 27% of baseball players were African American. As a result of this on-field experience, minorities began to experience long-delayed gains in managerial positions within baseball. In 1975, <a href="Frank%20Robinson">Frank Robinson</a> (who had been the 1956 <a href="MLB%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Rookie of the Year</a> with the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>) was named player-manager of the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, making him the first African American manager in the major leagues.

Although these front-office gains continued, Major League Baseball saw a lengthy slow decline in the percentage of black players after the mid-1970s. By 2007, black players made up less than 9% of the major leagues. While this trend is largely attributed to an increased emphasis on the recruitment of players from Latin America (with the number of Hispanic players in the major leagues rising to 29% by 2007), other factors have been cited as well. <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> player <a href="Dave%20Winfield">Dave Winfield</a>, for instance, has cited the fact that urban America places less emphasis and provides less resources for youth baseball than in the past. Despite this continued prevalence of Hispanic players, the percentage of black players rose again in 2008 to 10.2%.

<a href="Arturo%20Moreno">Arturo Moreno</a> became the first Hispanic owner of a MLB franchise when he purchased the <a href="Anaheim%20Angels">Anaheim Angels</a> in 2004.

In 2005, a Racial and Gender Report Card on Major League Baseball was issued, which generally found positive results on the inclusion of African Americans and Latinos in baseball, and gave Major League Baseball a grade of "A" or better for opportunities for players, managers and coaches as well as for MLB's central office. At that time, 37% of major league players were people of color: Latino (26 percent), African-American (9 percent) or Asian (2 percent). Also by 2004, 29% of the professional staff in MLB's central office were people of color, 11% of team vice presidents were people of color, and seven of the league's managers were of color (four African-Americans and three Latinos).

Baseball had been in the West for almost as long as the National League and the American League had been around. It evolved into the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>, which included the <a href="Hollywood%20Stars">Hollywood Stars</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20%28PCL%29">Los Angeles Angels</a>, <a href="Oakland%20Oaks%20%28PCL%29">Oakland Oaks</a>, <a href="Portland%20Beavers">Portland Beavers</a>, <a href="Sacramento%20Solons">Sacramento Solons</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco%20Seals%20%28baseball%29">San Francisco Seals</a>, <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres%20%28PCL%29">San Diego Padres</a>, <a href="Seattle%20Rainiers">Seattle Rainiers</a>.

The PCL was huge in the West. A member of the <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues</a>, it kept losing great players to the National and the American leagues for less than $8,000 a player.

The PCL was far more independent than the other "minor" leagues, and rebelled continuously against their Eastern masters. Clarence <a href="Pants%20Rowland">Pants Rowland</a>, the President of the PCL, took on baseball commissioners <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> and <a href="Happy%20Chandler">Happy Chandler</a> at first to get better equity from the major leagues, then to form a third major league. His efforts were rebuffed by both commissioners. Chandler and several of the owners, who saw the value of the markets in the West, started to plot the extermination of the PCL. They had one thing that Rowland did not: The financial power of the Eastern major league baseball establishment.

No one was going to back a PCL club building a major-league size stadium if the National or the American League was going to build one too, and potentially put the investment in the PCL ballpark into jeopardy.

Until the 1950s, major league baseball franchises had been largely confined to the northeastern United States, with the teams and their locations having remained unchanged from 1903 to 1952. The first team to relocate in fifty years was the <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Boston Braves</a>, who moved in 1953 to Milwaukee, where the club set attendance records. In 1954, the St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore and were renamed the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. In 1955, the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a> moved to Kansas City.

In 1958 the New York market ripped apart. The Yankees were becoming the dominant draw, and the cities of the West offered generations of new fans in much more sheltered markets for the other venerable New York clubs, the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> and the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a>. Placing these storied, powerhouse clubs in the two biggest cities in the West had the specific design of crushing any attempt by the PCL to form a third major league. Eager to bring these big names to the West, Los Angeles gave <a href="Walter%20O%27Malley">Walter O'Malley</a>, owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour of the city and asked him to pick his spot. The Giants were given the lease to the PCL <a href="San%20Francisco%20Seals%20%28baseball%29">San Francisco Seals</a> digs while <a href="Candlestick%20Park">Candlestick Park</a> was built for them.

The logical first candidates for major league "expansion" were the same metropolitan areas that had just attracted the Dodgers and Giants. It is said that the Dodgers and Giants—National League rivals in New York City—chose their new cities because Los Angeles (in <a href="southern%20California">southern California</a>) and San Francisco (in <a href="northern%20California">northern California</a>) already had a fierce rivalry (geographical, economic, cultural and political), dating back to the state's founding. The only California expansion team—and also the first in Major League Baseball in over 70 years—was the |<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Angels">Los Angeles Angels</a> (later the California Angels, the Anaheim Angels, and, as of 2005, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim), who brought the American League to southern California in 1961. Northern California, however, would later gain its own American League team, in 1968, when the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Athletics</a> would move again, settling in Oakland, across <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> from the Giants.

Along with the Angels, the other 1961 expansion team was the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281961%E2%80%9371%29">Washington Senators</a>, who joined the American League and took over the nation's capital when the moved to Minnesota and became the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Twins</a>. 1961 is also noted as being the year in which <a href="Roger%20Maris">Roger Maris</a> surpassed Babe Ruth's single season home run record, hitting 61 for the New York Yankees, albeit in a slightly longer season than Ruth's. To keep pace with the American League—which now had ten teams—the National League likewise expanded to ten teams, in 1962, with the addition of the <a href="Houston%20Colt%20.45s">Houston Colt .45s</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>.

In 1969, the American League expanded when the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> and <a href="Seattle%20Pilots">Seattle Pilots</a>, the latter in a longtime PCL stronghold, were admitted to the league. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving to Milwaukee and becoming today's <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a>. The National League also added two teams that year, the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a> and <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a>. The Padres were the last of the core PCL teams to be absorbed. The Coast League did not die, though. It reformed, and moved into other markets, and endures to this day as a Class AAA league.

In 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area and became the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a>.

In 1977, the American League expanded to fourteen teams, with the newly formed <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> and <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>. Sixteen years later, in 1993, the National League likewise expanded to fourteen teams, with the newly formed <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Colorado Rockies</a> and <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a> (now Miami Marlins).

Beginning with the 1994 season, both the AL and the NL were divided into three divisions (East, West, and Central), with the addition of a <a href="wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild card</a> team (the team with the best record among those finishing in second place) to enable four teams in each league to advance to the preliminary <a href="Division%20Series">division series</a>. However, due to the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike%20">1994–95 Major League Baseball strike </a> (which canceled the <a href="1994%20World%20Series">1994 World Series</a>), the new rules did not go into effect until the <a href="1995%20World%20Series">1995 World Series</a>.

In 1998, the AL and the NL each added a fifteenth team, for a total of thirty teams in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>. The <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> joined the National League, and the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Devil%20Rays">Tampa Bay Devil Rays</a>—now called simply the Rays—joined the American League. In order to keep the number of teams in each league at an even number (14 – AL, 16 – NL), Milwaukee changed leagues and became a member of the National League.

In 2013, in keeping with Commissioner <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a>'s desire for expanded interleague play, the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> were shifted from the National to the American League; with an odd number (15) in each league, an interleague contest was played somewhere almost every day during the season. At this time the divisions within each league were shuffled to create six equal divisions of five teams.

By the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968 <a href="Carl%20Yastrzemski">Carl Yastrzemski</a> won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in history. That same year, <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> pitcher <a href="Denny%20McLain">Denny McLain</a> won 31 games – making him the last pitcher to win 30 games in a season. <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> starting pitcher <a href="Bob%20Gibson">Bob Gibson</a> achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12.

In response to these events, major league baseball implemented certain rules changes in 1969 to benefit the batters. The pitcher's mound was lowered, and the <a href="strike%20zone">strike zone</a> was reduced.

In 1973 the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, made a move to increase scoring even further by initiating the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> rule.

From the time of the formation of the Major Leagues to the 1960s, when it came to the control of the game of baseball the team owners held the whip hand. After the so-called "Brotherhood Strike" of 1890 and the failure of the <a href="Brotherhood%20of%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players">Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players</a> and its Players National League, the owners control of the game seemed absolute. It lasted over 70 years despite a number of short-lived players organizations. In 1966, however, the players enlisted the help of <a href="trade%20union">labor union</a> activist <a href="Marvin%20Miller">Marvin Miller</a> to form the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Major League Baseball Players Association</a> (MLBPA). The same year, <a href="Sandy%20Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> and <a href="Don%20Drysdale">Don Drysdale</a> – both <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> winners for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> – refused to re-sign their contracts, and the era of the reserve clause, which held players to one team, was coming toward an end.

The first legal challenge came in 1970. Backed by the MLBPA, <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> outfielder <a href="Curt%20Flood">Curt Flood</a> took the leagues to court to negate a player trade, citing the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">13th Amendment</a> and <a href="antitrust">antitrust</a> legislation. In 1972 he finally lost his case in the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> by a vote of 5 to 3, but gained large-scale public sympathy, and the damage had been done. The reserve clause survived, but it had been irrevocably weakened. In 1975 <a href="Andy%20Messersmith">Andy Messersmith</a> of the Dodgers and <a href="Dave%20McNally">Dave McNally</a> of the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a> played without contracts, and then declared themselves free agents in response to <a href="Seitz%20decision">an arbitrator's ruling</a>. Handcuffed by concessions made in the Flood case, the owners had no choice but to accept the collective bargaining package offered by the MLBPA, and the reserve clause was effectively ended, to be replaced by the current system of free-agency and arbitration.

While the legal challenges were going on, the game continued. In 1969 the <a href="1969%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">"Miracle Mets"</a>, just 7 years after their formation, recorded their first winning season, won the National League East and finally the World Series.

On the field, the 1970s saw some of the longest standing records fall and the rise of two powerhouse dynasties. In Oakland, the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Swinging A's</a> were overpowering, winning the Series in '72, '73 and '74, and five straight division titles. The strained relationships between teammates, who included <a href="Catfish%20Hunter">Catfish Hunter</a>, <a href="Vida%20Blue">Vida Blue</a> and <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>, gave the lie to the need for "chemistry" between players. The National League, on the other hand, belonged to <a href="the%20Big%20Red%20Machine">the Big Red Machine</a> in Cincinnati, where <a href="Sparky%20Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a>'s team, which included <a href="Pete%20Rose">Pete Rose</a> as well as <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Famers</a> Tony Pérez, <a href="Johnny%20Bench">Johnny Bench</a> and <a href="Joe%20Morgan">Joe Morgan</a>, succeeded the A's run in 1975.

The decade also contained great individual achievements as well. On April 8, 1974, <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a> of the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> hit his 715th career home run, surpassing <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>'s all-time record. He would retire in 1976 with 755 and that was just one of numerous records he achieved, many of which, including <a href="Total%20bases">Total bases</a> scored, still stand today. There was great pitching too: between 1973 and 1975, <a href="Nolan%20Ryan">Nolan Ryan</a> threw 4 <a href="no-hitter">"no-hit" games</a>. He would add a record-breaking fifth in 1981 and two more before his retirement in 1993, by which time he had also accumulated 5,714 strikeouts, another record, in a 27-year career.

From the 1980s onward, the major league game has changed dramatically from a combination of effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility. These events lead to greater labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, changes in the way that the game is played, and problems with the use of performance-enhancing substances like <a href="steroids">steroids</a> tainting the race for records. Through this period crowds generally rose. Average attendances first broke 20,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1993. That year total attendance hit 70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records.

During the 1980s, the science of conditioning and workouts greatly improved. Weight rooms and training equipment were improved. Trainers and doctors developed better diets and regimens to make athletes bigger, healthier, and stronger than they had ever been.

Another major change that had been occurring during this time was the adoption of the <a href="pitch%20count">pitch count</a>. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now pitching coaches watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 100 to 125, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms. Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.

Along with the expansion of teams, the addition of more pitchers needed to play a complete game stressed the total number of quality players available in a system that restricted its talent searches at that time to America, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

Baseball had been watched live since the mid 20th century. Television sports' arrival in the 1950s increased attention and revenue for all major league clubs at first. The television programming was extremely regional. It hurt the minor and independent leagues most. People stayed home to watch <a href="Maury%20Wills">Maury Wills</a> rather than watch unknowns at their local baseball park. Major League Baseball, as it always did, made sure that it controlled rights and fees charged for the broadcasts of all games, just as it did on radio. It brought additional revenues and attention both from the broadcast itself, and from the increases in attendance and merchandise sales that expanded audiences allowed.

The national networks began televising national games of the week, opening the door for a national audience to see particular clubs. While most teams were broadcast, emphasis was always on the league leaders and the major market franchises that could draw the largest audience.

In the 1970s the cable revolution began. The Atlanta Braves became a power contender with greater revenues generated by <a href="TBS%20%28TV%20network%29">WTBS</a>, <a href="Ted%20Turner">Ted Turner</a>'s Atlanta-based Super-Station, that broadcast "America's Team" to cable households nationwide. The roll out of <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, then regional sports networks (now mostly under the umbrella of <a href="Fox%20Sports%20Net">Fox Sports Net</a>) changed sports news and particularly impacted baseball. Boiled down to the thirty-second game highlight, and now under the microscope of news organizations that needed to fill 24 hours of time, the amount of attention paid to major league players magnified to staggering levels from where it had been just 20 years prior.

It brought with it increased attention for individual players, who reached super-star status nationwide on careers that often were not as compelling as those who had come before them in a less media intense time.

As player contract values soared, and the number of broadcasters, commentators, columnists, and sports writers also soared. The competition for a fresh angle on any story became fierce. Media pundits began questioning the high salaries that the players received. Coverage began to become intensely negative. Players personal lives, which had always been off-limits unless something extreme happened, became the fodder of editorials, insider stories on television, and features in magazines. When the use of performance-enhancing drugs became an issue, the gap between the sports media and the players whom they covered widened further.

With the development of <a href="satellite%20television">satellite television</a> and <a href="digital%20cable">digital cable</a>, Major League Baseball launched baseball channels with season subscription fees, making it possible for fans to watch virtually every game played as they played.

The next round became the single-team cable networks. <a href="YES%20Network">YES Network</a> & <a href="New%20England%20Sports%20Network">NESN</a>, the New York Yankees & Boston Red Sox cable television networks, respectively, took in millions to broadcast games not only in New York and Boston but around the country. These networks generated as much revenue or more annually for large market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox as their entire baseball operations did. By making these separate companies, these owners were able to exclude the money from consideration of deals.

Television and greater media coverage in magazines and newspapers trying to attract a new generation of non-readers also brought in the sponsors, and even more money, that would attract players to new financial opportunities and bring in other elements to the business of baseball that would impact the game.

Baseball memorabilia and souvenirs, including baseball cards, exploded in price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading. This would explode yet again in the late 1990s, as the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>, and the website <a href="eBay">eBay</a> provided venues for collectors of all things baseball to trade with each other. Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values. This in turn brought in new businessmen whose sole means of making a living was acquiring autographs and memorabilia from the athletes. Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.

Beyond the staple billboards, large corporations like NIKE and Champion fought to make sure that their logos were seen on the clothing and shoes worn by athletes on the field. This kind of association branding became a new revenue stream. In the late 1990s and into the dawn of the 21st century, the dugout, the backstops behind home plate, and anywhere else that might be seen by a camera all became fair game for inserting advertising.

Players who had been dramatically underpaid for generations were now replaced by players who were paid extremely well for their services.
By the 1970s a new generation of <a href="sports%20agents">sports agents</a> were hawking the talents of players who knew baseball but didn't know how the business end of the game was played. The agents broke down what the teams were generating in revenue off of the players' performances. They calculated what their player might be worth to energize a television contract, or provide more merchandise revenue, or put more fans into seats.
The athletes signed shoe deals, baseball card sponsorships, and commercial endorsements for products of every size and shape.
Sky high salaries also changed many of the strategies of the game. Players rarely were "sent" down to the minors if they failed to perform. Who could justify paying a slumping player millions to sit in Toledo where the major league fans couldn't pay their way? Other players in the Triple-A level of the minor leagues, who used to rise on merit, became trapped under these overpaid "stars." Also, in order to make the media happy, trades, rather than call-ups, became the order of the day. It was much better to buy someone else's shortstop who was a known quantity to the national sports media than to take a chance on a player with no name value and no visibility if you were in a major market ballclub.

Tactics on the field changed too. Risky moves that could get players hurt, and sideline millions of dollars in payroll on the disabled list, became less common. Stealing home, a popular tactic of great stars of the day like Ty Cobb or Pete Rose, became infrequent occurrences.

The perception of players by the general public changed from larger-than-life heroes to a more cynical view of many of them as spoiled and overpaid. This was fed by the growing legions of television reporters, commentators, and print sports writers who also started asking questions about what justified the kind of money being paid to these players.

With players seeking greener pastures when their contracts came up, fewer players became career members of one ballclub. In the modern era, it is unusual to see a player stay with any one club for more than a few years if they are good enough to command a better salary.

Players with any ability increasingly gravitated towards the money. Large market clubs like the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, and the Chicago Cubs given big revenues from their cable television operations signed more and more of the big name players away from mid-sized and smaller market baseball clubs that could not afford to compete with them for salaries.

All was not well with the game. The many contractual disputes between players and owners came to a head in 1981. Previous players' strikes (in 1972, 1973 and 1980) had been held in preseason, with only the 1972 <a href="1972%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">stoppage</a> – over benefits – causing disruption to the regular season from April 1 to April 13. Also, in 1976 the owners had locked the players out of <a href="Spring%20training">Spring training</a> in a dispute over <a href="free%20agent">free agency</a>.

The crux of the 1981 dispute was about compensation for the loss of players to free agency. After losing a top-rank player in such a way the owners wanted a mid-rank player in return, the so-called "sixteenth player" (each club was allowed to protect 15 players from this rule). Losing lower rated free agents would have correspondingly smaller compensation. The players, only recently freed from the bondage of the reserve clause, found this unacceptable, and withdrew their labor, <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">striking</a> on June 12. Immediately, the U.S. Government <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Board">National Labor Relations Board</a> ruled that the owners had not been negotiating in good faith, and installed a federal mediator to reach a solution. Seven weeks and 713 games were lost in the middle of the season, before the owners backed down on July 31, settling for much lower ranked players as compensation. By then much of the season had been lost, and the season was continued as distinct halves starting August 9, with the playoffs reorganized to reflect this.

Throughout the 1980s then, baseball seemed to prosper. The competitive balance between franchises saw fifteen different teams make the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>, and nine different champions during the decade. Also, every season from 1978 through 1987 saw a different World Series winner, a streak unprecedented in baseball history. Turmoil was, however, just around the corner. In 1986 <a href="Pete%20Rose">Pete Rose</a> retired from playing for the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, having broken <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>'s record by accumulating 4,256 hits during his career. He continued as Reds manager until, in 1989 it was revealed that he was being investigated for sports gambling, including the possibility that he had bet on teams with which he was involved. While Rose admitted a gambling problem, he denied having bet on baseball. Federal prosecutor John Dowd investigated and, on <a href="Dowd%20Report">his recommendation</a>, Rose was banned from organised baseball, a move which precluded his possible inclusion in the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Fame</a>. In a meeting with Commissioner <a href="A.%20Bartlett%20Giamatti">Giamatti</a>, Rose, having failed in a legal action to prevent it, accepted his punishment. It was, essentially, the same fate that had befallen the Black Sox seventy years previously. (Rose, however, would continue to deny that he bet on baseball until he finally confessed to it in his 2004 autobiography.)

Labor relations were still strained. There had been a two-day strike in 1985 (over the division of television revenue money), and a <a href="1990%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20lockout">32-day spring training lockout</a> in 1990 (again over salary structure and benefits). By far the worst action would come in 1994. The seeds were sown earlier: in 1992 the owners sought to renegotiate salary and <a href="free%20agent">free-agency</a> terms, but little progress was made. The standoff continued until the beginning of 1994 when the existing agreement expired, with no agreement on what was to replace it. Adding to the problems was the perception that "small market" teams, such as the struggling <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> could not compete with high spending teams such as those in <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York</a> or <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles</a>. Their plan was to institute TV <a href="revenue%20sharing">revenue sharing</a> to increase equity amongst the teams and impose a <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a> to keep expenditures down. Players felt that such a cap would reduce their potential earnings.

The players officially went on strike on August 12, 1994. In September 1994 Major League Baseball announced the cancellation of the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> for the first time since 1904.

The cancellation of the <a href="1994%20World%20Series">1994 World Series</a> was a severe embarrassment for Major League Baseball. Americans were cursed, outraged, frightened, angered, frustrated, and plagued to their core as a result of the strike. Fans had declared the strike as an act of war. Although there were few signs of the predicted "outrage" on the part of the fans, attendance figures and broadcast ratings were lower in 1995 than before the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">strike</a>. However, it would be a decade until baseball would recover from the strike.

On September 6, 1995, <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> <a href="Cal%20Ripken%2C%20Jr.">Cal Ripken, Jr.</a> played his 2,131st consecutive game, breaking <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>'s 56-year-old record. This was the first high-profile moment in baseball after the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">strike</a>. Ripken continued his streak for another three years, voluntarily ending it at 2,632 <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20consecutive%20games%20played%20streaks">consecutive games played</a> on September 20, 1998.

In 1997, the <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a> won the <a href="1997%20World%20Series">World Series</a> in just their fifth season. This made them the youngest expansion team to win the Fall Classic (with the exception of the 1903 <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> and later the 2001 <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, who won in their fourth season). Virtually all the key players on the <a href="1997%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">1997 Marlins</a> team were soon traded or let go to save payroll costs (although the <a href="2003%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">2003 Marlins</a> did win a second <a href="2003%20World%20Series">world championship</a>).

In 1998, <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a> and <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Sammy%20Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a> engaged in a <a href="1998%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20home%20run%20record%20chase">home run race</a> for the ages. With both rapidly approaching <a href="Roger%20Maris">Roger Maris</a>'s record of 61 home runs (set in 1961), seemingly the entire nation watched as the two power hitters raced to be the first to break the record. McGwire reached 62 first on September 8, 1998, with Sosa also eclipsing it later. Sosa finished with 66 home runs, just behind McGwire's unheard-of 70. However, recent <a href="anabolic%20steroid">steroid</a> allegations have marred the season in the minds of many fans.

That same year, the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> won a record 125 games, including going 11–2 in the postseason, to win the World Series as what many consider to be one of the greatest teams of all time.

McGwire's record of 70 would last a mere three years following the meteoric rise of veteran <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a> <a href="left%20fielder">left fielder</a> <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a> in 2001. In 2001 Bonds knocked out 73 <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20annual%20home%20run%20leaders">home runs</a>, breaking the record set by McGwire by hitting his 71st on October 5, 2001. In addition to the home run record, Bonds also set single-season marks for <a href="base%20on%20balls">base on balls</a> with 177 (breaking the previous record of 170, set by <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> in 1923) and <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> with .863 (breaking the mark of .847 set by Ruth in 1920). Bonds continued his torrid home run hitting in the next few seasons, hitting his 660th career home run on April 12, 2004, tying him with his godfather <a href="Willie%20Mays">Willie Mays</a> for third place on the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20career%20home%20run%20leaders">all-time career home runs</a> list. He hit his 661st home run the next day, April 13, to take sole possession of third place. Only three years later Bonds surpassed the great Hank Aaron to become baseball's most prolific home run hitter.

However, both Bonds' accomplishments in the 2000s have not been without controversy. During his run, journalists questioned McGwire about his use of the steroid-precursor <a href="androstenedione">androstenedione</a>, and in March 2005 was unforthcoming when questioned as part of a Congressional inquiry into steroids. Bonds has also been dogged by allegations of steroid use and his involvement in the <a href="BALCO">BALCO</a> drugs scandal, as his personal trainer <a href="Greg%20Anderson%20%28trainer%29">Greg Anderson</a> pleaded guilty to supplying steroids (without naming Bonds as a recipient). Neither Bonds nor McGwire has failed a drug test at any time since there was no steroid-testing until 2003 after the new August 7, 2002 agreement between owners and players was reached. McGwire retired after the 2001 season; in 2010, he admitted to having used steroids throughout his MLB career.

The 1990s also saw Major League Baseball expand into new markets as four new teams joined the league. In 1993, the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Colorado Rockies</a> and <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a> began play, and in just their fifth year of existence, the Marlins became the first wild card team to win the championship. 

The year 1998 brought two more teams into the mix, the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Devil%20Rays">Tampa Bay Devil Rays</a> and the <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, the latter of which become the youngest expansion franchise to win the championship. 

For the most part, the late 1990s were dominated by the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, who won four out of five <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> championships from 1996–2000.

The lure of big money pushed players harder and harder to perform at their peaks. There is only so much conditioning that one can do to obtain an edge without inducing injury. The wearying travel schedule and 162-game season meant that <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>s, usually in the form of pep pills known as "greenies", had been widespread in baseball since at least the 1960s. Baseball's drug scene was no particular secret, having been discussed in "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" and in <a href="Jim%20Bouton">Jim Bouton</a>'s groundbreaking book "<a href="Ball%20Four">Ball Four</a>", but there was virtually no public backlash. Two decades later, however, some Major League players turned to newer <a href="performance-enhancing%20drugs">performance-enhancing drugs</a>, including <a href="ephedra">ephedra</a> and improved <a href="Ergogenic%20use%20of%20anabolic%20steroids">steroids</a>.

A memo circulated in 1991 by baseball commissioner <a href="Fay%20Vincent">Fay Vincent</a> said, "The possession, sale or use of any illegal drug or controlled substance by Major League players and personnel is strictly prohibited ... [and those players involved] are subject to discipline by the Commissioner and risk permanent expulsion from the game... This prohibition applies to all illegal drugs and controlled substances, including steroids…" Some general managers of the time do not remember this memo, and it was not emphasized or enforced.

Ephedra, a Chinese herb used to cure cold symptoms, and also used in some allergy medications, sped up the heart and was considered by some to be a weight-loss short-cut. Overweight pitcher <a href="Steve%20Bechler">Steve Bechler</a>, who wanted to stay on the Baltimore Orioles roster, took just such a shortcut. He collapsed on February 17, 2003 while pitching, and was soon pronounced dead. Bechler's death raised concerns over the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Ephedra was banned, and soon the furor died down.

The 1998 home run race had generated nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' run for the all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease. Some athletes have said that the main advantage to steroids is not so much the additional power or endurance that they can provide, but that they can drastically shorten rehab time from injury.

Commissioner <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a> imposed a very strict anti-drug policy upon its minor league players, who are not part of the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Major League Baseball Players Association</a> (the PA). Random drug testing, education and treatment, and strict penalties for those caught were the rule of law. Anyone on a Major League team's forty man roster, including 15 minor leaguers that are on that list, were exempt from that program. Some called Selig's move a public relations stunt, or window dressing.

In a "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" cover story in 2002, a year after his retirement, <a href="Ken%20Caminiti">Ken Caminiti</a> admitted that he had used steroids during his National League MVP-winning 1996 season, and for several seasons afterwards. Caminiti died unexpectedly of an apparent heart attack in <a href="The%20Bronx">The Bronx</a> at the age of 41; he was pronounced dead on October 10, 2004 at New York's <a href="Lincoln%20Hospital%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Lincoln Memorial Hospital</a>. On November 1, the New York City Medical Examiners Office announced that Caminiti died from "acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and opiates", but coronary artery disease and cardiac hypertrophy (an enlarged heart) were also contributing factors.

In 2005, <a href="Jose%20Canseco">Jose Canseco</a> published "", admitting steroid usage and claiming that it was prevalent throughout major league baseball. When the United States Congress decided to investigate the use of steroids in the sport, some of the game's most prominent players came under scrutiny for possibly using steroids. These include <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>, <a href="Jason%20Giambi">Jason Giambi</a>, and <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a>. Other players, such as Canseco and <a href="Gary%20Sheffield">Gary Sheffield</a>, have admitted to have either knowingly (in Canseco's case) or not (Sheffield's) using steroids. In confidential testimony to the <a href="BALCO">BALCO</a> <a href="Grand%20Jury">Grand Jury</a> (that was later leaked to the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>"), Giambi also admitted steroid use. He later held a press conference in which he appeared to affirm this admission, without actually saying the words. And after an appearance before Congress where he (unlike McGwire) emphatically denied using steroids, "period", slugger <a href="Rafael%20Palmeiro">Rafael Palmeiro</a> became the first major star to be suspended (10 days) on August 1, 2005 for violating Major League Baseball's newly strengthened ban on controlled substances, including steroids, adopted on August 7, 2002, starting in the 2003 season. Many lesser players (mostly from the minor leagues) have tested positive for use, as well.

In 2006, the Commissioner of Baseball tasked former United States Senator George J. Mitchell to lead an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball (MLB) and on December 13, 2007, the 409-page <a href="Mitchell%20Report%20%28baseball%29">Mitchell Report</a> was released ('Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball'). The report described the use of anabolic steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) in MLB and assessed the effectiveness of the MLB Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Mitchell also advanced certain recommendations regarding the handling of past illegal drug use and future prevention practices. The report names 89 MLB players who are alleged to have used steroids or drugs.

Baseball has been taken to task for turning a blind eye to its drug problems. It benefited from these drugs in the ever-increasingly competitive fight for airtime and media attention. MLB and its Players Association finally announced tougher measures, but many felt that they did not go far enough. 

In December 2009, Sports Illustrated named Baseball's Steroid Scandal as the number one sports story of the decade of the 2000s. In 2013, no player from the first "steroid class" of players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame was elected. Bonds and Clemens received less than half the number of votes needed, and some voters stated that they would not vote for any first-time candidate who played during the steroid era—whether accused of using banned substances or not—because of the effect the substances had on baseball.

In 2002, a major scandal arose when it was discovered that a company called <a href="BALCO">BALCO</a> (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), owned by <a href="Victor%20Conte">Victor Conte</a>, had been producing so-called "<a href="designer%20steroids">designer steroids</a>", (specifically <a href="tetrahydrogestrinone">"the clear"</a> and "<a href="the%20cream">the cream</a>") which are steroids that could not be detected through drug tests at that time. In addition, the company had connections to several San Francisco Bay Area sports trainers and athletes, including the trainers of <a href="Jason%20Giambi">Jason Giambi</a> and <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>. This revelation lead to a vast criminal investigation into BALCO's connections with athletes from baseball and many other sports. Among the many athletes who have been linked to BALCO are Olympic sprinters <a href="Tim%20Montgomery">Tim Montgomery</a> and <a href="Marion%20Jones">Marion Jones</a>, Olympic shot-putter <a href="C.%20J.%20Hunter">C. J. Hunter</a>, and Major League Baseball players Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds.

During grand jury testimony in December 2003 – which was illegally leaked to the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a> and published in December 2004 – Giambi allegedly admitted to using many different steroids, including fertility drugs (which could account for his declining health in the past few years). The reports that came from the San Francisco Chronicle were done by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, who revealed that the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative did not merely manufacture nutritional supplements, but also distributed exotic steroids. Williams and Fairanu-Wada also provided compelling evidence that Bonds, arguably the greatest player of his generation, was one of BALCO's steroid clients. The paper reported that these substances were probably designer steroids. Bonds said that <a href="Greg%20Anderson%20%28trainer%29">Greg Anderson</a> gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance that at the time he did not believe them to be steroids and thought they were flaxseed oil and other health supplements. Based on the testimony from many of the athletes, Conte and Anderson accepted plea agreements from the government in 2005 on charges they distributed steroids and laundered money to avoid significant time in jail. Conte received a sentence of four months in jail, Anderson received a sentence of three months. Also that year, James Valente, the vice president of Balco, and Remi Korchemny, a track coach affiliated with BALCO, pleaded guilty to distributing banned substances and received probation.

Various baseball pundits, fans, and even players have taken this as confirmation that Bonds used illegal steroids. Bonds never tested positive in tests performed in 2003, 2004, and 2005, which may be attributable to successful obfuscation of continued use as documented in the 2006 book "<a href="Game%20of%20Shadows">Game of Shadows</a>".

While the introduction of steroids certainly increased the power production of greats there were other factors that drastically increased the power surge after 1994. The factors cited are: smaller sized ballparks than in the past, the <a href="juiced%20ball%20theory">"juiced balls" theory</a> claiming that the balls are wound tighter thus travel further following contact with the bat, "watered down pitching" implying that lesser quality pitchers are up in the Major Leagues due to too many teams. Albeit that these factors did play a large role in increasing home run thus scoring totals during this time, others that directly impact ballplayers have an equally important role. As noted earlier one of those factors is anabolic steroids which have the capability of increasing muscle mass, which enables hitters to not only hit "mistake" pitches farther, but it also enables hitters to adjust to "good" pitches such as a well-placed fastball, slider, changeup, or curveball, and hit them for home runs. Another such factor is better nutrition, as well as training and training facilities/equipment which can work with (or without) steroids to produce a more potent ballplayer and further enhance his skills.

Routinely in today's baseball age we see players reach 40 and 50 home runs in a season, a feat that even in the 1980s was considered rare. On the other hand, since the end of the steroid era, the emphasis on swinging for home runs has been accompanied by hitting in general falling off, with batting averages trending downwards towards 1960s levels and strikeouts reaching all-time highs: "each" of the eleven seasons 2006-2016 broke the preceding MLB-total record for strikeouts.

Many modern baseball theorists believe that a new pitch will swing the balance of power back to the pitcher. A pitching revolution would not be unprecedented—several pitches have changed the game of baseball in the past, including the <a href="slider">slider</a> in the 1950s and 1960s and the <a href="fastball">split-fingered fastball</a> in the 1970s to 1990s. Since the 1990s, the <a href="changeup">changeup</a> has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers such as <a href="Tim%20Lincecum">Tim Lincecum</a>, <a href="Pedro%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Pedro Martínez</a>, <a href="Trevor%20Hoffman">Trevor Hoffman</a>, <a href="Greg%20Maddux">Greg Maddux</a>, <a href="Matt%20Cain">Matt Cain</a>, <a href="Tom%20Glavine">Tom Glavine</a>, <a href="Johan%20Santana">Johan Santana</a>, <a href="Justin%20Verlander">Justin Verlander</a> and <a href="Cole%20Hamels">Cole Hamels</a>.

Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award

The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) award, given to one outstanding player in the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> and one in the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>. Since 1931, it has been awarded by the <a href="Baseball%20Writers%27%20Association%20of%20America">Baseball Writers' Association of America</a> (BBWAA). The winners receive the <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> Memorial Baseball Award, which became the official name of the award in 1944, in honor of the first <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball%20%28MLB%29">MLB commissioner</a>, who served from 1920 until his death on November 25, 1944.

MVP voting takes place before the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason">postseason</a>, but the results are not announced until after the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>. The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938, reducing that number to two per league city in 1961. The BBWAA does not offer a clear-cut definition of what "most valuable" means, instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters.

<a href="First%20basemen">First basemen</a>, with 34 winners, have won the most MVPs among <a href="infielder">infielder</a>s, followed by <a href="second%20basemen">second basemen</a> (16), <a href="third%20basemen">third basemen</a> (15), and <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a>s (15). Of the 24 <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a>s who have won the award, 15 are <a href="right-handed">right-handed</a> while 9 are <a href="left-handed">left-handed</a>. <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, <a href="Carl%20Hubbell">Carl Hubbell</a>, and <a href="Hal%20Newhouser">Hal Newhouser</a> are the only pitchers who have won multiple times, Newhouser winning consecutively in 1944 and 1945.

<a href="Hank%20Greenberg">Hank Greenberg</a>, <a href="Stan%20Musial">Stan Musial</a>, <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a>, and <a href="Robin%20Yount">Robin Yount</a> have won at different positions, while Rodriguez is the only player who has won the award with two different teams at two different positions. <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a> has won the most often (seven times) and the most consecutively (2001–04). <a href="Jimmie%20Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a> was the first player to win multiple times; 9 players have won three times, and 19 have won twice. <a href="Frank%20Robinson">Frank Robinson</a> is the only player to win the award in both the American and National Leagues.

The award's only tie occurred in the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> in 1979, when <a href="Keith%20Hernandez">Keith Hernandez</a> and <a href="Willie%20Stargell">Willie Stargell</a> received an equal number of points. There have been 18 unanimous winners, who received all the first-place votes. The <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> have the most winning players with 22, followed by the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> with 17 winners. The award has never been presented to a member of the following four teams: <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, <a href="Miami%20Marlins">Miami Marlins</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>, and <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a>. The most recent recipients are <a href="Mike%20Trout">Mike Trout</a> in the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> and <a href="Kris%20Bryant">Kris Bryant</a> in the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>.

In recent decades, pitchers have rarely won the award. When <a href="Justin%20Verlander">Justin Verlander</a> won the AL award in 2011, he became the first pitcher in either league to be named the MVP since <a href="Dennis%20Eckersley">Dennis Eckersley</a> in 1992. Verlander also became the first <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> to win this award since Roger Clemens had accomplished the feat in 1986. The National League went even longer without an MVP award to a pitcher—after <a href="Bob%20Gibson">Bob Gibson</a> won in 1968, no pitcher in that league was named MVP until <a href="Clayton%20Kershaw">Clayton Kershaw</a> in 2014.

Before the <a href="1910%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1910 season</a>, Hugh Chalmers of <a href="Chalmers%20Automobile">Chalmers Automobile</a> announced he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> in Major League Baseball at the end of the season. The <a href="1910%20Chalmers%20Award">1910 race for best average in the American League</a> was between the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>' widely disliked <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> and <a href="Nap%20Lajoie">Nap Lajoie</a> of the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven <a href="Bunt%20%28baseball%29">bunt</a> hits against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>. American League President <a href="Ban%20Johnson">Ban Johnson</a> said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway, and Chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players.

The <a href="1911%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">following season</a>, Chalmers created the Chalmers Award. A committee of baseball writers were to convene after the season to determine the "most important and useful player to the club and to the league". Since the award was not as effective at advertising as Chalmers had hoped, it was discontinued after 1914.

In 1922 the American League created a new award to honor "the baseball player who is of the greatest all-around service to his club". Winners, voted on by a committee of eight baseball writers chaired by <a href="James%20Crusinberry">James Crusinberry</a>, received a bronze medal and a cash prize. Voters were required to select one player from each team and <a href="player-coach">player-coach</a>es and prior award winners were ineligible. These incredible flaws resulted in Babe Ruth only winning 1 MVP as the award was dropped after 1928. Under the All-Star Formula, Ruth would have won the MVP in 1920, 1921, 1923, 1925, 1928 and 1930 [citation needed]. The National League award, without these restrictions, lasted from 1924 to 1929.

The BBWAA first awarded the modern MVP after the <a href="1931%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1931 season</a>, adopting the format the National League used to distribute its league award. One writer in each city with a team filled out a ten-place ballot, with ten points for the recipient of a first-place vote, nine for a second-place vote, and so on. In 1938, the BBWAA raised the number of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then occurred in 1961, when the number of voters was reduced to two per league city.

Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award

In <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, the Rookie of the Year Award is annually given to one player from each league as voted on by the <a href="Baseball%20Writers%27%20Association%20of%20America">Baseball Writers' Association of America</a> (BBWAA). The award was established in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA, which selected an annual winner from 1940 through 1946. The award became national in 1947; <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>, the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>' <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a>, won the inaugural award. One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor has been given to one player each in the <a href="National%20League">National</a> and <a href="American%20League">American League</a>. Originally, the award was known as the <a href="J.%20Louis%20Comiskey">J. Louis Comiskey</a> Memorial Award, named after the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> owner of the 1930s. The award was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award in July 1987, 40 years after Jackie Robinson broke the <a href="baseball%20color%20line">baseball color line</a>.

Of the 140 players named Rookie of the Year (as of 2016), 16 have been elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a>—Jackie Robinson, five American League players, and ten others from the National League. The award has been shared twice: once by <a href="Butch%20Metzger">Butch Metzger</a> and <a href="Pat%20Zachry">Pat Zachry</a> of the National League in 1976; and once by <a href="John%20Castino">John Castino</a> and <a href="Alfredo%20Griffin">Alfredo Griffin</a> of the American League in 1979. Members of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers have won the most awards of any franchise (with 17), twice the total of the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, and members of the Philadelphia and <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> (eight), who have produced the most in the American League. <a href="Fred%20Lynn">Fred Lynn</a> and <a href="Ichiro%20Suzuki">Ichiro Suzuki</a> are the only two players who have been named Rookie of the Year and <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player</a> in the same year, and <a href="Fernando%20Valenzuela">Fernando Valenzuela</a> is the only player to have won Rookie of the Year and the <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> in the same year. <a href="Sam%20Jethroe">Sam Jethroe</a> is the oldest player to have won the award, at age 32, 33 days older than 2000 winner <a href="Kazuhiro%20Sasaki">Kazuhiro Sasaki</a> (also 32). <a href="Michael%20Fulmer">Michael Fulmer</a> of the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and <a href="Corey%20Seager">Corey Seager</a> of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> are the most recent winners.

From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter used discretion as to who qualified as a rookie. In 1957, the term was first defined as someone with fewer than 75 <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s or 45 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings pitched</a> in any previous Major League season. This guideline was later amended to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the previous year. The current standard of 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (excluding time in <a href="military%20service">military service</a> or on the <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a>) before September 1 was adopted in 1971.

Since 1980, each voter names three rookies: a first-place choice is given five points, a second-place choice three points, and a third-place choice one point. The award goes to the player who receives the most overall points. <a href="Edinson%20V%C3%B3lquez">Edinson Vólquez</a> received three second-place votes in 2008 balloting despite no longer being a rookie under the award's definition.

The award has drawn criticism in recent years because several players with experience in <a href="Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball">Nippon Professional Baseball</a> (NPB) have won the award, such as <a href="Hideo%20Nomo">Hideo Nomo</a> in 1995, <a href="Kazuhiro%20Sasaki">Kazuhiro Sasaki</a> in 2000, and Ichiro Suzuki in 2001. The current definition of rookie status for the award is based only on Major League experience, but some feel that past NPB players are not true rookies because of their past professional experience. Others, however, believe it should make no difference since the first recipient and the award's namesake played for the <a href="Negro%20Leagues">Negro Leagues</a> prior to his MLB career and thus could also not be considered a "true rookie". This issue arose in 2003 when <a href="Hideki%20Matsui">Hideki Matsui</a> narrowly lost the AL award to <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Berroa">Ángel Berroa</a>. <a href="Jim%20Souhan">Jim Souhan</a> of the "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>" said he did not see Matsui as a rookie in 2003 because "it would be an insult to the Japanese league to pretend that experience didn't count." "<a href="The%20Japan%20Times">The Japan Times</a>" ran a story in 2007 on the labeling of <a href="Daisuke%20Matsuzaka">Daisuke Matsuzaka</a>, <a href="Kei%20Igawa">Kei Igawa</a>, and <a href="Hideki%20Okajima">Hideki Okajima</a> as rookies, saying "[t]hese guys aren't rookies." Past winners such as Jackie Robinson, <a href="Don%20Newcombe">Don Newcombe</a>, and Sam Jethroe had professional experience in the <a href="Negro%20league%20baseball">Negro Leagues</a>.

National League Championship Series

The National League Championship Series (NLCS) is a <a href="Playoff%20format%23Best-of-seven%20playoff">best-of-seven series</a> played in October in the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason">Major League Baseball postseason</a> that determines the winner of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) pennant. The winner of the series advances to play the winner of the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) <a href="American%20League%20Championship%20Series">Championship Series</a> (ALCS) in the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>, <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s championship series.

Prior to 1969, the National League champion (the "<a href="List%20of%20National%20League%20pennant%20winners">pennant winner</a>") was determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season. There were four "ad hoc" three-game playoff series due to ties under this formulation (in 1946, 1951, 1959, and 1962). (The <a href="American%20League">American League</a> had to resolve a tie in 1948, but used a single-game playoff.)

A structured postseason series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven.

The NLCS and ALCS, since the expansion to seven games, are always played in a 2–3–2 format: games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home field advantage, and games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. Home field advantage is given to the team that has the better record, with the exception that the team that made the postseason as the <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29%23Major%20League%20Baseball">Wild Card</a> team cannot get home field advantage. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage was alternated between divisions each year regardless of regular season record and from 1995 to 1997 home field advantage was predetermined before the season.

In 1981, a <a href="1981%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">divisional series</a> was held due to a split season caused by a <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">players' strike</a>.

In 1994, the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, the <a href="National%20League%20Division%20Series">National League Division Series</a> (NLDS). The winners of that round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS.

Every current National League franchise has appeared in the NLCS at least once except the Washington Nationals, who have not made the NLCS since relocating from Montreal. The <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> made four NLCS appearances before moving to the AL in 2013.

As of the 2015 season, the Milwaukee Brewers are the only franchise to play in both the NLCS (in <a href="2011%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">2011</a>) and the ALCS (in <a href="1982%20ALCS">1982</a>). No franchise has won both the National and American League Championship Series.

The <a href="Warren%20C.%20Giles%20Trophy">Warren C. Giles Trophy</a>, named for the <a href="Warren%20Giles">president of the NL</a> from 1951 to 1969, is awarded to the NLCS winner.

A Most Valuable Player (<a href="MVP">MVP</a>) award is given to the outstanding player in each series, though voters can consider performances made during the divisional series. The MVP award has been given to a player on the losing team twice, in 1986 to Mike Scott of the Houston Astros and in 1987 to Jeff Leonard of the San Francisco Giants.

Although the National League began its LCS MVP award in 1977, the American League did not begin its LCS MVP award until 1980.

American League Championship Series

The American League Championship Series (ALCS) is a <a href="Playoff%20format%23Best-of-seven%20playoff">best-of-seven series</a> played in October in the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason">Major League Baseball postseason</a> that determines the winner of the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) pennant. The winner of the series advances to play the winner of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) <a href="National%20League%20Championship%20Series">Championship Series</a> (NLCS) in the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>, <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s championship series.

It started in 1969, when the AL reorganized into two divisions, <a href="American%20League%20East">East</a> and <a href="American%20League%20West">West</a>. The winners of each division played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven. In 1994, the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, known as the <a href="American%20League%20Division%20Series">American League Division Series</a> (ALDS). The winners of that round then advanced to the best-of-seven ALCS. In 2012, the <a href="playoff">playoff</a>s were expanded again so that two wild card teams face off in a one-game wild card round to determine which team advances to the division series, with the playoffs then continuing as it had before 2012 (though with the possibility of a fifth seed being in the playoffs and a fourth seed being out) after the end of the wild card round. This is the system currently in use.

The ALCS and NLCS, since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 2–3–2 format: Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has <a href="home%20field%20advantage">home field advantage</a>, and Games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. The series concludes when one team records its fourth win. Since 1998, home field advantage has been given to the team that has the better regular season record, unless that team happens to be the Wild Card team. In that case, the other team gets home field advantage, because by rule the Wild Card team is never allowed home field advantage in a Division Series or LCS. In the event that both teams have identical records in the regular season, home field advantage goes to the team that has the winning head-to-head record. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage alternated between the two divisions, and from 1995 to 1997 home field advantage was determined before the season.

Every current American League team except for the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> has played in the ALCS at least once. The <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a>, an American League team between 1969 and 1997, is the only franchise to play in the ALCS (<a href="1982%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1982</a>) and NLCS (<a href="2011%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">2011</a>). No franchise has won both the National League and American League Championship Series.

The <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20awards%23William%20Harridge%20Trophy">William Harridge Trophy</a> is awarded to the ALCS champion. The trophy's namesake comes from the American League president from 1931 to 1959.

The <a href="Lee%20MacPhail%23Lee%20MacPhail%20MVP%20Award">Lee MacPhail</a> Most Valuable Player (MVP) award is given to the outstanding player in the ALCS. No MVP award is given for Division Series play.

Although the National League began its LCS MVP award in 1977, the American League did not begin its LCS MVP award till 1980. The winners are listed (1) below in the section on "ALCS results (1969–present)", in the "Series MVP" column, (2) at <a href="League%20Championship%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award</a>, and (3) on the MLB website.

American League Division Series

In <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, the American League Division Series (ALDS) determines which teams will play in the <a href="American%20League%20Championship%20Series">American League Championship Series</a> (ALCS). It is played in a best-of-five format.

The Division Series was implemented in 1981 as a result of a <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">midseason strike</a>, with the first place teams before the strike taking on the teams in first place after the strike. After 1993, it was implemented for good when Major League Baseball restructured each league into three divisions. In 1981, a split-season format forced the first ever divisional playoff series, in which the <a href="1981%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York Yankees</a> won the Eastern Division series over the <a href="1981%20Milwaukee%20Brewers%20season">Milwaukee Brewers</a> (who were in the American League until 1998) in five games while in the Western Division, the <a href="1981%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland Athletics</a> swept the <a href="1981%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season">Kansas City Royals</a> (the only team with an overall losing record to ever make the postseason). The Yankees have currently played in the most division series in history, with eighteen appearances. In 2015 the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> and <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> became the last teams to make their first appearance in the ALDS. The Astros had been in the National League until switching to the American League in 2013 and had previously made the NLDS 7 times.

From 1998 to 2011, the wild-card team was assigned to play in the division winner with the best winning percentage (outside of their own division) in one series, and the other two division winners met in the other series. However, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record were from the same division, the wild-card team played the division winner with the second-best record, and the remaining two division leaders played each other. Beginning with the 2012 season, the wild card team that advances to the Division Series was to face the number 1 seed, regardless of whether or not they are in the same division. The two series winners move on to the best-of-seven ALCS. Home field advantage goes to the team with the better regular season record (or head-to-head record if there is a tie between two or more teams), except for the wild card team, which never receives the home field advantage.

Beginning in 2003, MLB has implemented a new rule to give the team from the league that wins the All-Star Game with the best regular season record a slightly greater advantage. In order to spread out the Division Series games for broadcast purposes, the two ALDS series follow one of two off-day schedules. Starting in 2007, after consulting the <a href="MLBPA">MLBPA</a>, MLB has decided to allow the team with the best record in the league that wins the All-Star Game to choose whether to use the seven-day schedule (1-2-off-3-4-off-5) or the eight-day schedule (1-off-2-off-3-4-off-5). The team only gets to choose the schedule; the opponent is still determined by win-loss records.

Initially, the best-of-5 series played in a 2-3 format, with the first two games set at home for the lower seed team and the last three for the higher seed. Since 1998, the series has followed a 2-2-1 format, where the higher seed team plays at home in Games 1 and 2, the lower seed plays at home in Game 3 and Game 4 (if necessary), and if a Game 5 is needed, the teams return to the higher seed's field. When MLB added a second wild card team in 2012, the Division Series re-adopted the 2-3 format due to scheduling conflicts. It reverted to the 2-2-1 format in 2013.

National League Division Series

In <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, the National League Division Series (NLDS) determines which two teams from the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> will advance to the <a href="National%20League%20Championship%20Series">National League Championship Series</a>. The Division Series consists of two best-of-five series, featuring the three division winners and the winner of the <a href="wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild-card</a> play-off.

The Division Series was implemented in 1981 – for only one year – as a result of a <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">midseason strike</a> with first-place teams before the strike taking on the first-place teams after. After 1993, Major League Baseball decided to implement the Division Series permanently, because it was restructuring each league into three divisions. (The implementation of this decision, however, was delayed a year, until 1995, due to the <a href="1994-95%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1994–1995 players' strike</a>.) Previously, because of a <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">players' strike</a> in <a href="1981%20in%20baseball">1981</a>, a split-season format forced a divisional playoff series, in which the <a href="1981%20Montreal%20Expos%20season">Montreal Expos</a> won the Eastern Division series over the <a href="1981%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">Philadelphia Phillies</a> three games to two while the <a href="1981%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> beat the <a href="1981%20Houston%20Astros%20season">Houston Astros</a> three games to two in the Western Division. The team with the best overall record in the major leagues, the <a href="1981%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a>, failed to win their division in either half of that season and were controversially excluded, as were the <a href="1981%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, who finished with the NL's second-best record. The <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> have currently played in the most NL division series with thirteen appearances. The <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> have currently won the most NL division series, winning ten of the twelve series in which they have played. The <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> (who finished with a losing record from 1993 to 2012) were the last team to make their first appearance in the NL division series, making their debut in 2013 after winning the <a href="2013%20National%20League%20Wild%20Card%20Game">2013 National League Wild Card Game</a>. In <a href="2008%20in%20baseball">2008</a>, the <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> became the first team to play in division series in both leagues when they won the National League wild card, their first postseason berth since winning the <a href="American%20League%20East%20Division">American League East Division</a> title in <a href="1982%20in%20baseball">1982</a> before switching leagues in <a href="1998%20in%20baseball">1998</a>. Milwaukee had competed in an <a href="1981%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">American League Division Series</a> in the <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">strike-shortened</a> <a href="1981%20in%20baseball">1981 season</a>.

The NLDS is a five-game series where the wild-card team is assigned to play the divisional winner with the best winning percentage in the regular season. The two remaining divisional winners meet in the other (NLDS) series with the team with the second best winning percentage, hosting that series. (From 1998 to 2011, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record were from the same division, the wild-card team played the division winner with the second-best record, and the remaining two division leaders played each other.) The two series winners move on to the best-of-seven NLCS. The winner of the wild card has won the first round seven out of the 11 years since the re-alignment and creation of the NLDS. According to <a href="Nate%20Silver">Nate Silver</a>, the advent of this playoff series, and especially of the wild card, has caused teams to focus more on "getting to the playoffs" rather than "winning the pennant" as the primary goal of the regular season.

Initially, the best-of-5 series played in a 2-3 format, with the first two games set at home for the lower-seed team and the last three for the higher seed. Since 1998, the series has followed a 2-2-1 format, where the higher seed team plays at home in Games 1 and 2, the lower seed plays at home in Game 3 and Game 4 (if necessary), and if a Game 5 is needed, the teams return to the higher seed's field. When MLB added a second wild card team in 2012, the Division Series re-adopted the 2-3 format due to scheduling conflicts. It reverted to the 2-2-1 format from 2013 onwards.

NOTE: With the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> move to the American League at the conclusion of the 2012 season, the Braves vs Astros series is no longer possible.

2001 World Series

The 2001 World Series was the 97th edition of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s <a href="World%20Series">championship series</a>, a <a href="best-of-seven%20playoff">best-of-seven playoff</a> between the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) <a href="2001%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">champion</a> <a href="2001%20Arizona%20Diamondbacks%20season">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> and the three-time defending World Series champions and <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) <a href="2001%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">champion</a> <a href="2001%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York Yankees</a>. The Diamondbacks defeated the Yankees four games to three to win the best-of-seven series. Considered one of the greatest World Series of all time, memorable aspects included two extra-inning games and three late-inning comebacks. It ended on a Game 7 <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28W%29%23walk-off%20home%20run">walk-off hit</a> in the form of a bases-loaded blooper single off the bat of <a href="Luis%20Gonzalez%20%28outfielder%29">Luis Gonzalez</a>. This was the third World Series to end in this way, following and . This was also the Yankees' fourth consecutive World Series appearance, after winning it in , , and .

This was the first World Series ever played in the state of Arizona and the Mountain Time Zone. With the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%23Tie%20games%2C%20rain%20delays%20and%20home-field%20advantage%20in%20World%20Series">All-Star Game</a> format change in 2003, the World Series would not open in the city of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> champion again until . This was the last World Series not to feature a <a href="wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wild card</a> team until . This was also the first World Series to end in November, due to the delay in the regular season after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>.

With the win by the Diamondbacks, the franchise became the first World Series champions from a <a href="Western%20United%20States">Far West state</a> other than California and the first major professional sports team from the state of Arizona to win a title.

<a href="Randy%20Johnson">Randy Johnson</a> and <a href="Curt%20Schilling">Curt Schilling</a> were both named as the <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">World Series co-MVPs</a>.

The Arizona Diamondbacks began play in 1998, along with the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rays">Tampa Bay Devil Rays</a>, as the youngest <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a> in Major League Baseball (MLB). After a mediocre debut season, the Diamondbacks finished the following year first in the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) <a href="National%20League%20West">West</a> with a record, but lost to the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> in the <a href="1999%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">NL Division series</a>. With several <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star">All-Star</a> players like <a href="Randy%20Johnson">Randy Johnson</a> and <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a>, the Diamondbacks had high expectations for the 2000 season, but finished third in the NL West with an record. During the <a href="offseason">offseason</a>, team manager <a href="Buck%20Showalter">Buck Showalter</a> was fired, and replaced by <a href="Sports%20commentator">sportscaster</a> and former player <a href="Bob%20Brenly">Bob Brenly</a>. The Diamondbacks acquired several notable <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> players during the offseason, including <a href="Miguel%20Batista">Miguel Batista</a>, <a href="Mark%20Grace">Mark Grace</a>, and <a href="Reggie%20Sanders">Reggie Sanders</a>. Most of the Diamondbacks players were above the age of thirty, and had already played on a number of teams prior to the 2001 season. In fact, the Diamondbacks <a href="starting%20lineup">starting lineup</a> for the World Series did not include a player under the age of thirty-one, making them the oldest team by player age in World Series history. With several players nearing the age of retirement, <a href="Luis%20Gonzalez%20%28outfielder%29">Luis Gonzalez</a> noted that the overall team mentality was "there's too many good guys in here to let this opportunity slip away".

Although the Diamondbacks were only one game <a href="Winning%20percentage">above .500</a> by the end of April, Gonzalez had a particularly memorable start to the season, in which he tied the MLB record with thirteen <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s during the month of April. The Diamondbacks found greater success in May and June, and at one point at a six-game lead in the NL West. During this span, the team won nine consecutive games, and Johnson tied the MLB record with twenty <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s in a nine <a href="inning">inning</a> game. The six game lead did not last long however, and by the end of July, the Diamondbacks were a half game behind the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in the West. A resurgent August pushed the team back into first place, a spot they maintained for the rest of the season. By the end of the season, several Diamondbacks players had put up exceptional <a href="Baseball%20statistics">statistics</a>: <a href="Curt%20Schilling">Curt Schilling</a> had the most wins of any pitcher in MLB that year with twenty-two, while Johnson nearly broke the single season strikeout record with 372. Johnson and Schilling also had the two lowest <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a>s (ERA) in the NL, with 2.49 and 2.98 respectively. Gonzalez ended the season with a .325 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> and fifty-seven home runs, and finished third in voting for the NL <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player Award</a>. The Diamondbacks were also one of the best defensive teams in MLB that year, second in least <a href="Error%20%28baseball%29">errors</a> committed, and tied with the <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> for the best <a href="fielding%20percentage">fielding percentage</a>.

The Diamondbacks played the <a href="2001%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the <a href="2001%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">NL Division Series</a>. Schilling threw a <a href="Shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a> in Game 1 to give the Diamondbacks an early series lead, but the Cardinals won Game 2 thanks to a two-run home run from <a href="Albert%20Pujols">Albert Pujols</a>. <a href="Craig%20Counsell">Craig Counsell</a> hit a three-run home run late in Game 3 to give the Diamondbacks a 2-1 series lead, but the Cardinals won Game 4 with strong pitching performances from <a href="Bud%20Smith">Bud Smith</a> and their <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief pitcher</a>s. The Diamondbacks clinched the series in Game 5, when <a href="Tony%20Womack">Tony Womack</a> hit a game winning <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">single</a> that scored <a href="Danny%20Bautista">Danny Bautista</a>. They then faced the <a href="2001%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a> in the <a href="2001%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NL Championship Series</a>. Johnson also threw a shutout in Game 1, while the Braves hit three home runs in Game 2 to tie the series at one game apiece. Schilling threw a <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a> in Game 3, and the Diamondbacks scored eleven runs in a Game 4 victory to take a 3-1 series lead. The Diamondbacks clinched the series in Game 5 with another strong performance from Johnson. With the win, they became the fastest expansion team to reach the World Series, in just their fourth year of play.

The Yankees finished the 2001 season in first place in the <a href="American%20League%20East">AL East</a> with a win-loss record of (a winning percentage of ), 13 1/2 games ahead of the <a href="2001%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a>. The Yankees then defeated the <a href="2001%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland Athletics</a> 3 games to 2 in the <a href="2001%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">AL Division Series</a>, and the <a href="2001%20Seattle%20Mariners%20season">Seattle Mariners</a> 4 games to 1 in the <a href="2001%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">AL Championship Series</a> to advance to their fourth consecutive World Series, and fifth in six years.

<a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> and <a href="Tino%20Martinez">Tino Martinez</a> led the Yankees offensively during the 2001 season. Jeter batted .311 with 21 home runs and 74 RBI in 150 games, while Martinez batted .280 with 34 home runs and 113 RBI in 154 games. <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a> and <a href="Mike%20Mussina">Mike Mussina</a> were the leaders of the Yankees' pitching staff. Clemens finished with a win-loss record of 20–3, an <a href="earned-run%20average">earned-run average</a> (ERA) of 3.51, and struck out 213 batters in 220.1 innings pitched. Mussina finished with a win-loss record of 17–11, an ERA of 3.15, and struck out 214 batters in 228.2 innings pitched.

Due to the postponement of MLB games as a result of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, the World Series began Saturday, October 27, 2001, the latest start date ever for a World Series until the <a href="2009%20World%20Series">2009 World Series</a>, which started on October 28. The last three games were the first major-league games (other than exhibitions) played in the month of November. This was just the fourth time that no World Series champion was decided within the traditional month of October. The previous three occurrences were in (no series), (series held in September due to World War I), and (no series due to <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">players' strike</a>). Additionally, the Series took place in New York City only seven weeks after the attacks, representing a remarkable boost in morale for the fatigued city.

The Yankees struck first in Game 1 when <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> was hit by a pitch with one out in the first and scored on <a href="Bernie%20Williams">Bernie Williams</a>'s double two batters later. However, Arizona's <a href="Curt%20Schilling">Curt Schilling</a> and two relievers held the Yankees scoreless afterward. They managed to get only two walks and two hits for the rest of the game, <a href="Scott%20Brosius">Scott Brosius</a>'s double in the second and <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a>'s single in the fourth, both with two outs.

Meanwhile, the Diamondbacks tied the game on <a href="Craig%20Counsell">Craig Counsell</a>'s one-out home run in the first off of <a href="Mike%20Mussina">Mike Mussina</a>. After a scoreless second, Mussina led off the third by hitting <a href="Tony%20Womack">Tony Womack</a> with a pitch. He moved to second on Counsell's sacrifice bunt before <a href="Luis%20Gonzalez%20%28outfielder%29">Luis Gonzalez</a>'s home run put the Diamondbacks up 3-1. A single and right fielder <a href="David%20Justice">David Justice</a>'s error put runners on second and third before <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a>'s sacrifice fly put Arizona up 4-1. After <a href="Mark%20Grace">Mark Grace</a> was intentionally walked, <a href="Damian%20Miller">Damian Miller</a>'s RBI double gave Arizona a 5-1 lead.

Next inning, Gonzalez hit a two-out double off of <a href="Randy%20Choate">Randy Choate</a>. <a href="Reggie%20Sanders">Reggie Sanders</a> was intentionally walked before Gonzalez scored on <a href="Steve%20Finley">Steve Finley</a>'s single. An error by third baseman Brosius scored Sanders, put Finley at third, and Williams at second. Both men scored on <a href="Mark%20Grace">Mark Grace</a>'s double, putting Arizona up 9-1. Though the Diamondbacks got just one more hit for the rest of the game off of <a href="Sterling%20Hitchcock">Sterling Hitchcock</a> and <a href="Mike%20Stanton%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Mike Stanton</a> (Williams's leadoff single in the seventh), they went up 1-0 in the series.

Arizona continued to take control of the Series with the strong pitching performance of <a href="Randy%20Johnson%20%28pitcher%29">Randy Johnson</a>. The Big Unit pitched a complete game shutout, allowing only four baserunners and three hits while striking out eleven Yankees. <a href="Andy%20Pettitte">Andy Pettitte</a> meanwhile nearly matched him, retiring Arizona in order in five of the seven innings he pitched. In the second, he allowed a leadoff single to <a href="Reggie%20Sanders">Reggie Sanders</a>, who scored on <a href="Danny%20Bautista">Danny Bautista</a>'s double. Bautista was the only Arizona runner stranded for the entire game. In the seventh, Pettitte hit <a href="Luis%20Gonzalez%20%28outfielder%29">Luis Gonzalez</a> with a pitch before Sanders grounded into a forceout. After Bautista singled, <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a>'s three-run home run put Arizona up 4-0. They won the game with that score and led the series two games to none as it moved to New York City.

The game was opened in New York by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, who threw the <a href="ceremonial%20first%20pitch">ceremonial first pitch</a>, a strike to Yankees backup catcher <a href="Todd%20Greene">Todd Greene</a>. Bush became the first <a href="incumbent">incumbent</a> U.S. president to throw a World Series first pitch since <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> in . He also threw the baseball from the mound where the pitcher would be set (unlike most ceremonial first pitches which are from in front of the mound) and threw it for a strike. Chants of ""<a href="U-S-A%21%20cheer">U-S-A</a>, U-S-A"" rang throughout Yankee Stadium. Yankees starter <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a> allowed only three hits and struck out nine in seven innings of work. Yankees closer <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> pitched two innings for the save.

<a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a>'s leadoff home run off of <a href="Brian%20Anderson%20%28pitcher%29">Brian Anderson</a> in the second put the Yankees up 1-0. The Diamondbacks loaded the bases in the fourth on two walks and one hit before <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a>'s sacrifice fly tied the game. <a href="Bernie%20Williams">Bernie Williams</a> hit a leadoff single in the sixth and moved to second on a wild pitch one out later before Posada walked. <a href="Mike%20Morgan%20%28baseball%29">Mike Morgan</a> relieved Anderson and struck out <a href="David%20Justice">David Justice</a> before <a href="Scott%20Brosius">Scott Brosius</a> broke the tie with an RBI single. The Yankees cut Arizona's series lead to 2-1 with the win.

Game 4 saw the Yankees send <a href="Orlando%20Hernandez">Orlando Hernandez</a> to the mound while the Diamondbacks elected to bring back <a href="Curt%20Schilling">Curt Schilling</a> on three days' rest. Both pitchers gave up solo home runs, with Schilling doing so to <a href="Shane%20Spencer">Shane Spencer</a> in the third inning and Hernandez doing so to <a href="Mark%20Grace">Mark Grace</a> in the fourth. Hernandez pitched solid innings, giving up four hits while Schilling went seven innings and gave up three.

With the game still tied entering the eighth, Arizona struck. After <a href="Mike%20Stanton%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Mike Stanton</a> recorded the first out of the inning, Luis Gonzalez singled and <a href="Erubiel%20Durazo">Erubiel Durazo</a> hit a double to bring him in. <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a> followed by grounding into a fielder's choice off of <a href="Ramiro%20Mendoza">Ramiro Mendoza</a>, which scored pinch runner <a href="Midre%20Cummings">Midre Cummings</a> and gave the team a 3-1 lead.

With his team on the verge of taking a commanding 3-1 series lead, Diamondbacks manager Bob Brenly elected to bring in closer <a href="Byung-hyun%20Kim">Byung-hyun Kim</a> in the bottom of the eighth for a two-inning save. Kim, at 22, became the first Korean-born player ever to play in the MLB World Series. Kim struck out the side in the eighth, but ran into trouble in the ninth.

<a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> led off by trying to bunt for a hit but was thrown out by Williams. <a href="Paul%20O%27Neill%20%28baseball%29">Paul O'Neill</a> then lined a single in front of Gonzalez. After <a href="Bernie%20Williams%20%28born%201968%29">Bernie Williams</a> struck out, Kim seemed to be out of trouble with <a href="Tino%20Martinez">Tino Martinez</a> coming to the plate. However, Martinez drove the first pitch he saw from Kim into the right-center field bleachers, tying the score at 3-3. The Yankees were not done, as <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a> walked and <a href="David%20Justice">David Justice</a> moved him into scoring position with a single. Kim struck Spencer out to end the threat.

When the scoreboard clock in Yankee Stadium passed midnight, World Series play in November began, with the message on the scoreboard "Welcome to November Baseball".

<a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> took the hill for the Yankees in the tenth and retired the Diamondbacks in order.
Kim went out for a third inning of work and retired <a href="Scott%20Brosius">Scott Brosius</a> and <a href="Alfonso%20Soriano">Alfonso Soriano</a>, but Jeter hit an opposite field walk-off home run on a 3–2 pitch count from Kim. This walk-off home run gave the Yankees a 4–3 victory and tied the Series at two games apiece, making Jeter the first player to hit a November home run and earning him the tongue-in-cheek nickname of "<a href="Derek%20Jeter">Mr. November</a>". 

Game 5 saw the Yankees return to <a href="Mike%20Mussina">Mike Mussina</a> for the start while the Diamondbacks sent <a href="Miguel%20Batista">Miguel Batista</a>, who had not pitched in twelve days, to the mound. Batista pitched a strong scoreless innings, striking out six. Mussina bounced back from his poor Game 1 start, recording ten strikeouts, but allowed solo home runs to <a href="Steve%20Finley">Steve Finley</a> and <a href="Rod%20Barajas">Rod Barajas</a> in the fifth.

With the Diamondbacks leading 2–0 in the ninth, Byung-hyun Kim was called upon for the save despite having thrown three innings the night before. <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a> doubled to open the inning, but Kim got <a href="Shane%20Spencer">Shane Spencer</a> to ground out and then struck out <a href="Chuck%20Knoblauch">Chuck Knoblauch</a>. Unfortunately, as had happened the previous night, Kim could not hold the lead as <a href="Scott%20Brosius">Scott Brosius</a> hit a 1–0 pitch over the left field wall, the second straight game tying home run in the bottom of the ninth for the Yankees. Kim was pulled from the game in favor of <a href="Mike%20Morgan%20%28baseball%29">Mike Morgan</a> who recorded the final out.

Morgan retired the Yankees in order in the tenth and eleventh innings, while the Diamondbacks got to <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> in the eleventh. <a href="Danny%20Bautista">Danny Bautista</a> and <a href="Erubiel%20Durazo">Erubiel Durazo</a> opened the inning with hits and <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a> advanced them into scoring position with a sacrifice bunt. Rivera then intentionally walked <a href="Steve%20Finley">Steve Finley</a> to load the bases, then got <a href="Reggie%20Sanders">Reggie Sanders</a> to line out and <a href="Mark%20Grace">Mark Grace</a> grounded out to end the inning.

Arizona went to <a href="Albie%20Lopez">Albie Lopez</a> in the twelfth, and in his first at bat he gave up a single to Knoblauch. Brosius moved him over with a bunt, and then <a href="Alfonso%20Soriano">Alfonso Soriano</a> ended the game with an RBI single to give the Yankees a 3-2 victory and a 3-2 lead in the series.

With Arizona in a must-win situation, Johnson pitched seven innings and struck out seven, giving up just two runs. The Diamondbacks struck first when <a href="Tony%20Womack">Tony Womack</a> hit a leadoff double off of Andy Pettitte and scored on Danny Bautista's single in the first. Next inning, Womack's bases-loaded single scored two and Bautista's single scored another. The Yankees loaded the bases in the third on a single and two walks, but Johnson struck out <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a> to end the inning. The Diamondbacks broke the game open with eight runs in the bottom half. Pettitte allowed a leadoff walk to <a href="Greg%20Colbrunn">Greg Colbrunn</a> and subsequent double to <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a> before being relieved by <a href="Jay%20Witasick">Jay Witasick</a>, who allowed four straight singles to <a href="Reggie%20Sanders">Reggie Sanders</a>, <a href="Jay%20Bell">Jay Bell</a>, <a href="Damian%20Miller">Damian Miller</a>, and Johnson that scored three runs. After Womack struck out, Bautista's single scored two more runs and <a href="Luis%20Gonzalez%20%28outfielder%29">Luis Gonzalez</a>'s double scored another, with Bautista being thrown out at home. Colbrunn's single and Williams's double scored a run each before Sanders struck out to end the inning. In the fourth, Bell reached first on a strike-three wild pitch before scoring on Miller's double. Johnson struck out before Womack singled to knock Witasick out of the game. With <a href="Randy%20Choate">Randy Choate</a> pitching, Yankees second baseman <a href="Alfonso%20Soriano">Alfonso Soriano</a>'s error on Bautista's ground ball allowed Miller to score and put runners on first and second before Gonzalez's single scored the Diamondbacks' final run. Choate and <a href="Mike%20Stanton%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Mike Stanton</a> kept them scoreless for the rest of the game. Pettitte was charged with six runs in two innings while Witasick was charged with nine runs in 1 1/3 innings. The Yankees scored their only runs in the sixth on back-to-back one-out singles by <a href="Shane%20Spencer">Shane Spencer</a> and <a href="Luis%20Sojo">Luis Sojo</a> with runners on second and third. The Diamondbacks hit six doubles and <a href="Danny%20Bautista">Danny Bautista</a> batted 3-for-4 with five RBIs. The team set a World Series record with 22 hits and defeated the New York Yankees in its most lopsided postseason loss in 293 postseason games. The 15–2 win evened the series at three games apiece and set up a Game 7 for the ages between Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, again pitching on three days' rest.

It was a matchup of two twenty-game winners in the Series finale that would crown a new champion. <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a> at 39 years old became the oldest Game 7 starter ever. <a href="Curt%20Schilling">Curt Schilling</a> had already started two games of the Series and pitched his 300th inning of the season on just three days' rest. The two aces matched each other inning by inning and after seven full innings, the game was tied at 1–1. The Diamondbacks scored first in the sixth inning with a <a href="Steve%20Finley">Steve Finley</a> single and a <a href="Danny%20Bautista">Danny Bautista</a> double (Bautista would be called out at third base). The Yankees responded with an RBI single from <a href="Tino%20Martinez">Tino Martinez</a>, which drove in <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a>. Brenly stayed with Schilling into the eighth, and the move backfired as <a href="Alfonso%20Soriano">Alfonso Soriano</a> hit a solo home run on an 0–2 pitch. After Schilling struck out <a href="Scott%20Brosius">Scott Brosius</a>, he gave up a single to <a href="David%20Justice">David Justice</a>, and he left the game trailing 2–1. Brenly brought in <a href="Miguel%20Batista">Miguel Batista</a> to get out <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> and then in an unconventional move, brought in the previous night's starter <a href="Randy%20Johnson">Randy Johnson</a>, who had thrown 104 pitches, in relief to keep it a one-run game. It proved to be a smart move, as Johnson retired pinch hitter <a href="Chuck%20Knoblauch">Chuck Knoblauch</a> (who batted for the left handed <a href="Paul%20O%27Neill%20%28baseball%29">Paul O'Neill</a>) on a fly out to <a href="Danny%20Bautista">Danny Bautista</a> in right field, then Johnson returned to the mound for the top of the ninth where he got <a href="Bernie%20Williams">Bernie Williams</a> to fly out to <a href="Steve%20Finley">Steve Finley</a> in center field, <a href="Tino%20Martinez">Tino Martinez</a> to ground out to <a href="Tony%20Womack">Tony Womack</a> at shortstop and he then struck out catcher <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a> to send the game to the bottom of the ninth inning.

With the Yankees ahead 2–1 in the bottom of the eighth, manager <a href="Joe%20Torre">Joe Torre</a> turned the game over to his ace closer <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> for a two-inning save. Rivera struck out the side in the eighth, including Arizona's <a href="Luis%20Gonzalez%20%28outfielder%29">Luis Gonzalez</a>, <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a>, and <a href="Danny%20Bautista">Danny Bautista</a>, which lowered his ERA in the postseason to a major league-best of 0.70. Although he was effective in the eighth, this game would end in the third ninth-inning comeback of the Series.

<a href="Mark%20Grace">Mark Grace</a> led off the inning with a single to center on a 1–0 pitch. Rivera's errant throw to second base on a bunt attempt by <a href="Damian%20Miller">Damian Miller</a> on an 0–1 pitch put runners on first and second. <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> tried to reach for the ball, but got tangled in the legs of pinch-runner <a href="David%20Dellucci">David Dellucci</a>, who was sliding in an attempt to break up the double play. During the next at bat, Rivera appeared to regain control when he fielded <a href="Jay%20Bell">Jay Bell</a>'s bunt and threw out Dellucci at third base, but third baseman <a href="Scott%20Brosius">Scott Brosius</a> decided to hold onto the baseball instead of throwing to first to complete the <a href="double%20play">double play</a>. <a href="Midre%20Cummings">Midre Cummings</a> was sent in to pinch-run for <a href="Damian%20Miller">Damian Miller</a>. With Cummings at second and Bell at first, the next batter, <a href="Tony%20Womack">Tony Womack</a>, hit a double down the right-field line on a 2–2 pitch that tied the game and earned Rivera a blown save. Bell advanced to third and the Yankees pulled the infield and outfield in as the potential winning run stood at third with fewer than two outs. After Rivera hit <a href="Craig%20Counsell">Craig Counsell</a> with an 0–1 pitch, the bases were loaded. On an 0–1 pitch, <a href="Luis%20Gonzalez%20%28outfielder%29">Luis Gonzalez</a> lofted a soft single over the drawn-in <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> that barely reached the outfield grass, plating <a href="Jay%20Bell">Jay Bell</a> with the winning run. This ended New York's bid for a fourth consecutive title and brought Arizona its first championship within its fourth year of existence, making the Diamondbacks the fastest expansion team to win a World Series, as well as the first major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona.

In 2009, Game 7 was chosen by "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" as the <a href="List%20of%202009%20all-decade%20Sports%20Illustrated%20awards%20and%20honors%23Major%20League%20Baseball">Best Postseason Game of the Decade</a> (2000–2009).

2001 World Series (4–3): <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> (N.L.) over <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> (A.L.)
For the second consecutive year, <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20Fox">Fox</a> carried the World Series over its network with its top broadcast team, <a href="Joe%20Buck">Joe Buck</a> and <a href="Tim%20McCarver">Tim McCarver</a> (himself a <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20broadcasters">Yankees broadcaster</a>). This was the first year of Fox's exclusive rights to the World Series (in the previous contract, Fox only broadcast the World Series in even numbered years while <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC">NBC</a> broadcast it in odd numbered years), which it has held ever since (this particular contract also had given Fox exclusive rights to the entire baseball postseason, which aired over its family of networks; the contract was modified following <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a>'s purchase of <a href="ABC%20Family">Fox Family Channel</a> shortly after the World Series ended, as ESPN regained their postseason rights following a year of postseason games on ABC Family, Fox Family's successor). <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20ESPN%20Radio">ESPN Radio</a> provided national radio coverage for the fourth consecutive year, with <a href="Jon%20Miller">Jon Miller</a> and <a href="Joe%20Morgan">Joe Morgan</a> calling the action.

Locally, the Series was broadcast by <a href="KTAR%20%28AM%29">KTAR-AM</a> in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> with <a href="Thom%20Brennaman">Thom Brennaman</a>, <a href="Greg%20Schulte">Greg Schulte</a>, <a href="Rod%20Allen">Rod Allen</a> and <a href="Jim%20Traber">Jim Traber</a>, and by <a href="WABC%20%28AM%29">WABC-AM</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> with <a href="John%20Sterling%20%28sportscaster%29">John Sterling</a> and <a href="Michael%20Kay%20%28sports%20broadcaster%29">Michael Kay</a>. This would be Sterling and Kay's last World Series working together, and Game 7 would be the last Yankee broadcast on WABC. Kay moved to television and the new <a href="YES%20Network">YES Network</a> the following season and <a href="WCBS%20%28AM%29">WCBS</a> picked up radio rights to the Yankees. It was Kay who announced <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a>'s game-winning home run in Game 4 of the series and subsequently anointed him as "Mr. November".

After the Yankees lost the World Series, several players moved onto other teams or retired, the most notable changes being the signing of <a href="Jason%20Giambi">Jason Giambi</a> to replace Martinez, and the retirements of Brosius and O'Neill. Martinez would later finish his career with the Yankees in 2005 after spending the previous three years in St. Louis and Tampa Bay.

After winning the NL West again in 2002 the <a href="2002%20Arizona%20Diamondbacks%20season">Diamondbacks</a> were swept 3–0 by <a href="2002%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis</a> in the <a href="2002%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">NLDS</a>. From here they declined, losing 111 games in 2004 as Bob Brenly was fired during that season. Arizona would not win another NL West title until 2007. Schilling was traded to the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> after the 2003 season and in 2004 helped lead them to their first world championship since 1918. He helped them win another championship in 2007 and retired after four years with Boston, missing the entire 2008 season with a shoulder injury. Johnson was traded to the Yankees after the 2004 season, a season that saw him <a href="Randy%20Johnson%27s%20perfect%20game">throw a perfect game</a> against the <a href="2004%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a>, though he would be traded back to the Diamondbacks two years later and finish his career with the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a> in 2009. The last player from the 2001 Diamondbacks roster, <a href="Lyle%20Overbay">Lyle Overbay</a>, retired following the 2014 season with the <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> while the last player from the 2001 Yankees, <a href="Randy%20Choate">Randy Choate</a>, retired on February 16, 2017.

From 2002 through 2007, the Yankees' misfortune in the postseason continued, with the team losing the <a href="2002%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> to the <a href="2002%20Anaheim%20Angels%20season">Anaheim Angels</a> in 2002, the <a href="2003%20World%20Series">World Series</a> to the <a href="2003%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">Florida Marlins</a> in 2003, the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a> to the <a href="2004%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a> (in the process becoming the first ever team in postseason history to blow a 3-0 series lead) in 2004, the <a href="2005%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> again to the <a href="2005%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Angels</a> in 2005, the <a href="2006%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> to <a href="2006%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Detroit</a> in 2006, and the <a href="2007%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> to <a href="2007%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland</a> in 2007. <a href="Joe%20Torre">Joe Torre</a>'s contract was allowed to expire and he was replaced by <a href="Joe%20Girardi">Joe Girardi</a> in 2008, a season in which the Yankees would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993. The Yankees won their 27th World Series in 2009, defeating the defending champion <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> in six games.

<a href="Buster%20Olney">Buster Olney</a>, who covered the Yankees for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" before joining ESPN, would write a book titled "<a href="The%20Last%20Night%20of%20the%20Yankee%20Dynasty">The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty</a>". The book is a play by play account of Game 7 in addition to stories about key players, executives, and moments from the 1996–2001 dynasty. In a 2005 reprinting, Olney included a new epilogue covering the aftermath of the 2001 World Series up to the Boston Red Sox epic comeback from down 3–0 in the 2004 ALCS.

, this is the state of <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>'s only world championship among the <a href="major%20professional%20sports%20teams%20of%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada">four major professional sports</a>.

On October 11, 2005, A&E Home Video released the "New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001)" DVD set. Game 4 of the 2001 World Series is included in the set. On April 29, 2008, "The Arizona Diamondbacks 2001 World Series" DVD set was released. All seven games are included on this set.

1903 World Series

The 1903 World Series was the first modern <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> to be played in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>. It matched the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Americans</a> of the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> against the <a href="Pittsburg%20Pirates">Pittsburg Pirates</a> of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> in a best-of-nine series, with Boston prevailing five games to three, winning the last four.

Pittsburg pitcher <a href="Sam%20Leever">Sam Leever</a> injured his shoulder while trap-shooting, so his teammate <a href="Deacon%20Phillippe">Deacon Phillippe</a> pitched five complete games. Phillippe won three of his games, but it was not enough to overcome the club from the new American League. Boston pitchers <a href="Bill%20Dinneen">Bill Dinneen</a> and <a href="Cy%20Young">Cy Young</a> led Boston to victory. In Game 1, Phillippe struck out ten Boston batters. The next day, Dinneen bettered that mark, striking out eleven Pittsburg batters in Game 2.

<a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>, bothered by injuries, batted only 6 for 27 (.222) in the Series and committed six errors. The shortstop was deeply distraught by his performance. The following spring, Wagner (who in 1903 led the league in batting average) refused to send his portrait to a "Hall of Fame" for batting champions. "I was too bum last year", he wrote. "I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburg Series. What does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch? I would be ashamed to have my picture up now."

Due to overflow crowds at the <a href="Exposition%20Park%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Exposition Park</a> games in <a href="Allegheny%20City">Allegheny City</a>, if a batted ball rolled under a rope in the outfield that held spectators back, a "ground-rule triple" would be scored. Seventeen ground-rule triples were hit in the four games played at the stadium.

In the series, Boston came back from a three games to one deficit, winning the final four games to capture the title. Such a large comeback would not happen again until the Pirates came back to defeat the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> in the <a href="1925%20World%20Series">1925 World Series</a>, and has happened only eleven times in baseball history. (The Pirates themselves repeated this feat in against the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>.) Much was made of the influence of Boston's "<a href="Royal%20Rooters">Royal Rooters</a>", who traveled to Exposition Park and sang their theme song "<a href="Tessie">Tessie</a>" to distract the opposing players (especially Wagner). Boston wound up winning three out of four games in Allegheny City.

Pirates owner <a href="Barney%20Dreyfuss">Barney Dreyfuss</a> added his share of the gate receipts to the players' share, so the losing team's players actually finished with a larger individual share than the winning team's.

The Series brought the new American League prestige and proved its best could beat the best of the National League, thus strengthening the demand for future World Series competitions.

In 1901, <a href="Ban%20Johnson">Ban Johnson</a>, president of the <a href="Western%20League%20%28original%29">Western League</a>, a minor league organization, formed the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> to take advantage of the National League's 1900 contraction from twelve teams to eight. Johnson and fellow owners raided the National League and signed away many star players, including <a href="Cy%20Young">Cy Young</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Collins">Jimmy Collins</a>. Johnson had a list of 46 National Leaguers he targeted for the American League; by 1902, all but one had made the jump. The constant raiding, however, scotched the idea of a championship between the two leagues. Pirates owner <a href="Barney%20Dreyfuss">Barney Dreyfuss</a>, whose team ran away with the 1902 National League pennant, was open to a post-season contest and even said he would allow the American League champion to stock its roster with all-stars. However, Johnson had spoken of putting a team in <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburg</a> and even attempted to raid the Pirates' roster in August 1902, which soured Dreyfuss. At the end of the season, however, the Pirates played a group of American League All-Stars in a four-game exhibition series, winning two games to one, with one tie.

The leagues finally called a truce in the winter of 1902–03 and formed the <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball%20%28MLB%29">National Commission</a> to preside over organized baseball. The following season, the Boston Americans and Pittsburg Pirates had secured their respective championship pennants by September. That August, Dreyfuss challenged the American League to an eleven-game championship series. Encouraged by Johnson and National League President <a href="Harry%20Pulliam">Harry Pulliam</a>, Americans owner Henry J. Killilea met with Dreyfuss in Pittsburg in September and instead agreed to a best-of-nine championship, with the first three games played in Boston, the next four in Allegheny City, and the remaining two (if necessary) in Boston.

One significant point about this agreement was that it was an arrangement primarily between the two clubs rather than a formal arrangement between the leagues. In short, it was a voluntary event, a fact which would result in no Series at all for . The formal establishment of the Series as a compulsory event started in .

The Pirates won their third straight pennant in 1903 thanks to a powerful line-up that included legendary shortstop <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>, who hit .355 and drove in 101 runs, player-manager <a href="Fred%20Clarke">Fred Clarke</a>, who hit .351, and <a href="Ginger%20Beaumont">Ginger Beaumont</a>, who hit .341 and led the league in hits and runs. The Pirates' pitching was weaker than it had been in previous years but boasted 24-game winner <a href="Deacon%20Phillippe">Deacon Phillippe</a> and 25-game winner <a href="Sam%20Leever">Sam Leever</a>.

The Americans had a strong pitching staff, led by <a href="Cy%20Young">Cy Young</a>, who went 28–9 in 1903 and became the all-time wins leader that year. <a href="Bill%20Dinneen">Bill Dinneen</a> and <a href="Long%20Tom%20Hughes">Long Tom Hughes</a>, right-handers like Young, had won 21 games and 20 games each. The Boston outfield, featuring <a href="Chick%20Stahl">Chick Stahl</a> (.274), <a href="Buck%20Freeman">Buck Freeman</a> (.287, 104 <a href="RBI">RBI</a>s) and <a href="Patsy%20Dougherty">Patsy Dougherty</a> (.331, 101 <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a> scored) was considered excellent.
Although the Pirates had dominated their league for the previous three years, they went into the series riddled with injuries and plagued by bizarre misfortunes. <a href="Otto%20Krueger%20%28baseball%29">Otto Krueger</a>, the team's only <a href="utility%20player">utility player</a>, was beaned on September 19 and never fully played in the series. 16-game winner <a href="Ed%20Doheny">Ed Doheny</a> left the team three days later, exhibiting signs of <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a>; he was committed to an <a href="insane%20asylum">insane asylum</a> the following month. Leever had been battling an injury to his pitching arm (which he made worse by entering a <a href="trapshooting">trapshooting</a> competition). Worst of all, Wagner, who had a sore thumb throughout the season, injured his right leg in September and was never 100 percent for the post-season.

Some sources say Boston were heavy underdogs. Boston <a href="bookies">bookies</a> actually gave even odds to the teams (and only because Dreyfuss and other "sports" were alleged to have bet on Pittsburg to bring down the odds). The teams were generally thought to be evenly matched, with the Americans credited with stronger pitching and the Pirates with superior offense and fielding. The outcome, many believed, hinged on Wagner's health. "If Wagner does not play, bet your money at two to one on Boston", said the "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>", "but if he does play, place your money at two to one on Pittsburg."

Thursday, October 1, 1903, at <a href="Huntington%20Avenue%20Grounds">Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds</a> in <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>

The Pirates started Game 1 strong, scoring six runs in the first four innings. They extended their lead to 7–0 on a solo home run by <a href="Jimmy%20Sebring">Jimmy Sebring</a> in the seventh, the first home run in World Series history. Boston tried to mount a comeback in the last three innings, but it was too little too late, and they ended up losing by a score of 7–3 in the first ever World Series game. Both Phillippe and Young threw complete games, with Phillippe striking out ten and Young fanning five, but Young also gave up twice as many hits and allowed three earned runs to Phillippe's two.

Friday, October 2, 1903, at <a href="Huntington%20Avenue%20Grounds">Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds</a> in <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>

After starting out strong in Game 1, the Pirates simply shut down offensively, eking out a mere three hits, all singles. Pittsburg starter Sam Leever went 1 inning and gave up three hits and two runs, before his ailing arm forced him to leave in favor of <a href="Bucky%20Veil">Bucky Veil</a>, who finished the game. Bill Dinneen struck out eleven and pitched a complete game for the Americans, while Patsy Dougherty hit home runs in the first and sixth innings for two of the Boston's three runs. The Americans' <a href="Patsy%20Dougherty">Patsy Dougherty</a> led off the Boston scoring with an <a href="inside-the-park%20home%20run">inside-the-park home run</a>, the first time a leadoff batter did just that until <a href="Alcides%20Escobar">Alcides Escobar</a> of the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> duplicated the feat in the <a href="2015%20World%20Series">2015 World Series</a>, 112 years later. Dougherty's second home run was the first in World Series history to actually sail over the fence, an incredibly rare feat at the time.

Saturday, October 3, 1903, at <a href="Huntington%20Avenue%20Grounds">Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds</a> in <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>

Phillippe, pitching after only a single day of rest, started Game 3 for the Pirates and didn't let them down, hurling his second complete game victory of the Series to put Pittsburg up two games to one.

Tuesday, October 6, 1903, at <a href="Exposition%20Park%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Exposition Park (III)</a> in <a href="Allegheny%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny, Pennsylvania</a>

After two days of rest, Phillippe was ready to pitch a second straight game. He threw his third complete game victory of the series against Bill Dinneen, who was making his second start of the series. But Phillippe's second straight win was almost not to be, as the Americans, down 5–1 in the top of the ninth, rallied to narrow the deficit to one run. The comeback attempt failed, as Phillippe managed to put an end to it and give the Pirates a commanding 3–1 Series lead.

Wednesday, October 7, 1903, at <a href="Exposition%20Park%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Exposition Park (III)</a> in <a href="Allegheny%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny, Pennsylvania</a>

Game 5 was a pitcher's duel for the first five innings, with Boston's Cy Young and Pittsburg's <a href="Brickyard%20Kennedy">Brickyard Kennedy</a> giving up no runs. That changed in the top of the sixth, however, when the Americans scored a then-record six runs before being retired. Young, on the other hand, managed to keep his shutout intact before finally giving up a pair of runs in the bottom of the eighth. He went the distance and struck out four for his first World Series win.

Thursday, October 8, 1903, at <a href="Exposition%20Park%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Exposition Park (III)</a> in <a href="Allegheny%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny, Pennsylvania</a>

Game 6 was a rematch between the starters of Game 2, Boston's Dinneen and Pittsburg's Leever. Leever pitched a complete game this time but so did Dinneen, who outmatched him to earn his second complete game victory of the series. After losing three of the first four games of the World Series, the underdog Americans had tied the series at three games apiece.

Saturday, October 10, 1903, at <a href="Exposition%20Park%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Exposition Park (III)</a> in <a href="Allegheny%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny, Pennsylvania</a>

The fourth and final game in Allegheny saw Phillippe start his fourth game of the Series for the Pirates. This time, however, he wouldn't fare as well as he did in his first three starts. Cy Young, in his third start of the Series, held the Pirates to three runs and put the Americans ahead for the first time as the Series moved back to Boston.

Tuesday, October 13, 1903, at <a href="Huntington%20Avenue%20Grounds">Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds</a> in <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>

The final game of this inaugural World Series started out as an intense pitcher's duel, scoreless until the bottom of the fourth when <a href="Hobe%20Ferris">Hobe Ferris</a> hit a two-run single. Phillippe started his fifth and final game of the series and Dinneen his fourth. As he did in Game 2, Dinneen threw a complete game shutout, striking out seven and leading his Americans to victory, while Phillippe pitched respectably but just couldn't match Dinneen because his arm had been worn out with five starts in the eight games, giving up three runs to give the first 20th-century World Championship to the Boston Americans, Honus Wagner striking out to end the Series.

Bluetongue disease

Bluetongue disease is a non-<a href="infectious%20disease">contagious</a>, <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">insect-borne</a>, <a href="Virus">viral</a> disease of <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s, mainly <a href="Domestic%20sheep">sheep</a> and less frequently cattle, <a href="goat">goat</a>s, <a href="Bovinae">buffalo</a>, <a href="deer">deer</a>, <a href="dromedary">dromedaries</a>, and <a href="antelope">antelope</a>. It is caused by the Bluetongue virus (BTV). The virus is transmitted by the <a href="midge">midge</a> "<a href="Culicoides%20imicola">Culicoides imicola</a>", "<a href="Culicoides%20variipennis">Culicoides variipennis</a>", and other <a href="Culicoides">culicoid</a>s.

In sheep, BTV causes an acute disease with high morbidity and mortality. BTV also infects goats, cattle and other domestic animals as well as wild ruminants (for example, blesbuck, white-tailed deer, elk, and pronghorn antelope).

Major <a href="sign%20%28medicine%29">signs</a> are high fever, excessive <a href="saliva">saliva</a>tion, <a href="edema">swelling</a> of the face and tongue and <a href="cyanosis">cyanosis</a> of the tongue. Swelling of the lips and tongue gives the tongue its typical blue appearance, though this sign is confined to a minority of the animals. Nasal signs may be prominent, with nasal discharge and <a href="stertorous">stertorous</a> respiration.

Some animals also develop foot lesions, beginning with coronitis, with consequent lameness. In sheep, this can lead to knee-walking. In cattle, constant changing of position of the feet gives bluetongue the nickname The Dancing Disease. Torsion of the neck (<a href="opisthotonos">opisthotonos</a> or <a href="torticollis">torticollis</a>) is observed in severely affected animals.

Not all animals develop signs, but all those that do lose condition rapidly, and the sickest die within a week. For affected animals which do not die, recovery is very slow, lasting several months.

The <a href="incubation%20period">incubation period</a> is 5–20 days, and all signs usually develop within a month. The <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> is normally low, but it is high in susceptible <a href="breed">breed</a>s of sheep. In Africa, local breeds of sheep may have no mortality, but in imported breeds it may be up to 90 percent.

In cattle, goats and wild ruminants <a href="infection">infection</a> is usually <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> despite high virus levels in blood. <a href="Red%20deer">Red deer</a> are an exception, and in them the disease may be as acute as in sheep.

Bluetongue is caused by the <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic <a href="virus%20%28biology%29">virus</a>, Bluetongue virus (BTV), of the genus "<a href="Orbivirus">Orbivirus</a>", of the <a href="Reoviridae">Reoviridae</a> family. Twenty-six serotypes are now recognised for this virus.

The virus particle consists of ten strands of double-stranded RNA surrounded by two protein shells. Unlike other <a href="arboviruses">arboviruses</a>, BTV lacks a lipid envelope. The particle has a diameter of 86 nm. The structure of the 70 nm core was determined in 1998 and was at the time the largest atomic structure to be solved.

The two outer capsid proteins, VP2 and VP5, mediate attachment and penetration of BTV into the target cell. The virus makes initial contact with the cell with VP2, triggering <a href="receptor-mediated%20endocytosis">receptor-mediated endocytosis</a> of the virus. The low pH within the <a href="endosome">endosome</a> then triggers BTV's membrane penetration protein VP5 to undergo a conformational change that disrupts the endosomal membrane. Uncoating yields a transcriptionally active 470S core particle which is composed of two major proteins VP7 and VP3, and the three minor proteins VP1, VP4 and VP6 in addition to the dsRNA genome. There is no evidence that any trace of the outer capsid remains associated with these cores, as has been described for reovirus. The cores may be further uncoated to form 390S subcore particles that lack VP7, also in contrast to reovirus. Subviral particles are probably akin to cores derived "in vitro" from virions by physical or proteolytic treatments that remove the outer capsid and causes activation of the BTV transcriptase. In addition to the seven structural proteins, three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2, NS3 (and a related NS3A) are synthesised in BTV-infected cells. Of these, NS3/NS3A is involved in the egress of the progeny virus. The two remaining non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2, are produced at high levels in the cytoplasm and are believed to be involved in virus replication, assembly and morphogenesis.

Bluetongue has been observed in Australia, the USA, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe. An outline of the transmission cycle of BTV is illustrated in article <a href="Parasitic%20flies%20of%20domestic%20animals">Parasitic flies of domestic animals</a>.

Its occurrence is seasonal in the affected <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> countries, subsiding when temperatures drop and hard frosts kill the adult midge <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vectors</a>. 
Viral survival and vector longevity is seen during milder winters. 
A significant contribution to the northward spread of Bluetongue disease has been the ability of "<a href="Culicoides%20obsoletus">Culicoides obsoletus</a>" and "C.pulicaris" to acquire and transmit the pathogen, both of which are spread widely throughout Europe. This is in contrast to the original "C.imicola" vector which is limited to North Africa and the Mediterranean. The relatively recent novel vector has facilitated a far more rapid spread than the simple expansion of habitats North through global warming.

In August 2006, cases of bluetongue were found in the Netherlands, then Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg. 
In 2007, the first case of bluetongue in the Czech Republic was detected in one bull near <a href="Cheb">Cheb</a> at the Czech-German border. 
In September 2007, the UK reported its first ever suspected case of the disease, in a Highland cow on a rare breeds farm near <a href="Ipswich%2C%20Suffolk">Ipswich, Suffolk</a>. 
Since then the virus has spread from cattle to sheep in Britain. 
By October 2007 bluetongue had become a serious threat in Scandinavia and Switzerland 
and the first outbreak in Denmark was reported. In autumn 2008, several cases were reported in the southern Swedish provinces of Småland, Halland, and Skåne,
as well as in areas of the Netherlands bordering Germany, prompting veterinary authorities in Germany to intensify controls.
Norway saw its first finding in February 2009, when cows at two farms in <a href="Vest-Agder">Vest-Agder</a> in the south of Norway showed an immune response to bluetongue. Norway have since been declared free of the disease in 2011.

Although the disease is not a threat to humans the most vulnerable common domestic ruminants in the UK are cattle, goats and, especially, sheep.

A puzzling aspect of BTV is its survival between midge seasons in temperate regions. Adult "Culicoides" are killed by cold winter temperatures, and BTV infections typically do not last for more than 60 days, which is not long enough for BTV to last until the next spring. It is believed that the virus somehow survives in overwintering midges or animals. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed. A few adult "Culicoides" midges infected with BTV may survive the mild winters of the temperate zone. Some midges may even move indoors to avoid the cold temperature of the winter. Additionally, BTV could cause a chronic or latent infection in some animals, providing another means for BTV to survive the winter. BTV can also be transmitted from mother to fetus. The outcome is abortion or stillbirth if fetal infection occurs early in gestation and survival if infection occurs late. However infection at an intermediate stage, before the fetal immune system is fully developed, may result in a chronic infection that lingers until the first months after birth of the lamb. Midges will then spread the pathogen from the calves to other animals, starting a new season of infection.

Prevention is effected via <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a>, <a href="inoculation">inoculation</a> with live modified virus <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a> and control of the midge <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a>, including inspection of aircraft.

However, simple husbandry changes and practical midge control measures may help break the livestock infection cycle. Housing livestock during times of maximum midge activity (from dusk to dawn) may lead to significantly reduced biting rates. Similarly, protecting livestock shelters with fine mesh netting or coarser material impregnated with insecticide will reduce contact with the midges. The "<a href="Culicoides">Culicoides</a>" midges that carry the virus usually breed on animal dung and moist soils, either bare or covered in short grass. Identifying breeding grounds and breaking the breeding cycle will significantly reduce the local midge population. Turning off taps, mending leaks and filling in or draining damp areas will also help dry up breeding sites. Control by trapping midges and removing their breeding grounds may reduce vector numbers. Dung heaps or slurry pits should be covered or removed, and their perimeters (where most larvae are found) regularly scraped.

Outbreaks in southern Europe have been caused by serotypes 2 and 4, and vaccines are available against these serotypes (<a href="ATCvet">ATCvet</a> codes: for sheep, for cattle). However, the disease found in northern Europe (including the UK) in 2006 and 2007 has been caused by serotype 8. Vaccine companies Fort Dodge Animal Health (<a href="Wyeth">Wyeth</a>), Merial and Intervet were developing vaccines against serotype 8 (Fort Dodge Animal Health has serotype 4 for sheep, serotype 1 for sheep and cattle and serotype 8 for sheep and cattle) and the associated production facilities. A vaccine for this is now available in the UK, produced by Intervet. Fort Dodge Animal Health has their vaccines available for multiple European Countries (vaccination will start in 2008 in Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain and Italy). However, immunization with any of the available vaccines preclude later serological monitoring of affected cattle populations, a problem which could be resolved using next-generation subunit vaccines currently in development.

In January 2015, Indian researchers launched its vaccine. Named 'Raksha Blu', it will protect the animals against five strains of the ‘bluetongue’ virus prevalent in the country.

Although bluetongue disease was already recognized in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> in the early 19th century, a comprehensive description of the disease was not published until the first decade of the 20th century. In 1906 <a href="Arnold%20Theiler">Arnold Theiler</a> showed that bluetongue was caused by a filterable agent. He also created the first bluetongue vaccine, which was developed from an attenuated BTV strain. For many decades bluetongue was thought to be confined to Africa. The first confirmed outbreak outside of Africa occurred in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> in 1943.

<a href="African%20horse%20sickness">African horse sickness</a> is related to Bluetongue and is spread by the same midges ("Culicoides" species). It can kill the horses it infects and mortality may go as high as 90% of the infected horses during an epidemic.

The <a href="Epizootic%20Hemorrhagic%20Disease">Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease</a> (EHD) virus is closely related and crossreacts with Bluetongue virus on many blood tests.

Bruce Perens

Bruce Perens (born around 1958) is an American <a href="Programmer">computer programmer</a> and advocate in the <a href="free%20software%20movement">free software movement</a>. He created <a href="The%20Open%20Source%20Definition">The Open Source Definition</a> and published the first formal announcement and manifesto of <a href="open%20source">open source</a>. He co-founded the <a href="Open%20Source%20Initiative">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) with <a href="Eric%20S.%20Raymond">Eric S. Raymond</a>.

In 2005, Perens represented Open Source at the <a href="World%20Summit%20on%20the%20Information%20Society">United Nations World Summit on the Information Society</a>, at the invitation of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a>. He has appeared before national legislatures and is often quoted in the press, advocating for open source and the reform of national and international technology policy.

Perens is also an <a href="Amateur%20radio">amateur radio operator</a>, with <a href="call%20sign">call sign</a> K6BP. He promotes open radio communications standards and <a href="open-source%20hardware">open-source hardware</a>.

Perens is currently CEO of two companies: Algoram is a start-up which is creating a 50-1000 MHz software-defined radio transceiver. Legal Engineering is a legal-technical consultancy which specializes in resolving copyright infringement in relation to open source software.

Perens grew up in <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. He was born with <a href="cerebral%20palsy">cerebral palsy</a>, which caused him to have slurred speech as a child, a condition that led to a misdiagnosis of him as <a href="Developmental%20disability">developmentally disabled</a> in school and led the school to fail to teach him to read. He developed an interest in technology at an early age: besides his interest in amateur radio, he ran a <a href="pirate%20radio">pirate radio</a> station in the town of <a href="Lido%20Beach%2C%20New%20York">Lido Beach</a> and briefly engaged in phone <a href="phreaking">phreaking</a>.

Perens worked for seven years at the <a href="New%20York%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20Computer%20Graphics%20Lab">New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab</a>. After that, he worked at <a href="Pixar">Pixar</a> for 12 years, from 1987 to 1999. He is credited as a studio tools engineer on the Pixar films "<a href="A%20Bug%27s%20Life">A Bug's Life</a>" (1998) and "<a href="Toy%20Story%202">Toy Story 2</a>" (1999).

Perens founded No-Code International in 1998 with the goal of ending the Morse Code test then required for an <a href="amateur%20radio">amateur radio</a> license. His rationale was that amateur radio should be a tool for young people to learn advanced technology and networking, rather than something that preserved antiquity and required new hams to master outmoded technology before they were allowed on the air.

To achieve the end of Morse Code requirements, it was necessary for the International Telecommunications Union, a department of the United Nations, to strike section S25.5, requiring Morse Code proficiency of radio amateurs in all nations, from the International Telecommunications Treaty. Only then would it be possible for individual nations to strike all Morse Code requirements from their laws regarding radio amateur licensing.

Perens lobbied intensively on the internet, at amateur radio events in the United States, and during visits to other nations. One of his visits was to Iceland, where he had half of that nation's radio amateurs in the room, and their vote in the International Amateur Radio Union was equivalent to that of the entire United States. The No-Code effort was successful. With the possible exception of Russia, all nations have struck their Morse Code requirements.

Bruce's participation is verified at Eham.net http://www.eham.net/articles/12727

In 1995, Perens created <a href="BusyBox">BusyBox</a>, a package of <a href="Unix">UNIX</a>-style utilities for operating systems including <a href="Linux">Linux</a> and <a href="FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>. He stopped working on it in 1996, after which it was taken over by other developers.

Starting in 2007, several lawsuits were filed for infringement of BusyBox copyright and licensing. These lawsuits were filed by the <a href="Software%20Freedom%20Law%20Center">Software Freedom Law Center</a> (SFLC), and some of the later managing developers of BusyBox.

In 2009, Bruce Perens released a statement about the lawsuits and <a href="plaintiff">those filing them</a>. In it, he claims that he maintains a significant or even majority ownership of the software in the litigation, but was not contacted nor represented by the plaintiffs; and that some of the plaintiffs had themselves modified BusyBox and its distribution package in such a way as to violate applicable licensing terms and copyright owned by Perens and additional BusyBox developers. Perens supports enforcement of the GPL license used on Busybox. Because he was denied participation in the Busybox cases on the side of the prosecution, Perens started a consulting business to assist the defendants in coming into compliance with the GPL and arriving at an amicable settlement with the Software Freedom Law Center.

From April 1996 to December 1997, while still working at Pixar, Perens served as <a href="Debian%23Organization">Debian Project Leader</a>, the person who coordinates development of the <a href="Debian">Debian</a> open source operating system. He replaced <a href="Ian%20Murdock">Ian Murdock</a>, the creator of Debian, who had been the first project leader.

In 1997, Perens was a co-founder of <a href="Software%20in%20the%20Public%20Interest">Software in the Public Interest</a> (SPI), a <a href="nonprofit%20organization">nonprofit organization</a> intended to serve as an umbrella organization to aid open-source software and hardware projects. It was originally created to allow the <a href="Debian">Debian Project</a> to accept donations.

In 1997, Perens carbon-copied an email conversation between Donnie Barnes of Red Hat and Ean Schuessler, who was then working on Debian. Schuessler bemoaned that Red Hat had never stated its social contract with the Open Source community. Perens took this as inspiration to create a formal social contract for Debian. In a blog posting, Perens claims not to have made use of the Three Freedoms (later the Four Freedoms) published by the Free Software Foundation in composing his document. Perens proposed a draft of the Debian Social Contract to the Debian developers on the debian-private mailing list early in June 1997. Debian developers contributed discussion and changes for the rest of the month while Perens edited, and the completed document was then announced as Debian project policy. Part of the Debian Social Contract was the <a href="Debian%20Free%20Software%20Guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>, a set of 10 guidelines for determining whether a set of software can be described as "free software", and thus whether it could be included in Debian.

On February 3, 1998, a group of people (not including Perens) met at VA Linux Systems to discuss the promotion of Free Software to business in pragmatic terms, rather than the moral terms preferred by Richard Stallman. Christine Petersen of the nanotechnology organization Foresight Institute, who was present because Foresight took an early interest in Free Software, suggested the term "Open Source". The next day, Eric S. Raymond recruited Perens to work with him on the formation of Open Source. Perens modified the Debian Free Software Guidelines into the Open Source Definition by removing Debian references and replacing them with "Open Source".

The original announcement of <a href="The%20Open%20Source%20Definition">The Open Source Definition</a> was made on February 9, 1998 on <a href="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> and elsewhere; the definition was given in <a href="Linux%20Gazette">Linux Gazette</a> on February 10, 1998.

Concurrently, Perens and Raymond established the <a href="Open%20Source%20Initiative">Open Source Initiative</a>, an organization intended to promote open source software.

Perens left OSI in 1999, a year after co-founding it. In February 1999 in an email to the Debian developers mailing list he explained his decision and stated that, though "most hackers know that Free Software and Open Source are just two words for the same thing", the success of "open source" as a marketing term had "de-emphasized the importance of the freedoms involved in Free Software"; he added, "It's time for us to fix that." He stated his regret that OSI co-founder Eric Raymond "seems to be losing his free software focus." But in the following 2000s he spoke about Open source again.

In 1999, Perens left Pixar and became the president of Linux Capital Group, a business incubator and <a href="venture%20capital">venture capital</a> firm focusing on Linux-based businesses. Their major investment was in <a href="Progeny%20Linux%20Systems">Progeny Linux Systems</a>, a company headed by Debian founder Ian Murdock. In 2000, as a result of the economic downturn, Perens shut down Linux Capital Group. (Progeny Linux Systems would end operations in 2007.)

From December 2000 to September 2002, Perens served as "Senior Global Strategist for Linux and Open Source" at <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>, internally evangelizing for the use of Linux and other open-source software. He was fired as a result of his anti-<a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> statements, which especially became an issue after HP acquired <a href="Compaq">Compaq</a>, a major manufacturer of <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>-based PCs, in 2002.

In 2001, Perens founded, and became the first project leader, of the <a href="Linux%20Standard%20Base">Linux Standard Base</a> project, a joint project by several Linux distributions under the organizational structure of the <a href="Linux%20Foundation">Linux Foundation</a> to standardize the Linux software system structure.

In 2003 Perens created <a href="UserLinux">UserLinux</a>, a Debian-based distribution whose stated goal was, "Provide businesses with freely available, high quality Linux operating systems accompanied by certifications, service, and support options designed to encourage productivity and security while reducing overall costs." UserLinux was eventually overtaken in popularity by <a href="Ubuntu%20%28operating%20system%29">Ubuntu</a>, another Debian-based distribution, which was started in 2004, and UserLinux became unmaintained in 2006.

Perens was an employee of SourceLabs, a <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>-based open source software and services company, from June 2005 until December 2007. He produced a video commercial, "Impending Security Breach", for SourceLabs in 2007. (SourceLabs went out of business in 2009.)

Between 1981 and 1986, Perens was on the staff of the <a href="New%20York%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20Computer%20Graphics%20Lab">New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab</a> as a Unix kernel programmer.

In 2002, Perens was a remote Senior Scientist for Open Source with the Cyber Security Policy Laboratory of <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a> under the direction of Tony Stanco. Stanco was director of the laboratory for a year, while its regular director was on sabbatical.

Between 2006 and 2007, Perens was a visiting lecturer and researcher for the <a href="University%20of%20Agder">University of Agder</a> under a three-year grant from the Competence Fund of Southern Norway. During this time he consulted the Norwegian Government and other entities on government policy issues related to computers and software. After this time Perens worked remotely on Agder programs, mainly concerning the European Internet Accessibility Observatory.

In 2007, some of Perens government advisory roles included a meeting with the President of the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies">Chamber of Deputies</a> (the lower house of parliament) in Italy and testimony to the Culture Committee of the Chamber of Deputies; a keynote speech at the foundation of Norway's Open Source Center, following Norway's Minister of Governmental Reform (Perens is on the advisory board of the center); he provided input on the revision of the <a href="European%20Interoperability%20Framework">European Interoperability Framework</a>; and he was keynote speaker at a European Commission conference on "Digital Business Ecosystems at the Centre Borschette, Brussels, on November 7".

In 2009, Perens acted as an <a href="expert%20witness">expert witness</a> on open source in the <a href="Jacobsen%20v.%20Katzer">Jacobsen v. Katzer</a> U.S. Federal lawsuit. His report, which was made publicly available by Jacobsen, presented the culture and impact of <a href="open-source%20software%20development">open-source software development</a> to the federal courts.

Perens delivered one of the keynote addresses at the 2012 <a href="linux.conf.au">linux.conf.au</a> conference in <a href="Ballarat">Ballarat</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. He discussed the need for open source software to market itself better to non-technical users. He also discussed some of the latest developments in open-source hardware, such as Papilio and Bus Pirate.

In 2013, Perens spoke in South America, as the closing keynote at Latinoware 2013. He was the keynote of CISL - Conferencia Internacional de Software Libre, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and keynoted a special event along with the Minister of software and innovation of Chubut Province, in Puerto Madrin, Patagonia, Argentina. He keynoted the Festival de Software Libre 2013, in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

In 2014-2015, Perens took a break from Open Source conferences, having spoken at them often since 1996. In 2016, he returned to the conference circuit, keynoting the Open Source Insight conference in Seoul, sponsored by the Copyright Commission of South Korea. Perens web site presently advertises his availability to keynote conferences as long as travel and lodging expenses are compensated.

Perens poses "Open Source" as a means of marketing the <a href="free%20and%20open-source%20software">free and open-source software</a> idea to business people and mainstream who might be more interested in the practical benefits of an open source development model and ecosystem than abstract ethics. He states that open source and free software are only two ways of talking about the same phenomenon, a point of view not shared by Stallman and his <a href="Free%20software">Free software</a> movement. Perens postulated in 2004 an economic theory for business use of Open Source in his paper "The Emerging Economic Paradigm of Open Source" and his speech "Innovation Goes Public". This differs from Raymond's theory in "<a href="The%20Cathedral%20and%20the%20Bazaar">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>", which having been written before there was much business involvement in open source, explains open source as a consequence of programmer motivation and leisure.

In February 2008, for the 10th anniversary of the phrase "open source", Perens published a message to the community called "State of Open Source Message: A New Decade For Open Source". Around the same time the ezine RegDeveloper published an interview with Perens where he spoke of the successes of open source, but also warned of dangers, including a proliferation of OSI-approved licenses which had not undergone legal scrutiny. He advocated the use of the <a href="GNU%20General%20Public%20License%23Version%203">GPLv3</a> license, especially noting <a href="Linus%20Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>' refusal to switch away from <a href="GNU%20General%20Public%20License%23Version%202">GPLv2</a> for the Linux kernel.

Bruce Perens supported <a href="Bernie%20Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> for President and he claims that his experience with the open source movement influenced that decision. On July 13, 2016, following Sanders endorsement of Clinton for president, Perens endorsed Clinton.

Perens is an avid <a href="amateur%20radio">amateur radio</a> enthusiast (<a href="call%20sign">call sign</a> K6BP) and maintained technocrat.net, which he closed in late 2008, because its revenues did not cover its costs.

Perens is featured in the 2001 documentary film "<a href="Revolution%20OS">Revolution OS</a>" and the 2006 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television documentary "<a href="The%20Code-Breakers">The Code-Breakers</a>".

From 2002 to 2006, Prentice Hall PTR published the <a href="Bruce%20Perens%27%20Open%20Source%20Series">Bruce Perens' Open Source Series</a>, a set of 24 books covering various open source software tools, for which Perens served as the series editor. It was the first book series to be published under an open license.

Perens lives in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a> with his wife, Valerie, and son, Stanley, born in 2000.

Bundle theory

Bundle theory, originated by the 18th century Scottish philosopher <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, is the <a href="ontology">ontological</a> theory about <a href="Object%20%28philosophy%29">objecthood</a> in which an object consists only of a collection ("bundle") of properties, relations or <a href="trope%20%28philosophy%29">tropes</a>.

According to bundle theory, an object consists of its properties and nothing more: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even "conceive" of such an object; for example, bundle theory claims that thinking of an apple compels one also to think of its color, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one other of its properties. Thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of its properties. In particular, there is no "<a href="substance%20theory">substance</a>" in which the properties are "<a href="inherence">inherent</a>".

The difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition.

The inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a "bare particular" (a "substance" without properties), an implication that directly opposes <a href="substance%20theory">substance theory</a>. The conceptual difficulty of "bare particulars" was illustrated by <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> when he described a "substance" by itself, apart from its properties, as ""something, I know not what. [...] The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or upholding.""

Whether a "relation" of an object is one of its properties may complicate such an argument. However, the argument concludes that the conceptual challenge of "bare particulars" leaves a bundle of properties and nothing more as the only possible conception of an object, thus justifying bundle theory.

Objections to bundle theory concern the nature of the "bundle of properties", the properties' "<a href="wikt%3Acompresence">compresence</a>" relation (the "togetherness" relation between those constituent properties), and the impact of language on understanding reality.

Bundle theory maintains that properties are "bundled" together in a collection without describing how they are tied together. For example, bundle theory regards an apple as red, four inches (100 mm) wide, and juicy but lacking an underlying "substance". The apple is said to be a "bundle of properties" including redness, being four inches (100 mm) wide, and juiciness.

Critics question how bundle theory accounts for the properties' "<a href="wikt%3Acompresence">compresence</a>" (the "togetherness" relation between those properties) without an underlying "substance". Critics also question how any two given properties are determined to be properties of the same object if there is no "substance" in which they both "inhere".

Traditional bundle theory explains the "compresence" of properties by defining an object as a collection of properties "bound" together. Thus, different combinations of properties and relations produce different objects. Redness and juiciness, for example, may be found together on top of the table because they are part of a bundle of properties located on the table, one of which is the "looks like an apple" property.

By contrast, <a href="substance%20theory">substance theory</a> explains the "compresence" of properties by asserting that the properties are found together because it is the "substance" that has those properties. In substance theory, a "substance" is the thing in which properties "inhere". For example, redness and juiciness are found on top of the table because redness and juiciness "inhere" in an apple, making the apple red and juicy.

The "bundle theory of substance" explains "compresence". Specifically, it maintains that properties' compresence itself engenders a "substance". Thus, it determines "substancehood" empirically by the "togetherness" of properties rather than by a "bare particular" or by any other non-empirical underlying strata. The "bundle theory of substance" thus rejects the substance theories of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, <a href="Descartes">Descartes</a>, and more recently, <a href="J.P.%20Moreland">J.P. Moreland</a>, Jia Hou, Joseph Bridgman, <a href="Quentin%20Smith">Quentin Smith</a>, and others.

The "language-reality" objection to bundle theory relates to the impact <a href="language">language</a> has on understanding <a href="reality">reality</a>. The objection maintains that language causes confusion that supports bundle theory.

Per the objection, properties are synthetic constructions of language and thinking alone provides reality to the properties of any object. An apple, it claims, does not have the properties "red" or "juicy", but rather observers who already believe in a concept called "Red" use that concept to experience an apple as red. Further, the objection maintains that "Red" cannot be distilled from an apple because "Red" is an abstraction from other experiences and not an innate property an apple might contain. Per the objection, expressions such as, "An apple is red and juicy," includes at least six concepts and would best be left as dead-end logical propositions. Since the objection regards the words "Red" and "Juicy" as simply abstractions of previous experiences, it contends that they contain only a personal summary concept of one individual. Thus, the experience of an apple is as close to the "Apple" concept that one can get. The objection regards any additional analytic work of the mind as a synthesis of other experiences that is incapable of logically revealing any true essence of "Apple".

The "language-reality" objection asserts that language encourages the belief that "synthetic exercises" distill experiences, yet it rejects the results of such exercises by maintaining that observers actually combine experiences to create each concept of any particular property. It holds that language is a complicated belief system whose only connection to reality is an abstraction of experience. The "language-reality" objection may even suggest that "reality/non-reality" or "objective/subjective" distinctions themselves are merely artifacts of language and therefore are also solely abstractions of experience.

The Buddhist <a href="Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a> philosopher, <a href="Chandrakirti">Chandrakirti</a>, used the aggregate nature of objects to demonstrate the lack of <a href="essence">essence</a> in what is known as the sevenfold reasoning. In his work, "<a href="Madhyamak%C4%81vat%C4%81ra">Guide to the Middle Way</a>" (<a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>: "Madhyamakāvatāra"), he says:

He goes on to explain what is meant by each of these seven assertions, but briefly in a subsequent commentary he explains that the conventions of the world do not exist essentially when closely analyzed, but exist only through being taken for granted, without being subject to scrutiny that searches for an essence within them.

Another view of the Buddhist theory of the self, especially in early Buddhism, is that the Buddhist theory is essentially an eliminativist theory. According to this understanding, the self can not be reduced to a bundle because there is nothing that answers to the concept of a self. Consequently, the idea of a self must be eliminated.

Bernard Montgomery

<a href="Field%20marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Field Marshal</a> Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, (; 17 November 1887 – 24 March 1976), nicknamed "Monty" and the "Spartan General", was a senior <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a> who fought in both the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> and the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>.

He saw action in the First World War as a junior officer of the <a href="Royal%20Warwickshire%20Regiment">Royal Warwickshire Regiment</a>. At <a href="M%C3%A9teren">Méteren</a>, near the Belgian border at <a href="Bailleul%2C%20Nord">Bailleul</a>, he was shot through the right <a href="human%20lung">lung</a> by a sniper, during the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">First Battle of Ypres</a>. He returned to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> as a general staff officer and took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a> in April/May 1917. He also took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a> in late 1917 before finishing the war as <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a> of the <a href="47th%20%281/2nd%20London%29%20Division">47th (2nd London) Division</a>.

In the <a href="Interwar%20period">inter-war years</a> he commanded the 17th (Service) Battalion, <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">Royal Fusiliers</a> and, later, the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment before becoming commander of <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">9th Infantry Brigade</a> and then <a href="General%20officer%20commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> (GOC) <a href="8th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">8th Infantry Division</a>.

During the Second World War he commanded the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Eighth Army</a> from August 1942 in the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert</a> until the final <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> <a href="Tunisia%20Campaign">victory in Tunisia</a> in May 1943. This command included the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>, a turning point in the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a>. He subsequently commanded the British Eighth Army during the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a> and the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">Allied invasion of Italy</a>. He was in command of all Allied ground forces during <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation "Overlord"</a> from the initial landings until after the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a>. He then continued in command of the <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a> for the rest of the <a href="North%20West%20Europe%20Campaign">campaign in North West Europe</a>. As such he was the principal field commander for the <a href="Operation%20Market%20Garden">failed airborne attempt to bridge the Rhine</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Arnhem">Arnhem</a>, and the <a href="Operation%20Plunder">Allied Rhine crossing</a>. On 4 May 1945 he took the <a href="German%20surrender%20at%20L%C3%BCneburg%20Heath">German surrender at Lüneburg Heath</a> in <a href="Northern%20Germany">Northern Germany</a>.

After the war he became Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a> (BAOR) in Germany and then <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a> (1946-8). He then served as Deputy Supreme Commander of <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in Europe until his retirement in 1958.

Montgomery was born in <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, in 1887, the fourth child of nine, to an <a href="Ulster-Scots%20people">Ulster-Scots</a> <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> <a href="Minister%20%28Christianity%29">minister</a>, <a href="The%20Reverend">The Reverend</a> <a href="Henry%20Montgomery%20%28bishop%29">Henry Montgomery</a>, and his wife, Maud ("née" Farrar). The Montgomerys, an '<a href="Protestant%20Ascendancy">Ascendancy</a>' <a href="gentry">gentry</a> family, were the <a href="County%20Donegal">County Donegal</a> branch of the <a href="Clan%20Montgomery">Clan Montgomery</a>. Henry Montgomery, at that time <a href="Vicar">Vicar</a> of <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Church%2C%20Kennington">St Mark's Church</a>, Kennington, was the second son of <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Montgomery">Sir Robert Montgomery</a>, a native of <a href="Inishowen">Inishowen</a> in <a href="County%20Donegal">County Donegal</a> in <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a>, the noted colonial administrator in <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, who died a month after his grandson's birth. He was probably a descendant of <a href="Alexander%20Montgomery%20%281686%E2%80%931729%29">Colonel Alexander Montgomery</a> (1686–1729). Bernard's mother, Maud, was the daughter of <a href="The%20Very%20Reverend">The V. Rev.</a> <a href="Frederic%20William%20Farrar">Frederic William Canon Farrar</a>, the famous preacher, and was eighteen years younger than her husband. After the death of Sir Robert Montgomery, Henry inherited the Montgomery ancestral estate of New Park in <a href="Moville%2C%20County%20Donegal">Moville</a> in <a href="Inishowen">Inishowen</a> in <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a>. There was still £13,000 to pay on a <a href="Mortgage%20loan">mortgage</a>, a large debt in the 1880s, and Henry was at the time still only an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> <a href="vicar">vicar</a>. Despite selling off all the farms that were at Ballynally, "there was barely enough to keep up New Park and pay for the blasted summer holiday" (i.e., at New Park).

It was a financial relief of some magnitude when, in 1889, Henry was made <a href="Bishop%20of%20Tasmania">Bishop of Tasmania</a>, then still a <a href="British%20colony">British colony</a> and Bernard spent his formative years there. <a href="Bishop">Bishop</a> Montgomery considered it his duty to spend as much time as possible in the rural areas of <a href="Colony%20of%20Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and was away for up to six months at a time. While he was away, his wife, still in her mid-twenties, gave her children "constant" beatings, then ignored them most of the time as she performed the public duties of the bishop's wife. Of Bernard's siblings, Sibyl died prematurely in Tasmania, and Harold, Donald and Una all emigrated. Maud Montgomery took little active interest in the education of her young children other than to have them taught by tutors brought from Britain. The loveless environment made Bernard something of a bully, as he himself recalled, "I was a dreadful little boy. I don't suppose anybody would put up with my sort of behaviour these days." Later in life Montgomery refused to allow his son <a href="David%20Montgomery%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">David</a> to have anything to do with his grandmother, and refused to attend her funeral in 1949.

The family returned to England once for a <a href="Lambeth%20Conference">Lambeth Conference</a> in 1897, and Bernard and his brother Harold were educated for a term at <a href="The%20King%27s%20School%2C%20Canterbury">The King's School, Canterbury</a>. In 1901, Bishop Montgomery became secretary of the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Propagation%20of%20the%20Gospel">Society for the Propagation of the Gospel</a>, and the family returned to London. Montgomery attended <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20School%20%28London%29">St Paul's School</a> and then the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>, from which he was almost expelled for rowdiness and violence. On graduation in September 1908 he was commissioned into the 1st Battalion the <a href="Royal%20Warwickshire%20Regiment">Royal Warwickshire Regiment</a> as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>, and first saw overseas service later that year in <a href="British%20India">India</a>. He was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a> in 1910, and in 1912 became adjutant of the 1st Battalion of his regiment at <a href="Shorncliffe%20Army%20Camp">Shorncliffe Army Camp</a>.

The <a href="World%20War%20I">Great War</a> began in August 1914 and Montgomery moved to France with his battalion that month, which was at the time part of the <a href="10th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">10th Brigade</a> of the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Division</a>. He saw action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Le%20Cateau">Battle of Le Cateau</a> that month and during the retreat from <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons">Mons</a>. At <a href="M%C3%A9teren">Méteren</a>, near the Belgian border at <a href="Bailleul%2C%20Nord">Bailleul</a> on 13 October 1914, during an Allied counter-offensive, he was shot through the right <a href="human%20lung">lung</a> by a sniper. Montgomery was hit once more, in the knee. He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for gallant leadership: the citation for this award, published in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" in December 1914 reads:

After recovering in early 1915, he was appointed to be <a href="brigade%20major">brigade major</a> first of <a href="112th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">112th Brigade</a> and then with <a href="104th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">104th Brigade</a> under training in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. He returned to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in early 1916 as a general staff officer in the <a href="33rd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">33rd Division</a> and took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a> in April/May 1917. He became a general staff officer with <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IX Corps</a>, part of <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Herbert%20Plumer%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Plumer">Sir Herbert Plumer</a>'s <a href="Second%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Second Army</a>, in July 1917.

Montgomery served at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a> in late 1917 before finishing the war as General Staff Officer Grade 1 and effectively <a href="chief%20of%20staff">Chief of Staff</a> of the <a href="47th%20%281/2nd%20London%29%20Division">47th (2nd London) Division</a>, with the temporary rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant colonel</a>. A photograph from October 1918, reproduced in many biographies, shows the then unknown Lieutenant Colonel Montgomery standing in front of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> (then the <a href="Minister%20of%20Munitions">Minister of Munitions</a>) at the parade following the liberation of <a href="Lille">Lille</a>.

After the First World War Montgomery commanded the 17th (Service) Battalion of the <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">Royal Fusiliers</a>, a battalion in the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a>, before reverting to his substantive rank of <a href="captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> (<a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">major</a>) in November 1919. He had not at first been selected for the <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College in Camberley</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> (his only hope of ever achieving high command). But at a tennis party in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, he was able to persuade the <a href="Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> (C-in-C) of the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of Occupation</a>, <a href="Field%20marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Sir%20William%20Robertson%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir William Robertson</a>, to add his name to the list.

After graduating from the Staff College, he was appointed <a href="brigade%20major">brigade major</a> in the <a href="17th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">17th Infantry Brigade</a> in January 1921. The brigade was stationed in <a href="County%20Cork">County Cork</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, carrying out counter-insurgency operations during the final stages of the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>.

Montgomery came to the conclusion that the conflict could not be won without harsh measures, and that self-government for Ireland was the only feasible solution; in 1923, after the establishment of the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> and during the <a href="Irish%20Civil%20War">Irish Civil War</a>, Montgomery wrote to <a href="Colonel%20%28British%20Army%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Arthur%20Percival">Arthur Ernest Percival</a> of the <a href="Essex%20Regiment">Essex Regiment</a>: 

In May 1923, Montgomery was posted to the <a href="49th%20%28West%20Riding%29%20Infantry%20Division">49th (West Riding) Infantry Division</a>, a <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> (TA) formation. He returned to the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1925 as a <a href="company%20commander">company commander</a> and was promoted to major in July 1925. From January 1926 to January 1929 he served as Deputy Assistant Adjutant General at the <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a>, in the temporary rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant colonel</a>.

In 1925, in his first known love affair, Montgomery, then in his late thirties, courted a 17-year-old girl, Miss Betty Anderson. His method of courtship apparently included drawing diagrams in the sand of how he would deploy his tanks and infantry in a future war, a contingency which seemed very remote at that time. She respected his ambition and single-mindedness, but declined his proposal of marriage.

In 1927, he met and married Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, Hobart, widow of <a href="Oswald%20Carver">Oswald Carver</a>, Olympic rowing medallist who had been killed in the First World War. Betty Carver was the sister of the future Second World War commander, <a href="Major-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major General</a> <a href="Percy%20Hobart">Sir Percy Hobart</a>. Betty Carver had two sons in their early teens, John and Dick, from her first marriage. Dick Carver later wrote that it had been "a very brave thing" for Montgomery to take on a widow with two children. Montgomery's son, <a href="David%20Montgomery%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">David</a>, was born in August 1928.

While on holiday in <a href="Burnham-on-Sea">Burnham-on-Sea</a> in 1937, Betty suffered an insect bite which became infected, and she died in her husband's arms from <a href="septicaemia">septicaemia</a> following <a href="amputation">amputation</a> of her leg. The loss devastated Montgomery, who was then serving as a brigadier, but he insisted on throwing himself back into his work immediately after the funeral. Montgomery's marriage had been extremely happy. Much of his correspondence with his wife was destroyed when his quarters at Portsmouth were bombed during the Second World War. After Montgomery's death, John Carver wrote that his mother had arguably done the country a favour by keeping his personal oddities – his extreme single-mindedness, and his intolerance of and suspicion of the motives of others – within reasonable bounds long enough for him to have a chance of attaining high command.

Both of Montgomery's stepsons became army officers in the 1930s (both were serving in India at the time of their mother's death), and both served in the Second World War, each eventually attaining the rank of Colonel. While serving as a GSO2 with Eighth Army, Dick Carver was sent forward during the pursuit after El Alamein to help identify a new site for Eighth Army HQ. He was taken prisoner at Mersa Matruh on 7 November 1942. Montgomery wrote to his contacts in England asking that inquiries be made via the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> as to where his stepson was being held, and that parcels be sent to him. Like many British POWs, the most famous being General <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor">Richard O'Connor</a>, Dick Carver escaped in September 1943 during the brief hiatus between Italy's departure from the war and the German seizure of the country. He eventually reached British lines on 5 December 1943, to the delight of his stepfather, who sent him home to Britain to recuperate.

In January 1929 Montgomery was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel. That month he returned to the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment again, as Commander of Headquarters Company; he went to the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> to help write the Infantry Training Manual in mid-1929. In 1931 Montgomery was promoted to substantive lieutenant colonel and became the <a href="Commanding%20officer">Commanding Officer</a> (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment and saw service in <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a> and <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a>. He was promoted to <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">colonel</a> in June 1934 (seniority from January 1932). He attended and was then recommended to become an instructor at the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> <a href="Command%20and%20Staff%20College">Staff College</a> (now the <a href="Pakistan%20Army">Pakistan Army</a> Staff College) in <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a>, British India.

On completion of his tour of duty in India, Montgomery returned to Britain in June 1937 where he took command of the <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">9th Infantry Brigade</a> with the temporary rank of <a href="Brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">brigadier</a>. His wife died that year.

In 1938, he organised an <a href="Amphibious%20warfare">amphibious</a> <a href="combined%20operations">combined operations</a> landing exercise that impressed the new C-in-C of <a href="Southern%20Command%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Southern Command</a>, General <a href="Archibald%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">Sir Archibald Percival Wavell</a>. He was promoted to major general on 14 October 1938 and took command of the <a href="8th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">8th Infantry Division</a> in Palestine. There he quashed an Arab revolt before returning in July 1939 to Britain, suffering a serious illness on the way, to command the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd (Iron) Infantry Division</a>. On hearing of the rebel defeat in April 1939, Montgomery said, "I shall be sorry to leave Palestine in many ways, as I have enjoyed the war out here".

Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. The 3rd Division was deployed to Belgium as part of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF). During this time, Montgomery faced serious trouble from his military superiors and the clergy for his frank attitude regarding the sexual health of his soldiers, but was defended from dismissal by his superior <a href="Alan%20Brooke%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Alanbrooke">Alan Brooke</a>, commander of <a href="British%20II%20Corps">II Corps</a>. Montgomery's training paid off when the Germans began their invasion of the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> on 10 May 1940 and the 3rd Division advanced to the River <a href="Dijle">Dijle</a> and then withdrew to <a href="Dunkirk%2C%20France">Dunkirk</a> with great professionalism, entering the Dunkirk perimeter in a famous night-time march that placed his forces on the left flank, which had been left exposed by the Belgian surrender. The 3rd Division returned to Britain intact with minimal casualties. During <a href="Operation%20Dynamo">Operation Dynamo</a> — the evacuation of 330,000 BEF and French troops to Britain — Montgomery assumed command of the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">II Corps</a>.

On his return Montgomery antagonised the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> with trenchant criticisms of the command of the BEF and was briefly relegated back to divisional command of 3rd Division. He was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>. 3rd Division was at that time the only fully equipped division in Britain.

Montgomery was ordered to make ready his 3rd division to invade the neutral <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. Models of the islands were prepared and detailed plans worked out for the invasion. The invasion plans did not go ahead and plans switched to invading <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> island also belonging to neutral Portugal. These invasion plans also did not go ahead. Montgomery was then ordered to prepare plans for the invasion of neutral Ireland and to seize <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>, <a href="Cobh">Cobh</a> and Cork harbour. These invasion plans like those of the Portuguese islands also did not go ahead and in July 1940, Montgomery was appointed acting <a href="lieutenant-general">lieutenant-general</a>, placed in command of <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">V Corps</a>, responsible for the defence of <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> and <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, and started a long-running feud with the new commander-in-chief, Southern Command, <a href="Claude%20Auchinleck">Claude Auchinleck</a>.

In April 1941, he became commander of <a href="British%20XII%20Corps">XII Corps</a> responsible for the defence of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. During this period he instituted a regime of continuous training and insisted on high levels of physical fitness for both officers and other ranks. He was ruthless in sacking officers he considered would be unfit for command in action. Promoted to temporary lieutenant-general in July, in December Montgomery was given command of <a href="Aldershot%20Command">South-Eastern Command</a> overseeing the defence of Kent, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> and <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>.

He renamed his command the South-Eastern Army to promote offensive spirit. During this time he further developed and rehearsed his ideas and trained his soldiers, culminating in <a href="Exercise%20Tiger%20%281942%29">Exercise Tiger</a> in May 1942, a combined forces <a href="Military%20exercise">exercise</a> involving 100,000 troops.

In 1942, a new field commander was required in the Middle East, where Auchinleck was fulfilling both the role of <a href="Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-chief</a> <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a> and commander <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a>. He had stabilised the Allied position at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">First Battle of El Alamein</a>, but after a visit in August 1942, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, replaced him as Commander-in-chief with General <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Sir Harold Alexander</a> and <a href="William%20Gott">William Gott</a> as commander of the Eighth Army in the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert</a>. After Gott was killed flying back to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> Churchill was persuaded by Brooke, who by this time was <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a> (CIGS), to appoint Montgomery, who had only just been nominated to replace Alexander as commander of the British ground forces for <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>.

A story, probably apocryphal but popular at the time, is that the appointment caused Montgomery to remark that "After having an easy war, things have now got much more difficult." A colleague is supposed to have told him to cheer up – at which point Montgomery said "I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Rommel</a>!"

Montgomery's assumption of command transformed the fighting spirit and abilities of the Eighth Army. Taking command on 13 August 1942, he immediately became a whirlwind of activity. He ordered the creation of the <a href="X%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">X Corps</a>, which contained all armoured divisions to fight alongside his <a href="XXX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XXX Corps</a> which was all infantry divisions. This was in no way similar to a German Panzer Corps. One of Rommel's Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one corps commander. The only common commander for Montgomery's all infantry and all armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself. <a href="Correlli%20Barnett">Correlli Barnett</a> commented that Montgomery's solution "... was in every way opposite to Auchinleck's and in every way wrong, for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further." Montgomery reinforced the long front line at El Alamein, something that would take two months to accomplish. He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions (<a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division">51st Highland</a> and <a href="44th%20%28Home%20Counties%29%20Division">44th Home Counties</a>) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order better to coordinate combined operations.

Montgomery was determined that the Army, Navy and Air Forces should fight their battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan. He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>, to attack with the heights as his objective, something that Rommel soon did. Montgomery ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. "I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal. If we are attacked, then there will be no retreat. If we cannot stay here alive, then we will stay here dead", he told his officers at the first meeting he held with them in the desert, though, in fact, Auchinleck had no plans to withdraw from the strong defensive position he had chosen and established at El Alamein.

Montgomery made a great effort to appear before troops as often as possible, frequently visiting various units and making himself known to the men, often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed. Although he still wore a standard British officer's cap on arrival in the desert, he briefly wore an Australian broad-brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret (with the badge of the <a href="Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">Royal Tank Regiment</a> next to the British General Officer's badge) for which he became notable. The black beret was offered to him by Jim Fraser while the latter was driving him on an inspection tour. Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the transformation in atmosphere when they visited on 19 August, less than a week after Montgomery had taken command.

Rommel attempted to turn the left flank of the Eighth Army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Battle of Alam el Halfa</a> from 31 August 1942. The German/Italian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw urgently lest their retreat through the British minefields be cut off. Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking the retreating forces immediately, but he felt strongly that his methodical build-up of British forces was not yet ready. A hasty counter-attack risked ruining his strategy for an offensive on his own terms in late October, planning for which had begun soon after he took command. He was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant-general in mid October.

The conquest of Libya was essential for airfields to support <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and to threaten the rear of Axis forces opposing <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>. Montgomery prepared meticulously for the new offensive after convincing Churchill that the time was not being wasted. (Churchill sent a telegram to Alexander on 23 September 1942 which began, "We are in your hands and of course a victorious battle makes amends for much delay.") He was determined not to fight until he thought there had been sufficient preparation for a decisive victory, and put into action his beliefs with the gathering of resources, detailed planning, the training of troops—especially in clearing minefields and fighting at night—and in the use of 252 of the latest American-built <a href="Sherman%20tank">Sherman tank</a>s, 90 <a href="M7%20Priest">M7 Priest</a> self-propelled howitzers, and making a personal visit to every unit involved in the offensive. By the time the offensive was ready in late October, Eighth Army had 231,000 men on its ration strength.

The <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a> began on 23 October 1942, and ended 12 days later with one of the first large-scale, decisive Allied land victories of the war. Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500). Soon after Allied armoured units and infantry broke through the German and Italian lines and were pursuing the enemy forces at speed along the coast road, a violent rainstorm burst over the region, bogging down the tanks and support trucks in the desert mud. Montgomery, standing before his officers at headquarters and close to tears, announced that he was forced to call off the pursuit. Historian Corelli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit the breakthrough, but nevertheless the Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000 <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> were taken, including the German second-in-command, <a href="Ritter%20von%20Thoma">General von Thoma</a>, as well as eight other general officers. Rommel, having been in a hospital in Germany at the start of the battle, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after <a href="Georg%20Stumme">Stumme</a> – his replacement as German commander – died of a heart attack in the early hours of the battle.

Montgomery was advanced to <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">KCB</a> and promoted to full <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">general</a>. He kept the initiative, applying superior strength when it suited him, forcing Rommel out of each successive defensive position. On 6 March 1943, Rommel's attack on the over-extended Eighth Army at <a href="Medenine">Medenine</a> (<a href="Operation%20Capri">Operation Capri</a>) with the largest concentration of German armour in North Africa was successfully repulsed. At the <a href="Mareth%20Line">Mareth Line</a>, 20 to 27 March, when Montgomery encountered fiercer frontal opposition than he had anticipated, he switched his major effort into an outflanking inland pincer, backed by low-flying <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> fighter-bomber support. For his role in North Africa he was awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> by the United States government in the rank of Chief Commander.

The next major Allied attack was the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a> (Operation Husky). Montgomery considered the initial plans for the Allied invasion, which had been agreed in principle by <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, the <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a> <a href="Mediterranean%20Theater%20of%20Operations">Mediterranean</a>, and General Alexander, the <a href="15th%20Army%20Group">15th Army Group</a> commander, to be unworkable because of the dispersion of effort. He managed to have the plans recast to concentrate the Allied forces, having <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20S.%20Patton">George Patton</a>'s <a href="Seventh%20United%20States%20Army">US Seventh Army</a> land in the Gulf of Gela (on the Eighth Army's left flank, which landed around <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> in the south-east of Sicily) rather than near <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> in the west and north of Sicily. Inter-Allied tensions grew as the American commanders, Patton and <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a> (then commanding <a href="II%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">US II Corps</a> under Patton), took umbrage at what they saw as Montgomery's attitudes and boastfulness.

During late 1943, Montgomery continued to command the Eighth Army during the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">landings on the mainland of Italy itself</a>, beginning with <a href="Operation%20Baytown">Operation Baytown</a>. In conjunction with the Anglo-American <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy%23Salerno%20landings">landings at Salerno</a> (near <a href="Naples">Naples</a>) by <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark Clark</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Army%20North">US Fifth Army</a> and <a href="Operation%20Slapstick">seaborne landings by British paratroops</a> in the heel of Italy (including the key port of Taranto, where they disembarked without resistance directly into the port), Montgomery led the Eighth Army <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">up the toe of Italy</a>. Montgomery abhorred the lack of coordination, the dispersion of effort, the strategic muddle and lack of opportunism he saw in the Allied effort in Italy and was glad to leave the "dog's breakfast" on 23 December 1943.

Montgomery returned to Britain in January 1944. He was assigned to command the <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a> consisting of all Allied ground forces participating in <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>, the invasion of <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>. Overall direction was assigned to the <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a> of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. Both Churchill and Eisenhower had found Montgomery difficult to work with in the past and wanted the position to go to the more affable General <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Sir Harold Alexander</a>. However Montgomery's patron, Alan Brooke, firmly argued that Montgomery was a much superior general to Alexander and ensured his appointment. Without Brooke's support, Montgomery would have remained in Italy. At <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20School%20%28London%29">St Paul's School</a> on 7 April and 15 May Montgomery presented his strategy for the invasion. He envisaged a ninety-day battle, with all forces reaching the <a href="Seine">Seine</a>. The campaign would pivot on an Allied-held <a href="Caen">Caen</a> in the east of the Normandy bridgehead, with relatively static British and Canadian armies forming a shoulder to attract and defeat German counter-attacks, relieving the US armies who would move and seize the <a href="Cotentin%20Peninsula">Cotentin Peninsula</a> and <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, wheeling south and then east on the right forming a pincer.
During the ten weeks of the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a>, unfavourable autumnal weather conditions disrupted the Normandy landing areas. Montgomery's initial plan was for the Anglo-Canadian troops under his command to break out immediately from their beachheads on the Calvados coast towards Caen with the aim of taking the city on either D Day or two days later. Montgomery attempted to take Caen with the 3rd Infantry Division, <a href="50th%20%28Northumbrian%29%20Infantry%20Division">50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division</a> and the 3rd Canadian Division but was stopped from 6–8 June by 21st Panzer Division and <a href="12th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hitlerjugend">12th SS Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend"</a>, who hit the advancing Anglo-Canadian troops very hard. Rommel followed up this success by ordering the 2nd Panzer Division to Caen while Field Marshal <a href="Gerd%20von%20Rundstedt">Gerd von Rundstedt</a> asked for and received permission from Hitler to have the elite 1st Waffen SS Division "Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler" and 2nd Waffen SS Division "Das Reich" sent to Caen as well. Montgomery thus had to face what Stephen Badsey called the "most formidable" of all the German divisions in France. The 12th Waffen SS Division "Hitlerjugend" as its name implies was drawn entirely from the more fanatical elements of the Hitler Youth and commanded by the ruthless SS-"Brigadeführer" <a href="Kurt%20Meyer">Kurt Meyer</a>, aka "Panzer Meyer".

The failure to take Caen immediately has been the source of an immense historiographical dispute with bitter nationalist overtones. Broadly, there has been a "British school" which accepts Montgomery's post-war claim that he never intended to take Caen at once, and instead the Anglo-Canadian operations around Caen were a "holding operation" intended to attract the bulk of the German forces towards the Caen sector to allow the Americans to stage the "break out operation" on the left flank of the German positions, which was all part of Montgomery's "Master Plan" that he had conceived long before the Normandy campaign. By contrast, the "American school" argued that Montgomery's initial "master plan" was for the 21st Army Group to take Caen at once, move his tank divisions into the plains south of Caen to stage a breakout that would lead the 21st Army Group into the plains of northern France and hence into <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and finally the <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr</a>. Letters written by Eisenhower at the time of the battle make it clear that Eisenhower was expecting from Montgomery "the early capture of the important focal point of Caen". Later, when this plan had clearly failed, Eisenhower wrote that Montgomery had "evolved" the plan to have the US forces achieve the break-out instead.

As the campaign progressed, Montgomery altered his initial plan for the invasion and continued the strategy of attracting and holding German counter-attacks in the area north of Caen rather than to the south, to allow the US First Army in the west to take Cherbourg. A memo summarising Montgomery's operations written by Eisenhower's <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a>, General <a href="Walter%20Bedell%20Smith">Walter Bedell Smith</a> who met with Montgomery in late June 1944 says nothing about Montgomery conducting a "holding operation" in the Caen sector, and instead speaks of him seeking a "breakout" into the plains south of the Seine. On 12 June, Montgomery ordered the 7th Armoured Division into an attack against the <a href="Panzer%20Lehr%20Division">Panzer Lehr Division</a> that made good progress at first but ended when the Panzer Lehr was joined by the 2nd Panzer Division. At Villers Bocage on 14 June, the British lost twenty Cromwell tanks to five Tiger tanks led by SS "Obersturmführer" <a href="Michael%20Wittmann">Michael Wittmann</a> in about five minutes. Despite the setback at Villers Bocage, Montgomery was still optimistic as the Allies were landing more troops and supplies than they were losing in battle, and though the German lines were holding, the "Wehrmacht" and "Waffen SS" were suffering considerable attrition. Air Marshal Sir <a href="Arthur%20Tedder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tedder">Arthur Tedder</a> complained that it was impossible to move fighter squadrons to France until Montgomery had captured some airfields, something he asserted that Montgomery appeared incapable of doing. The first V-1 attacks on London, which started on 13 June further increased the pressure on Montgomery from Whitehall to speed up his advance.

On 18 June, Montgomery ordered Bradley to take Cherbourg while the British were to take Caen by 23 June. In Operation Epsom, the British VII Corps commanded by Sir <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor">Richard O'Connor</a> attempted to outflank Caen from the west by breaking through the dividing line between the Panzer Lehr and the 12th SS to take the strategic Hill 112. Epsom began well with O'Connor's assault force, the British 15th Scottish Division breaking through and with the 11th Armoured Division stopping the counter-attacks of the 12th SS Division. General <a href="Friedrich%20Dollmann">Friedrich Dollmann</a> of the 7th Army had to commit the newly arrived II SS Corps to stop the British offensive. Dollmann, fearing that Epsom would be a success, committed suicide and was replaced by SS "Oberstegruppenführer" <a href="Paul%20Hausser">Paul Hausser</a>. O'Connor, at the cost of about 4,000 men, had won a salient deep and wide but placed the Germans into an unviable long-term position. There was a strong sense of crisis in the Allied command as the Allies had advanced only about inland, at a time when their plans called for them to have already taken Rennes, Alençon and St. Malo. After Epsom, Montgomery had to tell <a href="General">General</a> <a href="Harry%20Crerar">Harry Crerar</a> that the activation of the First Canadian Army would have to wait as there was room at present in the Caen sector only for the newly arrived XII Corps under General <a href="Neil%20Ritchie">Neil Ritchie</a>, which caused some tension with Crerar who was anxious to get into the field. Epsom had forced further German forces into Caen but all through June and the first half of July Rommel, Rundstedt and Hitler were engaged in planning for a great offensive to drive the British into the sea; it was never launched and would have required the commitment of a large number of German forces to the Caen sector).

It was only after several failed attempts to break out in the Caen sector that Montgomery devised what he later called his "master plan" of having the 21st Army Group hold the bulk of the German forces, thus allowing the Americans to break out. The Canadian historians <a href="Terry%20Copp">Terry Copp</a> and Robert Vogel wrote about the dispute between the "American school" and "British school" after having suffered several setbacks in June 1944:

Hampered by stormy weather and the <a href="bocage">bocage</a> terrain, Montgomery had to ensure Rommel focused on the British in the east rather than the Americans in the west, who had to take the Cotentin Peninsula and Brittany before the Germans could be trapped by a general swing east. Montgomery told General Sir <a href="Miles%20Dempsey">Miles Dempsey</a>, the commander of the 2nd British Army: "Go on hitting, drawing the German strength, especially some of the armour, on to yourself – so as to ease the way for Brad [Bradley]." The Germans had deployed 12 divisions, of which six were Panzer divisions against the British while deploying 8 divisions, of which 3 were Panzer divisions against the Americans. By the middle of July Caen had not been taken, as Rommel continued to prioritise prevention of the break-out by British forces rather than the western territories being taken by the Americans. This was broadly as Montgomery had planned, albeit not with the same speed as he outlined at St Paul's, although as the American historian Carlo D'Este pointed out the actual situation in Normandy was "vastly different" from what was envisioned at the St. Paul's conference as only one of four goals outlined in May had been achieved by 10 July.

On 7 July, Montgomery began Operation Charnwood with a carpet bombing offensive that turned much of the French countryside and the city of Caen into a wasteland. The British and Canadians succeeded in advancing into northern Caen before the Germans who used the ruins to their advantage and stopped the offensive. On 10 July, Montgomery ordered Bradley to take Avranches, after which the 3rd US Army would be activated to drive towards Le Mans and Alençon. On 14 July 1944, Montgomery wrote to his patron Brooke, saying he had chosen on a "real show down on the eastern flanks, and to loose a Corps of three armoured divisions in the open country about the Caen-Falaise road...The possibilities are immense; with seven hundred tanks loosed to the South-east of Caen, and the armoured cars operating far ahead, anything can happen." The <a href="French%20Resistance%23Role%20in%20the%20liberation%20of%20France%20and%20casualties">French Resistance had launched Plan Violet</a> in June 1944 to systematically destroy the telephone system of France, which forced the Germans to use their radios more and more to communicate, and as the code-breakers of Bletchley Park had broken many of the German codes, Montgomery had - via Ultra intelligence - a good idea of the German situation. Montgomery thus knew German Army Group B had lost 96,400 men while receiving 5,200 replacements and the Panzer Lehr Division now based at St. Lô was down to only 40 tanks. Montgomery later wrote that he knew he had the Normandy campaign won at this point as the Germans had almost no reserves while he had three armoured divisions in reserve.

An American break-out was achieved with <a href="Operation%20Cobra">Operation Cobra</a> and the encirclement of German forces in the <a href="Falaise%20pocket">Falaise pocket</a> at the cost of British losses with the diversionary <a href="Operation%20Goodwood">Operation Goodwood</a>. On the early morning of 18 July 1944, Operation Goodwood began with British heavy bombers beginning carpet bombing attacks that further devastated what was left of Caen and the surrounding countryside. A British tank crewman from the Guards Armoured Division later recalled: "At 0500 hours a distant thunder in the air brought all the sleepy-eyed tank crews out of their blankets. 1,000 Lancasters were flying from the sea in groups of three or four at . Ahead of them the pathfinders were scattering their flares and before long the first bombs were dropping". A German tankman from the 21st Panzer Division at the receiving end of this bombardment remembered: "We saw little dots detach themselves from the planes, so many of them that the crazy thought occurred to us: are those leaflets?...Among the thunder of the explosions, we could hear the wounded scream and the insane howling of men who had [been] driven mad". The British bombing had badly smashed the German front-line units; e.g. tanks were thrown up on the roofs of French farmhouses. Initially, the three British armoured divisions assigned to lead the offensive, the 7th, 11th and the Guards, made rapid progress and were soon approaching the Borguebus ridge, which dominated the landscape south of Caen by noon.

If the British could take the Borguebus ridge, the way to the plains of northern France would be wide open, and potentially Paris could be taken, which explains the ferocity with which the Germans defended the Borguebus ridge. One German officer, Lieutenant Baron von Rosen recalled that to motivate a Luftwaffe officer commanding a battery of four 88mm guns to fight against the British tanks that he had to hold his handgun to his head "...and asked him whether he would like to be killed immediately or get a high decoration. He decided for the latter". The well dug-in 88mm guns around the Borguebus ridge began taking a toll of the British Sherman tanks and the countryside was soon dotted with dozens of burning Shermans. One British officer reported with worry: "I see palls of smoke and tanks brewing up with flames belching forth from their turrets. I see men climbing out, on fire like torches, rolling on the ground to try and douse the flames". Despite Montgomery's orders to try to press on, fierce German counter-attacks stopped the British offensive.

The objectives of Operation Goodwood were all achieved except the complete capture of the Bourgebus Ridge, which was partially taken. The operation was a strategic Allied success in drawing in the last German reserves in Normandy towards the Caen sector away from the American sector, greatly assisting the American break out in Operation Cobra. By the end of Goodwood on 25 July 1944, the Canadians had finally taken Caen while the British tanks had reached the plains south of Caen, giving Montgomery the "hinge" he had been seeking, while forcing the Germans to commit the last of their reserves to stop the Anglo-Canadian offensive. Ultra decrypts indicated that the Germans now facing Bradley were seriously understrength with Operation Cobra about to commence. During Operation Goodwood, the British had 400 tanks knocked out with many recovered returning to service. The casualties were 5,500 with of ground gained. Bradley recognised Montgomery's plan to pin down German armour and allow US forces to break out:
"The British and Canadian armies were to decoy the enemy reserves and draw them to their front on the extreme eastern edge of the Allied beachhead. Thus, while Monty taunted the enemy at Caen, we [the Americans] were to make our break on the long roundabout road to Paris. When reckoned in terms of national pride, this British decoy mission became a sacrificial one, for while we tramped around the outside flank, the British were to sit in place and pin down the Germans. Yet strategically it fitted into a logical division of labors, for it was towards Caen that the enemy reserves would race once the alarm was sounded."

The long running dispute over what Montgomery's "master plan" in Normandy was, led historians to differ greatly about the purpose of Goodwood. The British journalist <a href="Mark%20Urban">Mark Urban</a>, wrote that the purpose of Goodwood was to draw German troops to their left flank to allow the Americans to breakout on the right flank, arguing that Montgomery had to lie to his soldiers about the purpose of Goodwood as the average British soldier would not have understood why they were being asked to create a diversion to allow the Americans to have the glory of staging the breakout with Operation Cobra. By contrast, the American historian Stephen Power argued that Goodwood was intended to be the "breakout" offensive and not a "holding operation", writing: "It is unrealistic to assert that an operation which called for the use of 4,500 Allied aircraft, 700 artillery pieces and over 8,000 armored vehicles and trucks and that cost the British over 5,500 casualties was conceived and executed for so limited an objective". Power noted that Goodwood and Cobra were supposed to take effect on the same day, 18 July 1944, but Cobra was cancelled owing to heavy rain in the American sector, and argued that both operations were meant to be breakout operations to trap the German armies in Normandy. American military writer Drew Middleton wrote that there is no doubt that Montgomery wanted Goodwood to provide a "shield" for Bradley, but at the same time Montgomery was clearly hoping for more than merely diverting German attention away from the American sector. British historian <a href="John%20Keegan">John Keegan</a> pointed out that Montgomery made differing statements before Goodwood about the purpose of the operation. Keegan wrote that Montgomery engaged in what he called a "hedging of his bets" when drafting his plans for Goodwood, with a plan for a "break out if the front collapsed, if not, sound documentary evidence that all he had intended in the first place was a battle of attrition". With Goodwood drawing the Wehrmacht towards the British sector, the 1st American Army enjoyed a two to one numerical superiority and General <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a> had accepted Montgomery's advice to begin the offensive by concentrating at one point instead of a "broad front" as Eisenhower would have preferred.

Operation Goodwood almost cost Montgomery his job, as Eisenhower seriously considered sacking him and only chose not to do so because to sack the popular "Monty" would have caused such a political backlash in Britain against the Americans at a critical moment in the war that the resulting strains in the Atlantic alliance were not considered worth it. Montgomery expressed his satisfaction at the results of Goodwood when calling the operation off. Eisenhower was under the impression that Goodwood was to be a break out operation. There was a miscommunication between the two men or Eisenhower did not understand the strategy. Alan Brooke chief of the British Imperial General Staff wrote: "Ike knows nothing about strategy and is quite unsuited to the post of Supreme Commander. It is no wonder that Monty's real high ability is not always realised" Bradley fully understood Montgomery's intentions. Both men would not give away to the press the true intentions of their strategy.

Many American officers had found Montgomery a difficult man to work with, and after Goodwood, pressured Eisenhower to fire Montgomery. Although the Eisenhower-Montgomery dispute is sometimes depicted in nationalist terms as being an Anglo-American struggle, it was the British Air Marshal <a href="Arthur%20Tedder">Arthur Tedder</a> who was pressing Eisenhower most strongly after Goodwood to fire Montgomery. An American officer wrote in his diary that Tedder had come to see Eisenhower to "pursue his current favourite subject, the sacking of Monty". With Tedder leading the "sack Monty" campaign, it encouraged Montgomery's American enemies to press Eisenhower to fire Montgomery. Brooke was sufficiently worried about the "sack Monty" campaign to visit Montgomery at his Tactical Headquarters (TAC) in France and as he wrote in his diary; "warned [Montgomery] of a tendency in the PM [Churchill] to listen to suggestions that Monty played for safety and was not prepared to take risks". Brooke advised Montgomery to invite Churchill to Normandy, arguing that if the "sack Monty" campaign had won the Prime Minister over, then his career would be over as having Churchill's backing would give Eisenhower the political "cover" to fire Montgomery. On 20 July, Montgomery met Eisenhower and on 21 July Churchill at the TAC in France. One of Montgomery's staff officers wrote afterwards that it was "common knowledge at Tac that Churchill had come to sack Monty". No notes were taken at the Eisenhower-Montgomery and Churchill-Montgomery meetings, but Montgomery was able to persuade both men not to fire him.

With the success of Cobra, which was soon followed by unleashing the 3rd American Army under the General <a href="George%20S.%20Patton">George S. Patton</a>, Eisenhower wrote to Montgomery: "Am delighted that your basic plan has begun brilliantly to unfold with Bradley's initial success". The success of Cobra was aided by Operation Spring when the II Canadian Corps under General <a href="Guy%20Simonds">Guy Simonds</a> (the only Canadian general whose skill Montgomery respected) began an offensive south of Caen that made little headway, but which the Germans regarded as the main offensive. Once the 3rd American Army arrived, Bradley was promoted to take command of the newly created 12th Army Group consisting of 1st and 3rd American Armies. Following the American breakout, there followed the Battle of Falaise Gap as the British, Canadian and Polish soldiers of 21st Army Group commanded by Montgomery advanced south while the American and French soldiers of Bradley's 12th Army Group advanced north to encircle the German Army Group B at Falaise as Montgomery waged what Urban called "a huge battle of annihilation" in August 1944. Montgomery began his offensive into the "Suisse Normande" region with <a href="Operation%20Bluecoat">Operation Bluecoat</a> with <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor">Richard O'Connor</a>'s VIII Corps and <a href="Gerard%20Bucknall">Gerard Bucknall</a>'s XXX Corps heading south. A dissatisfied Montgomery sacked Bucknall for being insufficiently aggressive and replaced him with General <a href="Brian%20Horrocks">Brian Horrocks</a>. At the same time, Montgomery ordered that Patton whose Third Army was supposed to advance into Brittany to send only minimal forces and instead ordered that Patton was to capture <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a>, which was soon taken.

Hitler waited too long to order his soldiers to retreat from Normandy, leading Montgomery to write: "He [Hitler] refused to face the only sound military course. As a result the Allies caused the enemy staggering losses in men and materials". Knowing via Ultra that Hitler was not planning to retreat from Normandy, Montgomery, on 6 August 1944, ordered that an envelopment operation against Army Group B with the First Canadian Army under Harry Crerar, which was to advance towards Falaise, the Second British Army under Sir <a href="Miles%20Dempsey">Miles Dempsey</a> was to advance towards <a href="Argentan">Argentan</a> and the Third American Army under <a href="George%20S.%20Patton">George S. Patton</a> was to advance to <a href="Alen%C3%A7on">Alençon</a>. On 11 August, Montgomery changed his plan with the Canadians to take Falaise and to meet the Americans at Argentan. The First Canadian Army launched two operations, Operation Totalize on 7 August which advanced only in four days in the face of fierce German resistance and Operation Tractable on 14 August which finally took Falaise on 17 August. In view of the slow Canadian advance, Patton requested permission to take Falaise, but was refused by Bradley on 13 August, which prompted much controversy with many historians arguing that Bradley lacked aggression and that Montgomery should have overruled Bradley. The so-called "Falaise Gap" was closed on 22 August 1944, but several American generals, most notably Patton, accused Montgomery of being insufficiently aggressive in closing it, about 60,000 German soldiers were trapped in Normandy, but before 22 August, about 20,000 Germans had escaped through the "Falaise Gap" to fight another day. About 10,000 Germans had been killed in the Battle of the Falaise Gap, which led to a stunned Eisenhower, who viewed the battlefield on 24 August, to comment with horror that it was impossible to walk without stepping on corpses.
The successful conclusion of the Normandy campaign saw the beginning of the debate between the "American school" and "British school" as both American and British generals started to advance claims about who was most responsible for this victory. Brooke wrote in defence of his protégé Montgomery: "Ike knows nothing about strategy and is "quite" unsuited to the post of Supreme Commander. It is no wonder that Monty's real high ability is not always realised. Especially so when 'national' spectacles pervert the perspective of the strategic landscape". About Montgomery's conduct of the Normandy campaign, Badsey wrote: "Too much discussion on Normandy has centered on the controversial decisions of the Allied commanders. It was not good enough, apparently, to win such a complete and spectacular victory over an enemy that had conquered most of Europe unless it was done perfectly. Most of the blame for this lies with Montgomery, who was foolish enough to insist that it "had" been done perfectly, that Normandy – and all his other battles – had been fought accordingly to a precise master plan drawn up beforehand, from which he never deviated. It says much for his personality that Montgomery found others to agree with him, despite overwhelmingly evidence to the contrary. His handling of the Battle of Normandy was of a very high order, and as the person who would certainly have been blamed for losing the battle, he deserves the credit for winning it".

<a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> took over Ground Forces Command on 1 September, while continuing as Supreme Commander, with Montgomery continuing to command the 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units. Montgomery bitterly resented this change, although it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion. The British journalist <a href="Mark%20Urban">Mark Urban</a> writes that Montgomery seemed unable to grasp that as the majority of the 2.2 million Allied soldiers fighting against Germany on the Western Front were now American (the ratio was 3:1) that it was politically unacceptable to American public opinion to have Montgomery remain as Land Forces Commander as: "Politics would not allow him to carry on giving orders to great armies of Americans simply because, in his view, he was better than their generals".

Winston Churchill had Montgomery promoted to <a href="Field%20marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">field marshal</a> by way of compensation. In September 1944, Montgomery ordered Crerar and his First Canadian Army to take the French ports on the English Channel, namely Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk. On 4 September, Antwerp, the third largest port in Europe was captured by Horrocks, with its harbour mostly intact. The "<a href="Witte%20Brigade">Witte Brigade</a>" (White Brigade) of the Belgian resistance had captured the <a href="Port%20of%20Antwerp">Port of Antwerp</a>, before the Germans could destroy the port. Antwerp was a deep water inland port connected to the North Sea via the river <a href="Scheldt">Scheldt</a>. The Scheldt was wide enough and dredged deep enough to allow the passage of ocean-going ships.

On 3 September 1944 Hitler ordered the 15th German Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries to hold the mouth of the river Scheldt to deprive the Allies of the use of Antwerp. Thanks to ULTRA, Montgomery was aware of Hitler's order by 5 September. Starting that same day, SHAEF's naval commander, Admiral Sir <a href="Bertram%20Ramsay">Bertram Ramsay</a> had urged Montgomery to make clearing the mouth of the Schedlt his number one priority, arguing that as long as the mouth of the Scheldt was in German hands, it was impossible for the Royal Navy to clear the mines in the river, and as the Scheldt was mined, the port of Antwerp was useless. Alone among the senior commanders, only Ramsay saw opening Antwerp as crucial.

On 6 September 1944, Montgomery told Crerar that "I want Boulogne badly" and that city should be taken no matter what the cost. By this point, ports like Cherbourg were too far away from the front line, causing the Allies great logistical problems. The importance of ports closer to Germany was highlighted with the liberation of the city of Le Havre, which was assigned to <a href="John%20Crocker">John Crocker</a>'s I Corps. To take Le Havre, two infantry divisions, two tank brigades, most of the artillery of the Second British Army, the specialized armoured "gadgets" of <a href="Percy%20Hobart">Percy Hobart</a>'s 79th Armoured Division, the battleship HMS "Warspite" and the monitor HMS "Erebus" were all committed. On 10 September 1944, Bomber Command dropped 4,719 tons of bombs on Le Havre, which was the prelude to <a href="Operation%20Astonia">Operation Astonia</a>, the assault on Le Havre by Crocker's men, which was taken two days later. The Canadian historian <a href="Terry%20Copp">Terry Copp</a> wrote that the commitment of this much firepower and men to take only one French city might "seem excessive", but by this point, the Allies desperately needed ports closer to the front line to sustain their advance.

On 9 September, Montgomery wrote to Brooke that "one good Pas de Calais port" would be sufficient to meet all the logistical needs of the 21st Army Group, but only the supply needs of the same formation. At the same time, Montgomery noted that "one good Pas de Calais port" would be insufficient for the American armies in France, which thus forced Eisenhower, if for no other reasons than logistics, to favour Montgomery's plans for an invasion of northern Germany by the 21st Army Group, whereas if Antwerp were opened up, then all of the Allied armies could be supplied. Montgomery ordered that Crerar take Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk and clear the Scheldt, a task that Crerar stated was impossible as he lacked enough troops to perform both operations at once. Montgomery refused Crerar's request to have British XII Corps under <a href="Neil%20Ritchie">Neil Ritchie</a> assigned to help clear the Scheldt as Montgomery stated he needed XII Corps for Operation Market Garden. Montgomery was able to insist that Eisenhower adopt his strategy of a single thrust to the <a href="Ruhr%20Area">Ruhr</a> with <a href="Operation%20Market%20Garden">Operation Market Garden</a> in September 1944. The offensive was strategically bold.

On 22 September 1944, General <a href="Guy%20Simonds">Guy Simonds</a>'s 2nd Canadian Corps took Boulogne, followed up by taking Calais on 1 October 1944. Montgomery was highly impatient with Simonds, complaining that it had taken Crocker's I Corps only two days to take Le Havre while it took Simonds two weeks to take Boulogne and Calais, but Simonds noted that at Le Havre, three divisions and two brigades had been employed whereas as at both Boulogne and Calais, only two brigades were sent in to take both cities. After an attempt to storm the <a href="Leopold%20Canal%20%28Belgium%29">Leopold Canal</a> by the 4th Canadian Division had been badly smashed by the German defenders, Simonds ordered a stop to further attempts to clear the river Scheldt until his mission of capturing the French ports on the English Channel had been accomplished; this allowed the German 15th Army ample time to dig into its new home on the Scheldt. The only port that was not captured by the Canadians was Dunkirk, as Montgomery ordered the 2nd Canadian Division on 15 September to hold his flank at Antwerp as a prelude for an advance up the Scheldt.

Montgomery's plan for <a href="Operation%20Market%20Garden">Operation Market Garden</a> (17–25 September 1944) was to outflank the Siegfried Line and cross the Rhine, setting the stage for later offensives into the Ruhr region. The 21st Army Group would attack north from Belgium, through the Netherlands, across the Rhine and consolidate north of Arnhem on the far side of the Rhine. The risky plan required three Airborne Divisions to capture numerous intact bridges along a single-lane road, on which an entire Corps had to attack and use as its main supply route. The offensive failed to achieve its objectives.

In the aftermath of Market Garden, Montgomery made holding the Arnhem salient his first priority, arguing that the 2nd British Army might still be able to break through and reach the wide open plains of northern Germany, and that he might be able to take the Ruhr by the end of October. In the meantime, the 1st Canadian Army, which been given the task of clearing the mouth of the river Scheldt, despite the fact that in the words of Copp and Vogel "...that Montgomery's Directive required the Canadians to continue to fight alone for almost two weeks in a battle which everyone agreed could only be won with the aid of additional divisions". For his part, Field Marshal <a href="Gerd%20von%20Rundstedt">Gerd von Rundstedt</a>, the German commander of the Western Front ordered General <a href="Gustav-Adolf%20von%20Zangen">Gustav-Adolf von Zangen</a>, the commander of 15th Army that: "The attempt of the enemy to occupy the West Scheldt in order to obtain the free use of the harbor of Antwerp must be "resisted to the utmost"" (emphasis in the original). Rundstedt argued with Hitler that as long as the Allies could not use the port of Antwerp, the Allies would lack the logistical capacity for an invasion of Germany.

Montgomery pulled away from the 1st Canadian Army (temporarily commanded now by Simonds as Crerar was ill), the British 51st Highland Division, 1st Polish Division, British 49th (West Riding) Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and sent all of these formations to help the 2nd British Army hold the Arnhem salient. However, Simonds seems to have regarded the Scheldt campaign as a test of his ability, and he felt he could clear the Scheldt with only three Canadian divisions, namely the 2nd, the 3rd, and the 4th, despite having to take on the entire 15th Army, which held strongly fortified positions in a landscape that favoured the defence. Simonds never complained about the lack of air support (made worse by the cloudy October weather), shortages of ammunition or having insufficient troops, regarding these problems as challenges for him to overcome, rather than a cause for complaint. As it was, Simonds made only slow progress in October 1944 during the fighting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Scheldt">Battle of the Scheldt</a>, although he was praised by Copp for imaginative and aggressive leadership who managed to achieve much, despite all of the odds against him. Montgomery had little respect for the Canadian generals, whom he dismissed as mediocre, except for Simonds, whom he consistently praised as Canada's only "first-rate" general in the entire war.

Admiral Ramsay, who proved to be a far more articulate and forceful champion of the Canadians than their own generals, starting on 9 October demanded of Eisenhower in a meeting that he either order Montgomery to make supporting the 1st Canadian Army in the Scheldt fighting his number one priority or sack him. Ramsay in very strong language argued to Eisenhower that the Allies could only invade Germany if Antwerp was opened, and that as long as the three Canadian divisions fighting in the Scheldt had shortages of ammunition and artillery shells because Montgomery made the Arnhem salient his first priority, then Antwerp would not be opened anytime soon. Even Brooke wrote in his diary: "I feel that Monty's strategy for once is at fault. Instead of carrying out the advance to Arnhem he ought to have made certain of Antwerp". Prompted by Ramsay, Eisenhower sent Montgomery later on 9 October 1944, a cable that emphasizing the "supreme importance of Antwerp", stating that "the Canadian Army will not, repeat not, be able to attack until November unless immediately supplied with adequate ammunition", and finally warning that the Allied advance into Germany would totally stop by mid-November unless Antwerp was opened in October. Montgomery replied by accusing Ramsay of making "wild statements" unsupported by the facts, he denied that the Canadians were having to ration ammunition, and claimed that he would soon take the Ruhr, making the Scheldt campaign a sideshow. Montgomery further issued a memo entitled "Notes on Command in Western Europe" demanding that he once again be made Land Forces Commander, which led to an exasperated Eisenhower telling Montgomery that the question was not the command arrangement, but rather his ability and willingness to obey orders, and that he either obey orders to clear the mouth of the Scheldt at once, or he would be sacked.

A chastised Montgomery told Eisenhower on 15 October 1944 that he was now making clearing the Scheldt his "top priority", and the ammunition shortages in the 1st Canadian Army, a problem which he denied even existed five days earlier, were now over as supplying the Canadians was henceforth his first concern. Simonds, now reinforced with British troops and Royal Marines, cleared the Scheldt by taking <a href="Walcheren">Walcheren</a> island, the last of the German "fortresses" on the Scheldt on 8 November 1944. With the Scheldt in Allied hands, Royal Navy minesweepers removed the German mines in the river, and Antwerp was finally opened to shipping on 28 November 1944. Reflecting Antwerp's importance, the Germans spent the winter of 1944–45 firing V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets at it in an attempt to shut down the port, and the German offensive in December 1944 in the Ardennes had as its ultimate objective the capture of Antwerp. Urban wrote that Montgomery's most "serious failure" in the entire war was not the well publicised Battle of Arnhem, but rather his lack of interest in opening up Antwerp, as without it the entire Allied advance from the North Sea to the Swiss Alps stalled in the autumn of 1944 for logistical reasons.

When the surprise attack on the Ardennes took place on 16 December 1944, starting the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>, the front of the <a href="Twelfth%20United%20States%20Army%20Group">US 12th Army Group</a> was split, with the bulk of the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army">US First Army</a> being on the northern shoulder of the German 'bulge'. The 12th Army Group commander, General <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>, was located south of the penetration at Luxembourg and command of the US First Army became problematic. Montgomery was the nearest commander on the ground and on 20 December, Eisenhower (who was in <a href="Versailles%2C%20Yvelines">Versailles</a> in France) temporarily transferred <a href="Courtney%20Hodges">Courtney Hodges</a>' US First Army and <a href="William%20Hood%20Simpson">William Simpson</a>'s <a href="Ninth%20United%20States%20Army">US Ninth Army</a> to Montgomery's 21st Army Group until the "bulge" could be reduced and a simpler line of communications restored, despite Bradley's vehement objections on national grounds. When Bradley learned that Montgomery had been given command of two American armies totalling some 200,000 men, he phoned Eisenhower to say: "I cannot be responsible to the American people if you do this. I resign!" Eisenhower sharply responded that Bradley was in fact responsible to him and "Your resignation means absolutely nothing...Well, Brad, these are my orders." Montgomery grasped the situation quickly, visiting all <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisional</a>, <a href="corps">corps</a>, and <a href="field%20army">field army</a> commanders himself and instituting his '<a href="GHQ%20Liaison%20Regiment">Phantom</a>' network of liaison officers. He grouped the <a href="XXX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British XXX Corps</a> as a strategic reserve behind the Meuse and reorganised the US defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of <a href="Sankt%20Vith">St Vith</a>. The German commander of the <a href="5th%20Panzer%20Army">5th Panzer Army</a>, <a href="Hasso%20von%20Manteuffel">Hasso von Manteuffel</a> said:

The Wehrmacht's objectives for Betrieb Wacht am Rhein (Operation Watch on the Rhine) was to split the Allied Armies in two by attacking the center of the allied armies through the Ardennes Forest in Belgium (during one of the worst storms in history) and then turning north to recapture the port at Antwerp. On the north-western side of the battle area was Montgomery's 21st Army Group which anchored the northern flank of the allied lines, with Bradley's army group on Montgomery's right flank and Patton's 3rd Army on the far right of Bradley's flank.

Since <a href="SHAEF">SHAEF</a> believed the Wehrmacht was no longer capable of launching a major offensive, nor that any offensive could be launched through such rugged terrain as the Ardennes Forest — particularly during winter — the Ardennes was used as an area to send US divisions, which had recently fought and sustained severe casualties, in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest to regroup and refit. It was also used as a place where new units recently from the US were sent to get some field experience in a "safe place".

General Patton's 3rd Army, which was to the south, switched from its mission in order to turn north and fought its way through the severe weather and German opposition and broke through to Bastogne, the bad weather cleared so that the <a href="USAAF">USAAF</a> and the RAF could resume air assault operations against <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> armored divisions and the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> ran out of petrol.

It is known that the Battle of the Bulge was the largest land battle fought by the western allies during all of World War II. This battle is possibly best summed up by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> in his speech to the House of Commons:

Montgomery's 21st Army Group (later) advanced to the Rhine with operations <a href="Operation%20Veritable">Veritable</a> and <a href="Operation%20Grenade">Grenade</a> in February 1945. A meticulously planned <a href="Operation%20Plunder">Rhine crossing</a> occurred on 24 March. While successful, it was two weeks after the Americans had unexpectedly (sans meticulous planning) <a href="Battle%20of%20Remagen">captured</a> the (railway) <a href="Ludendorff%20Bridge">Ludendorff Bridge</a> at Remagen and crossed the river on 7 March — "with less than a battalion". Montgomery's river crossing was followed by the <a href="Ruhr%20Pocket">encirclement</a> of German <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a> in the <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr</a>. Initially Montgomery's role was to guard the flank of the American advance. This was altered to forestall any chance of a <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> advance into Denmark, and the 21st Army Group occupied <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and <a href="Rostock">Rostock</a> and sealed off the Danish peninsula. On 4 May 1945, on <a href="L%C3%BCneburg%20Heath">Lüneburg Heath</a>, Montgomery accepted the <a href="German%20surrender%20at%20L%C3%BCneburg%20Heath">surrender of German forces in north-west Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands</a>.

The British high command were not concerned only with winning the war by defeating Germany, but also with ensuring that they were still considered to be a serious power after the war, able to influence global policy. Suffering heavy losses in Normandy would diminish Britain’s Imperial influence on the post-war world, and on post-war Europe in particular. Many of Montgomery’s clashes with Eisenhower were based on his determination to pursue the war “on lines most suitable to Britain.”

The fewer the number of combat-experienced divisions the British had left at the end of the war, the smaller Britain’s influence in Europe was likely to be, compared to the emerging superpowers of the USA and the USSR. Montgomery was thus caught in a dilemma – the British Army needed to be seen to be pulling at least half the weight in the liberation of Europe, but without incurring the heavy casualties that such a role would inevitably produce. The 21st Army Group scarcely possessed sufficient forces to achieve such a military prominence, and the remaining divisions had to be expended sparingly. 

Britain did not possess in 1944 the resources to rebuild shattered divisions and it was imperative for Montgomery to protect the viability of the British army so that Britain could still play an important part in the final victory. It was reported to the War Office that "Montgomery has to be very careful of what he does on his eastern flank because on that flank is the only British Army there is left in this part of the world". The context of British casualties and the shortage of reinforcements, prompted Montgomery to "excessive caution." Dempsey wrote on 13 June, that Caen could only be taken by a "set piece assault and we did not have the men or the ammunition for that at the time.

Montgomery’s solution to the dilemma was to attempt to remain Commander of All Land Forces until the end of the war, so that any victory attained – although achieved primarily by American formations – would accrue in part to him and thus to Britain. He would also be able to ensure that British units were spared some of the high-attrition actions, but would be most prominent when the final blows were struck. When that strategy failed, he persuaded Eisenhower to occasionally put some American formations under the control of the 21st Army Group, so as to bolster his resources while still maintaining the outward appearance of successful British effort. 

Montgomery initially remained prepared to push Second (British) Army hard to capture the vital strategic town of Caen, and consequently incur heavy losses. In the original Overlord plan, Montgomery was determined to push past Caen to Falaise as quickly as possible. However after the heavy casualties incurred in capturing Caen, he changed his mind. 

Montgomery was notorious for his lack of tact and diplomacy. Even his "patron," the Chief of the Imperial General Staff <a href="Alan%20Brooke%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Alanbrooke">Lord Alanbrooke</a>, frequently mentions it in his war diaries: "he is liable to commit untold errors in lack of tact" and "I had to haul him over the coals for his usual lack of tact and egotistical outlook which prevented him from appreciating other people's feelings". One incident that illustrated this occurred during the North African campaign when Montgomery bet <a href="Walter%20Bedell%20Smith">Walter Bedell Smith</a> that he could capture <a href="Sfax">Sfax</a> by the middle of April 1943. Smith jokingly replied that if Montgomery could do it he would give him a <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Flying Fortress</a> complete with crew. Smith promptly forgot all about it, but Montgomery did not, and when Sfax was taken on 10 April he sent a message to Smith "claiming his winnings". Smith tried to laugh it off, but Montgomery was having none of it and insisted on his aircraft. It got as high as <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> who, with his renowned skill in diplomacy, ensured Montgomery did get his Flying Fortress, though at a great cost in ill feeling. Even Alanbrooke thought it "crass stupidity".

In August 1945, whilst Alanbrooke, <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Sir Andrew Cunningham</a> and <a href="Charles%20Portal%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Portal%20of%20Hungerford">Sir Charles Portal</a> were discussing their possible successors as "Chiefs Of Staff", they concluded that Montgomery would be very efficient as CIGS from the Army's point of view but that he was also very unpopular with a large proportion of the Army. Despite this, Cunningham and Portal were strongly in favour of Montgomery succeeding Alanbrooke after his retirement. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, by all accounts a faithful friend, is quoted as saying of Montgomery, "In defeat, unbeatable; in victory, unbearable."

After the war Lord Montgomery became the <a href="Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> (C-in-C) of the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a> (BAOR), the name given to the British Occupation Forces, and was the British member of the Allied Control Council. Montgomery was also President of <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth Football Club</a> between 1944 and 1961. He was created 1st <a href="Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</a> in <a href="1946%20New%20Year%20Honours">1946</a>. He was <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a> (CIGS) from 1946 to 1948, succeeding Alanbrooke. As CIGS, Montgomery toured Africa in 1947 and in a secret 1948 report to <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>'s government proposed a "master plan" to exploit the raw materials of Africa, thereby counteracting the loss of British influence in Asia. Montgomery held racist views towards Africans, describing them as "complete savages" incapable of developing their own countries. He was barely on speaking terms with his fellow chiefs, sending his VCIGS to attend their meetings and he clashed particularly with <a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Tedder">Sir Arthur Tedder</a>, who was by now <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Air%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS). When Montgomery's term of office expired, Prime Minister Attlee appointed <a href="William%20Slim%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Slim">Sir William Slim</a> from retirement with the rank of <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">field marshal</a> as his successor; when Montgomery protested that he had told his protégé, General <a href="John%20Crocker">Sir John Crocker</a>, former commander of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">I Corps</a> in the 1944–45 <a href="North-West%20Europe%20Campaign">North-West Europe Campaign</a>, that the job was to be his, Attlee is said to have given the memorable retort "Untell him".

He was then appointed Chairman of the <a href="Western%20European%20Union">Western European Union</a>'s C-in-C committee. Volume 3 of <a href="Nigel%20Hamilton%20%28author%29">Nigel Hamilton</a>'s "Life of Montgomery of Alamein" gives an account of the bickering between Montgomery and his land forces chief, a French general, which created splits through the Union headquarters. He was thus pleased to become Eisenhower's deputy in creating the <a href="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</a>'s <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Powers%20Europe">European</a> forces in 1951. He would continue to serve under Eisenhower's successors, Generals <a href="Matthew%20Ridgway">Matthew Ridgway</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Gruenther">Al Gruenther</a>, until his retirement, aged nearly 71, in 1958. His mother Maud, <a href="Lady">Lady</a> Montgomery, died at New Park in <a href="Moville">Moville</a> in <a href="Inishowen">Inishowen</a> in 1949; she was buried alongside her husband in the '<a href="kirkyard">kirkyard</a>' behind St. Columb's Church, the small <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> church beside New Park, overlooking <a href="Lough%20Foyle">Lough Foyle</a>. Lord Montgomery did not attend the funeral, claiming he was "too busy".

He was chairman of the governing body of <a href="St.%20John%27s%20School%2C%20Leatherhead">St. John's School</a> in <a href="Leatherhead">Leatherhead</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, from 1951 to 1966, and a generous supporter. Lord Montgomery was an Honorary Member of the <a href="Winkle%20Club">Winkle Club</a>, a noted charity in <a href="Hastings">Hastings</a>, <a href="East%20Sussex">East Sussex</a>, and introduced <a href="Sir%20Winston%20Churchill">Sir Winston Churchill</a> to the club in 1955.

Montgomery's memoirs (1958) criticised many of his wartime comrades in harsh terms, including Eisenhower. He was threatened with legal action by Field Marshal Auchinleck for suggesting that Auchinleck had intended to retreat from the Alamein position if attacked again, and had to give a radio broadcast (20 November 1958) expressing his gratitude to Auchinleck for having stabilised the front at the First Battle of Alamein. The 1960 paperback edition of his memoirs contains a publisher's note drawing attention to that broadcast, and stating that in the publisher's view the reader might reasonably assume from Montgomery's text that Auchinleck had been planning to retreat "into the Nile Delta or beyond" and pointing out that it had been Auchinleck's intention to launch an offensive as soon as the Eighth Army was "rested and regrouped". Montgomery was stripped of his honorary citizenship of <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>, and was challenged to a duel by an Italian officer.

In retirement he publicly supported "<a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>" after a visit to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> in 1962, and after a visit to China declared himself impressed by the Chinese leadership. He spoke out against the legalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom, arguing that the <a href="Sexual%20Offences%20Act%201967">Sexual Offences Act 1967</a> was a "charter for buggery" and that "this sort of thing may be tolerated by the French, but we're British – thank God". Biographer Nigel Hamilton has suggested Montgomery may have been a repressed homosexual; in the late 1940s Montgomery maintained an affectionate friendship with a 12-year-old Swiss boy. One biographer called the friendship "bizarre", although not "improper", and a sign of "pitiful loneliness".

He twice met with <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i general <a href="Moshe%20Dayan">Moshe Dayan</a>. After an initial meeting in the early 1950s, Montgomery met Dayan again in the 1960s to discuss the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, which Dayan was studying. Montgomery was harshly critical of US strategy in Vietnam, which involved deploying large numbers of combat troops, aggressive bombing attacks, and uprooting entire village populations and forcing them into <a href="Strategic%20Hamlet%20Program">strategic hamlets</a>. Montgomery said that the Americans' most important problem was that they had no clear-cut objective, and allowed local commanders to set military policy. At the end of their meeting, Montgomery asked Dayan to tell the Americans, in his name, that they were "insane".

During a visit to the Alamein battlefields in May 1967, he bluntly told high-ranking <a href="Egyptian%20Army">Egyptian Army</a> officers that they would lose any war with Israel, a warning that was shown to be justified only a few weeks later in the <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a>.

Herman Boerhaave

Herman Boerhaave (, 31 December 1668 – 23 September 1738) was a Dutch botanist, chemist, Christian humanist, and physician of European fame. He is regarded as the founder of clinical teaching and of the modern academic hospital and is sometimes referred to as "the father of physiology," along with Venetian physician <a href="Santorio%20Santorio">Santorio Santorio</a> (1561–1636). He introduced the quantitative approach into medicine, along with his pupil <a href="Albrecht%20von%20Haller">Albrecht von Haller</a> (1708–1777). He is best known for demonstrating the relation of symptoms to lesions, and he was the first to isolate the chemical <a href="urea">urea</a> from urine. He was the first physician to put thermometer measurements to clinical practice. His motto was "Simplex sigillum veri": 'The simple is the sign of the true'. He is often hailed as the "Dutch <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>".

Boerhaave was born at <a href="Voorhout">Voorhout</a> near <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>. The son of a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> pastor, in his youth Boerhaave studied for a <a href="Divinity%20%28academic%20discipline%29">divinity</a> degree and wanted to become a preacher. After the death of his father, however, he was offered a scholarship and he entered the <a href="University%20of%20Leiden">University of Leiden</a>, where he took his degree in philosophy in 1689, with a dissertation "De distinctione mentis a corpore" (on the difference of the mind from the body). There he attacked the doctrines of <a href="Epicurus">Epicurus</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> and <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Spinoza</a>. He then turned to the study of medicine, in which he graduated in 1693 at <a href="University%20of%20Harderwijk">Harderwijk</a> in present-day <a href="Gelderland">Gelderland</a>.

In 1701 he was appointed lecturer on the institutes of medicine at Leiden; in his inaugural discourse, "De commendando <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocratis</a> studio", he recommended to his pupils that great physician as their model. In 1709 he became professor of <a href="botany">botany</a> and medicine, and in that capacity he did good service, not only to his own university, but also to botanical science, by his improvements and additions to the <a href="Hortus%20Botanicus%20Leiden">botanic garden of Leiden</a>, and by the publication of numerous works descriptive of new species of plants.

On 14 September 1710, Boerhaave married Maria Drolenvaux, the daughter of the rich merchant, Alderman Abraham Drolenvaux. They had four children, of whom one daughter, Maria Joanna, lived to adulthood. In 1722, he began to suffer from an extreme case of <a href="gout">gout</a>, recovering the next year.

In 1714, when he was appointed rector of the university, he succeeded <a href="Govert%20Bidloo">Govert Bidloo</a> in the chair of practical medicine, and in this capacity he introduced the modern system of clinical instruction. Four years later he was appointed to the chair of chemistry as well. In 1728 he was elected into the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a>, and two years later into the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> of London. In 1729 declining health obliged him to resign the chairs of chemistry and botany; and he died, after a lingering and painful illness, at Leiden.

His reputation so increased the fame of the University of Leiden, especially as a school of medicine, that it became popular with visitors from every part of Europe. All the princes of Europe sent him pupils, who found in this skilful professor not only an indefatigable teacher, but an affectionate guardian. When <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter the Great</a> went to Holland in 1716 (he was in Holland before in 1697 to instruct himself in maritime affairs), he also took lessons from Boerhaave. <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> travelled to see him, as did <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, who became a close friend. His reputation was not confined to Europe; a Chinese mandarin sent him a letter addressed to "the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe," and it reached him in due course.

The operating theatre of the University of Leiden in which he once worked as an anatomist is now at the centre of a museum named after him; the <a href="Boerhaave%20Museum">Boerhaave Museum</a>. <a href="Asteroid">Asteroid</a> <a href="8175%20Boerhaave">8175 Boerhaave</a> is named after Boerhaave. From 1955 to 1961 Boerhaave's image was printed on Dutch 20-<a href="guilder">guilder</a> banknotes. The <a href="Leiden%20University%20Medical%20Centre">Leiden University Medical Centre</a> organises medical trainings called "Boerhaave-courses".

He had a prodigious influence on the development of medicine and chemistry in Scotland. British medical schools credit Boerhaave for developing the system of medical education upon which their current institutions are based. Every founding member of the <a href="Edinburgh%20Medical%20School">Edinburgh Medical School</a> had studied at Leyden and attended Boerhaave's lectures on chemistry including <a href="John%20Rutherford%20%28physician%29">John Rutherford</a> and <a href="Francis%20Home">Francis Home</a>. Boerhaave's "Elementa Chemiae (1732)" is recognised as the first text on chemistry. 
Boerhaave first described <a href="Boerhaave%20syndrome">Boerhaave syndrome</a>, which involves tearing of the oesophagus, usually a consequence of vigorous vomiting. He notoriously described in 1724 the case of Baron Jan von Wassenaer, a Dutch admiral who died of this condition following a gluttonous feast and subsequent regurgitation. This condition was uniformly fatal prior to modern surgical techniques allowing repair of the oesophagus.

Boerhaave was critical of his <a href="Netherlands%20%28terminology%29%23Dutch">Dutch</a> contemporary, <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a>, attacking him in his dissertation in 1689. At the same time, he admired <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> and was a devout Christian who often wrote about God in his works. A collection of his religious thoughts on medicine, translated from Latin to English, has been compiled by the "Sir Thomas Browne Instituut Leiden" under the name "Boerhaaveìs Orations" (meaning "Boerhaavian Prayers"). Among other things, he considered nature as God's Creation and he used to say that the poor were his best patients because God was their paymaster.

As a credible chemist and physician of European, the human body was a very inquisitive and compelling component in agreed with other physicians of his time – like Borelli –’s mind and thus he devoted a diligent focus towards this subject matter.

Boerhaave's ideas about the human body were heavily influenced by French mathematician and philosopher <a href="Rene%20Descartes">Rene Descartes</a>. Descartes contributed much to iatromechanical theories. Another influencer of Boerhaave's reasoning was <a href="Giovanni%20Borelli">Giovanni Borelli</a>. He was a distinguished astronomer and mathematician in the 1600s and published writings on animal motions mirroring machinery principles. Inspired by this and Cartesianism, Boerhaave proposed that the human body's operations are based on a hydraulic model. In his work, he alluded to simple machines, such as levers and pulleys, as well as other mechanisms to explain parts of the body. Boerhaave described the body as made up of pipe-like structures such as are found in a machine. For example, pipes in a machine parallel the physiology of veins in the human body. Boerhaave took this mechanistic notion even further by noting the importance of a proper balance of fluid pressure. Fluids within the body should be able to move around freely, without obstacles. Similar to a machine, a well-being was self-regulating. The body must maintain these conditions to be a healthy equilibrium state. Boerhaave's view on medicine accepted this apparatus-like body philosophy and thus focused attention on materialistic problems rather than mystical explanations of illness.

Boerhaave stressed the atomically research conceived on sense experiences and scientific experiments. Boerhaave attracted many students to Leiden University, where he taught his perception and philosophy. Boerhaave's notion of the systematic body burgeoned throughout Europe and consequently aiding in the transformation of medical educations in European schools.
Boerhaave's intuition struck up a great deal of interest among other critical medical thinkers – one being <a href="Friedrich%20Hoffmann">Friedrich Hoffmann</a>, who emphasised using physico-mechanical principles to preserve and, if needed, restore health. As a professor at Leiden, Boerhaave influenced many of his students. Some of his followers conducted experiments to bolster Boerhaave's philosophy, while other physicians rejected and proposed alternative notions about the human body. Boerhaave also contributed a great number of textbooks and writings that circulated Europe. The enrichment extracted from his lectures at Leiden. In 1708, his publication of the Institutes of Medicine was issued in over five languages with approximately ten editions. "Elementa Chemia", a world-renowned chemistry textbook, was published in 1732.

Viewing the body as a mechanism deviated from the path that <a href="Galen">Galen</a> and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> previously laid down. Instead of solely relying on past finding, Boerhaave understood the importance of seeking fixed results on his own and experiencing the findings first hand. This new thinking augmented Renaissance anatomy and opened doors of novel reasoning leading up to the medical enlightenment germane to <a href="iatrochemistry">iatrochemistry</a>.

Benjamin Disraeli

Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, (21 December 1804 – 19 April 1881) was a British statesman of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> who twice served as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, as well as a novelist. He played a central role in the creation of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">modern Conservative Party</a>, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> leader <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>, and his <a href="one-nation%20conservatism">one-nation conservatism</a> or "Tory democracy". He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. He is the only UK Prime Minister to have been <a href="British%20Jews">of Jewish birth</a>.

Disraeli was born in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, then a part of <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>. His father left the <a href="Judaism">Jewish faith</a> after a dispute at his <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>; young Benjamin became an <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> at the age of 12. 

After several unsuccessful attempts, Disraeli entered the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> in 1837. In 1846 the Prime Minister at the time, <a href="Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a> split the party over his proposal to repeal the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a>; which involved ending the tariff on imported grain. Disraeli clashed with Peel in the House of Commons. Disraeli became a major figure in the party. When <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a>, the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> and <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons">Leader of the House of Commons</a>

Upon Derby's retirement in 1868, Disraeli became Prime Minister briefly before losing that year's general election. He returned to the Opposition, before leading the party to winning a majority in the 1874 general election. He maintained a close friendship with <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, who in 1876 appointed him Earl of Beaconsfield. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the <a href="Eastern%20Question">Eastern Question</a>—the slow decay of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and the desire of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the <a href="Suez%20Canal%20Company">Suez Canal Company</a> (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> to obtain peace in the Balkans at terms favourable to Britain and unfavourable to Russia, its longstanding enemy. This diplomatic victory over Russia established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen.

World events thereafter moved against the Conservatives. Controversial wars in <a href="Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Anglo-Zulu%20War">South Africa</a> undermined his public support. He angered British farmers by refusing to reinstitute the Corn Laws in response to poor harvests and cheap imported grain. With Gladstone conducting <a href="Midlothian%20campaign">a massive speaking campaign</a>, his Liberals bested Disraeli's Conservatives at <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201880">the 1880 general election</a>. In his final months, Disraeli led the Conservatives in Opposition. He had throughout his career written novels, beginning in 1826, and he published his last completed novel, "<a href="Endymion%20%28Disraeli%20novel%29">Endymion</a>", shortly before he died at the age of 76.

Disraeli was born on 21 December 1804 at 6 King's Road, Bedford Row, <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, London, the second child and eldest son of <a href="Isaac%20D%27Israeli">Isaac D'Israeli</a>, a literary critic and historian, and Maria (Miriam), "née" Basevi. The family was of <a href="Sephardic%20Jew">Sephardic Jew</a>ish Italian mercantile background. All Disraeli's grandparents and great-grandparents were born in <a href="Early%20Modern%20Italy">Italy</a>; Isaac's father, <a href="Benjamin%20D%27Israeli%20%28merchant%29">Benjamin</a>, moved to <a href="England">England</a> from <a href="Venice">Venice</a> in 1748. Disraeli later romanticised his origins, claiming that his father's family was of grand Spanish and Venetian descent; in fact Isaac's family was of no great distinction, but on Disraeli's mother's side, in which he took no interest, there were some distinguished forebears. Historians differ on Disraeli's motives for rewriting his family history: Bernard Glassman argues that it was intended to give him status comparable to that of England's ruling elite; <a href="Sarah%20Bradford">Sarah Bradford</a> believes "his dislike of the commonplace would not allow him to accept the facts of his birth as being as middle-class and undramatic as they really were".
Disraeli's siblings were Sarah (1802–1859), Naphtali (born and died 1807), Ralph (1809–1898), and James ("Jem") (1813–1868). He was close to his sister, and on affectionate but more distant terms with his surviving brothers. Details of his schooling are sketchy. From the age of about six he was a <a href="day%20pupil">day boy</a> at a <a href="dame%20school">dame school</a> in <a href="Islington">Islington</a> that one of his biographers later described as "for those days a very high-class establishment". Two years later or so—the exact date has not been ascertained—he was sent as a boarder to Rev John Potticary's <a href="St%20Piran%27s%20%28school%29">St Piran's school</a> at <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath</a>. While he was there events at the family home changed the course of Disraeli's education and of his whole life: his father renounced Judaism and had the four children baptised into the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> in July and August 1817.

Isaac D'Israeli had never taken religion very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the <a href="Bevis%20Marks%20Synagogue">Bevis Marks Synagogue</a>. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend <a href="Sharon%20Turner">Sharon Turner</a>, a solicitor, convinced him that although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.

Conversion to Christianity enabled Disraeli to contemplate a career in politics. Britain in the early-nineteenth century was not a greatly anti-Semitic society, and there had been <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">Members of Parliament</a> (MPs) from Jewish families since <a href="Sampson%20Eardley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Eardley">Samson Gideon</a> in 1770. But until 1858, MPs were required to take the oath of allegiance "on the true faith of a Christian", necessitating at least nominal conversion. It is not known whether Disraeli formed any ambition for a parliamentary career at the time of his baptism, but there is no doubt that he bitterly regretted his parents' decision not to send him to <a href="Winchester%20College">Winchester College</a>. As one of the great <a href="Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public schools</a> of England, <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a> consistently provided recruits to the political elite. His two younger brothers were sent there, and it is not clear why Isaac D'Israeli chose to send his eldest son to a much less prestigious school. The boy evidently held his mother responsible for the decision; Bradford speculates that "Benjamin's delicate health and his obviously Jewish appearance may have had something to do with it." The school chosen for him was run by <a href="Eliezer%20Cogan">Eliezer Cogan</a> at <a href="Higham%20Hill">Higham Hill</a> in <a href="Walthamstow">Walthamstow</a>. He began there in the autumn term of 1817; he later recalled his education:
In November 1821, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Disraeli was <a href="Articled%20clerk">articled</a> as a clerk to a firm of <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a>s—Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearse and Hunt—in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. T F Maples was not only the young Disraeli's employer and friend of his father's, but also his prospective father-in-law: Isaac and Maples entertained the possibility that the latter's only daughter might be a suitable match for Benjamin. A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including <a href="Robert%20Blake%2C%20Baron%20Blake">Robert Blake</a> and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to have learned a good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, "I had some scruples, for even then I dreamed of Parliament. My father's refrain always was '<a href="Philip%20Carteret%20Webb">Philip Carteret Webb</a>', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It would be a mistake to suppose that the two years and more that I was in the office of our friend were wasted. I have often thought, though I have often regretted the University, that it was much the reverse."
The year after joining Maples' firm, Benjamin changed his surname from D'Israeli to Disraeli. His reasons for doing so are unknown, but the biographer Bernard Glassman surmises that it was to avoid being confused with his father. Disraeli's sister and brothers adopted the new version of the name; Isaac and his wife retained the older form.

Disraeli toured Belgium and the <a href="Rhine">Rhine Valley</a> with his father in the summer of 1824; he later wrote that it was while travelling on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> that he decided to abandon his position: "I determined when descending those magical waters that I would not be a lawyer." On their return to England he left the solicitors, at the suggestion of Maples, with the aim of qualifying as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>. He enrolled as a student at <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a> and joined the <a href="Chambers%20%28law%29">chambers</a> of his uncle, Nathaniel Basevy, and then those of Benjamin Austen, who persuaded Isaac that Disraeli would never make a barrister and should be allowed to pursue a literary career. He had made a tentative start: in May 1824 he submitted a manuscript to his father's friend, the publisher <a href="John%20Murray%20%281778%E2%80%931843%29">John Murray</a>, but withdrew it before Murray could decide whether to publish it. Released from the law, Disraeli did some work for Murray, but turned most of his attention not to literature but to speculative dealing on the <a href="stock%20exchange">stock exchange</a>.

There was at the time a boom in shares in South American mining companies. Spain was losing its South American colonies in the face of rebellions. At the urging of <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a> the British government recognised the new independent governments of Argentina (1824), Colombia and Mexico (both 1825). With no money of his own, Disraeli borrowed money to invest. He became involved with the financier <a href="John%20Diston%20Powles">J. D. Powles</a>, who was prominent among those encouraging the mining boom. In the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies. The pamphlets were published by John Murray, who invested heavily in the boom.

Murray had for some time had ambitions to establish a new morning paper to compete with "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>". In 1825 Disraeli convinced him that he should proceed. The new paper, "<a href="The%20Representative%20%28newspaper%29">The Representative</a>", promoted the mines and those politicians who supported them, particularly Canning. Disraeli impressed Murray with his energy and commitment to the project, but he failed in his key task of persuading the eminent writer <a href="John%20Gibson%20Lockhart">John Gibson Lockhart</a> to edit the paper. After that, Disraeli's influence on Murray waned, and to his resentment he was sidelined in
the affairs of "The Representative". The paper survived for only six months, partly because the mining <a href="Stock%20market%20bubble">bubble</a> burst in late 1825, and partly because, according to Blake, the paper was "atrociously edited", and would have failed regardless.

The bursting of the mining bubble was ruinous for Disraeli. By June 1825 he and his business partners had lost £7,000. Disraeli could not pay off the last of his debts from this debacle until 1849. He turned to writing, motivated partly by his desperate need for money, and partly by a wish for revenge on Murray and others by whom he felt slighted. There was a vogue for what was called "silver-fork fiction"—novels depicting aristocratic life, usually by anonymous authors, read avidly by the aspirational middle classes. Disraeli's first novel, "<a href="Vivian%20Grey">Vivian Grey</a>", published anonymously in four volumes in 1826–27, was a thinly veiled re-telling of the affair of "The Representative". It sold well, but caused much offence in influential circles when the authorship was discovered. Disraeli, then just 23 years old, did not move in high society, as the numerous <a href="solecism">solecism</a>s in his book made obvious. Reviewers were sharply critical on these grounds of both the author and the book. Furthermore, Murray and Lockhart, men of great influence in literary circles, believed that Disraeli had caricatured them and abused their confidence—an accusation denied by the author but repeated by many of his biographers. In later editions Disraeli made many changes, softening his satire, but the damage to his reputation proved long-lasting.

Disraeli's biographer Jonathan Parry writes that the financial failure and personal criticism that Disraeli suffered in 1825 and 1826 were probably the trigger for a serious nervous crisis affecting him over the next four years: "He had always been moody, sensitive, and solitary by nature, but now became seriously depressed and lethargic." He was still living with his parents in London, but in search of the "change of air" recommended by the family's doctors Isaac took a succession of houses in the country and on the coast, before Disraeli sought wider horizons.

Together with his sister's fiancé, William Meredith, Disraeli travelled widely in southern Europe and beyond in 1830–31. The trip was financed partly by another high society novel, "The Young Duke", written in 1829–30. The tour was cut short suddenly by Meredith's death from smallpox in Cairo in July 1831. Despite this tragedy, and the need for treatment for a sexually transmitted disease on his return, Disraeli felt enriched by his experiences. He became, in Parry's words, "aware of values that seemed denied to his insular countrymen. The journey encouraged his self-consciousness, his moral relativism, and his interest in Eastern racial and religious attitudes." Blake regards the tour as one of the formative experiences of Disraeli's whole career: "[T]he impressions that it made on him were life-lasting. They conditioned his attitude toward some of the most important political problems which faced him in his later years—especially the Eastern Question; they also coloured many of his novels."

Disraeli wrote two novels in the aftermath of the tour. "<a href="Contarini%20Fleming">Contarini Fleming</a>" (1832) was avowedly a self-portrait. It is subtitled "a psychological autobiography", and depicts the conflicting elements of its hero's character: the duality of northern and Mediterranean ancestry, the dreaming artist and the bold man of action. As Parry observes, the book ends on a political note, setting out Europe's progress "from feudal to federal principles". "<a href="The%20Wondrous%20Tale%20of%20Alroy">The Wondrous Tale of Alroy</a>" the following year portrayed the problems of a medieval Jew in deciding between a small, exclusively Jewish state and a large empire embracing all.
After the two novels were published, Disraeli declared that he would "write no more about myself". He had already turned his attention to politics in 1832, during the great crisis over the <a href="Reform%20Bill%20of%201832">Reform Bill</a>. He contributed to an anti-<a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> pamphlet edited by <a href="John%20Wilson%20Croker">John Wilson Croker</a> and published by Murray entitled "England and France: or a cure for Ministerial Gallomania". The choice of a <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> publication was regarded as strange by Disraeli's friends and relatives, who thought him more of a <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radical</a>. Indeed, he had objected to Murray about Croker's inserting "high Tory" sentiment: Disraeli remarked, "it is quite impossible that anything adverse to the general measure of Reform can issue from my pen." Moreover, at the time "Gallomania" was published, Disraeli was electioneering in <a href="Wycombe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">High Wycombe</a> in the Radical interest.

Disraeli's politics at the time were influenced both by his rebellious streak and by his desire to make his mark. At that time, the politics of the nation were dominated by members of the aristocracy, together with a few powerful commoners. The Whigs derived from the coalition of Lords who had forced through the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights</a> in 1689 and in some cases were their actual descendants, not merely spiritual. The Tories tended to support King and Church, and sought to thwart political change. A small number of Radicals, generally from northern constituencies, were the strongest advocates of continuing reform. In the early-1830s the Tories and the interests they represented appeared to be a lost cause. The other great party, the Whigs, were anathema to Disraeli: "Toryism is worn out & I cannot condescend to be a Whig." There were two general elections in 1832; Disraeli unsuccessfully stood as a Radical at High Wycombe in each.

Disraeli's political views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly democratic reform of the electoral system, and also some Tory ones, including <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a>. He began to move in Tory circles. In 1834 he was introduced to the former <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="John%20Copley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lyndhurst">Lord Lyndhurst</a>, by Henrietta Sykes, wife of <a href="Sir%20Francis%20William%20Sykes%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir Francis Sykes</a>. She was having an affair with Lyndhurst, and began another with Disraeli. Disraeli and Lyndhurst took an immediate liking to each other. Lyndhurst was an indiscreet gossip with a fondness for intrigue; this appealed greatly to Disraeli, who became his secretary and go-between. In 1835 Disraeli stood for the last time as a Radical, unsuccessfully contesting High Wycombe once again.
In April 1835, Disraeli fought a <a href="by-election">by-election</a> at <a href="Taunton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Taunton</a> as a Tory candidate. The Irish MP <a href="Daniel%20O%27Connell">Daniel O'Connell</a>, misled by inaccurate press reports, thought Disraeli had slandered him while electioneering at Taunton; he launched an outspoken attack, referring to Disraeli as:
Disraeli's public exchanges with O'Connell, extensively reproduced in "The Times", included a demand for a duel with the 60-year-old O'Connell's son (which resulted in Disraeli's temporary detention by the authorities), a reference to "the inextinguishable hatred with which [he] shall pursue [O'Connell's] existence", and the accusation that O'Connell's supporters had a "princely revenue wrung from a starving race of fanatical slaves". Disraeli was highly gratified by the dispute, which propelled him to general public notice for the first time. He did not defeat the incumbent Whig member, <a href="Henry%20Labouchere%2C%201st%20Baron%20Taunton">Henry Labouchere</a>, but the Taunton constituency was regarded as unwinnable by the Tories. Disraeli kept Labouchere's majority down to 170, a good showing that put him in line for a winnable seat in the near future.

With Lyndhurst's encouragement Disraeli turned to writing propaganda for his newly adopted party. His "Vindication of the English Constitution", was published in December 1835. It was couched in the form of an open letter to Lyndhurst, and in Bradford's view encapsulates a political philosophy that Disraeli adhered to for the rest of his life. Its themes were the value of benevolent aristocratic government, a loathing of political dogma, and the modernisation of Tory policies. The following year he wrote a series of satires on politicians of the day, which he published in "The Times" under the pen-name "Runnymede". His targets included the Whigs, collectively and individually, Irish nationalists, and political corruption. One essay ended:

Disraeli was now firmly in the Tory camp. He was elected to the exclusively Tory <a href="Carlton%20Club">Carlton Club</a> in 1836, and was also taken up by the party's leading hostess, <a href="Frances%20Vane%2C%20Marchioness%20of%20Londonderry">Lady Londonderry</a>. In June 1837 <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">WilliamIV</a> died, the young <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, his niece, succeeded him, and parliament was dissolved. On the recommendation of the Carlton Club, Disraeli was adopted as a Tory parliamentary candidate at the ensuing <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201837">general election</a>.

In the election in July 1837 Disraeli won a seat in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> as one of two members, both Tory, for the constituency of <a href="Maidstone%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Maidstone</a>. The other was <a href="Wyndham%20Lewis%20%28politician%29">Wyndham Lewis</a>, who helped finance Disraeli's election campaign, and who died the following year. In the same year Disraeli published a novel, "Henrietta Temple", which was a love story and social comedy, drawing on his affair with Henrietta Sykes. He had broken off the relationship in late 1836, distraught that she had taken yet another lover. His other novel of this period is "<a href="Venetia%20%28Disraeli%20novel%29">Venetia</a>", a romance based on the characters of <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Shelley</a> and <a href="Lord%20Byron">Byron</a>, written quickly to raise much-needed money.

Disraeli made his <a href="maiden%20speech">maiden speech</a> in Parliament on 7 December 1837. He followed O'Connell, whom he sharply criticised for the latter's "long, rambling, jumbling, speech". He was shouted down by O'Connell's supporters. After this unpromising start Disraeli kept a low profile for the rest of the parliamentary session. He was a loyal supporter of the party leader <a href="Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a> and his policies, with the exception of a personal sympathy for the <a href="Chartism">Chartist</a> movement that most Tories did not share.
In 1839 Disraeli married <a href="Mary%20Anne%20Disraeli">Mary Anne Lewis</a>, the widow of Wyndham Lewis. Twelve years Disraeli's senior, Mary Lewis had a substantial income of £5,000 a year. His motives were generally assumed to be mercenary, but the couple came to cherish one another, remaining close until she died more than three decades later. "Dizzy married me for my money", his wife said later, "But, if he had the chance again, he would marry me for love."

Finding the financial demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for <a href="Shrewsbury%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Shrewsbury</a>, winning one of the constituency's two seats at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201841">1841 general election</a>, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being left on the <a href="Backbencher">back benches</a>, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.

Although a Tory (or Conservative, as some in the party now called themselves) Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the aims of Chartism, and argued for an alliance between the <a href="landed%20nobility">landed aristocracy</a> and the working class against the increasing power of the merchants and new industrialists in the middle class. After Disraeli won widespread acclaim in March 1842 for worsting the formidable <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> in debate, he was taken up by a small group of idealistic new Tory MPs, with whom he formed the <a href="Young%20England">Young England</a> group. They held that the landed interests should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by middle-class businessmen.

For many years in his parliamentary career Disraeli hoped to forge a paternalistic Tory-Radical alliance, but he was unsuccessful. Before the <a href="Reform%20Act%201867">Reform Act 1867</a>, the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with <a href="John%20Bright">John Bright</a>, a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to persuade Bright to sacrifice his distinct position for parliamentary advancement. When Disraeli attempted to secure a Tory-Radical cabinet in 1852, Bright refused.

Disraeli gradually became a sharp critic of Peel's government, often deliberately taking positions contrary to those of his nominal chief. The best known of these stances were over the <a href="Maynooth%20Grant">Maynooth Grant</a> in 1845 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. But the young MP had attacked his leader as early as 1843 on Ireland and then on foreign policy interventions. In a letter of February 1844, he slighted the Prime Minister for failing to send him a Policy Circular. He laid into the Whigs as freebooters, swindlers and conmen but Peel's own Free Trade policies were directly in the firing line.

The <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a>, <a href="William%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, resigned from the cabinet over the Maynooth Grant. The Corn Laws imposed a tariff on imported wheat, protecting British farmers from foreign competition, but making the cost of bread artificially high. Peel hoped that the repeal of the Corn Laws and the resultant influx of cheaper wheat into Britain would relieve the condition of the poor, and in particular the suffering caused by successive failure of potato crops in Ireland—the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Great Famine</a>.

The first months of 1846 were dominated by a battle in Parliament between the free traders and the protectionists over the repeal of the Corn Laws, with the latter rallying around Disraeli and <a href="Lord%20George%20Bentinck">Lord George Bentinck</a>. The landowning interest in the Party, under its leader, <a href="Sir%20William%20Miles%2C%201st%20Baronet">William Miles</a> MP for <a href="East%20Somerset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">East Somerset</a>, had called upon Disraeli to lead the Party. Disraeli had declined, though pledged support to the Country Gentlemen's Interes, as Bentink had offered to lead if he had Disraeli's support. Disraeli stated, in a letter to Sir William Miles of 11 June 1860, that he wished to help "because, from my earliest years, my sympathies had been with the landed interest of England".

An alliance of free-trade Conservatives (the "<a href="Peelites">Peelites</a>"), Radicals, and Whigs carried repeal, and the Conservative Party split: the Peelites moved towards the Whigs, while a "new" Conservative Party formed around the protectionists, led by Disraeli, Bentinck, and <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Stanley</a> (later Lord Derby).

The split in the Tory party over the repeal of the Corn Laws had profound implications for Disraeli's political career: almost every Tory politician with experience of office followed Peel, leaving the rump bereft of leadership. In Blake's words, "[Disraeli] found himself almost the only figure on his side capable of putting up the oratorical display essential for a parliamentary leader." Looking on from the House of Lords, the <a href="George%20Campbell%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">Duke of Argyll</a> wrote that Disraeli "was like a <a href="subaltern">subaltern</a> in a great battle where every superior officer was killed or wounded". If the Tory Party could muster the electoral support necessary to form a government, then Disraeli now seemed to be guaranteed high office. However, he would take office with a group of men who possessed little or no official experience, who had rarely felt moved to speak in the House of Commons, and who, as a group, remained hostile to Disraeli on a personal level. In the event the matter was not put to the test, as the Tory split soon had the party out of office, not regaining power until 1852. The Conservatives would not again have a majority in the House of Commons until 1874.

Peel successfully steered the repeal of the Corn Laws through Parliament, and was then defeated by an alliance of all his enemies on the issue of Irish law and order; he resigned in June 1846. The Tories remained split and the Queen sent for <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Russell">Lord John Russell</a>, the Whig leader. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201847">1847 general election</a>, Disraeli stood, successfully, for the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Buckinghamshire</a> constituency. The new House of Commons had more Conservative than Whig members, but the depth of the Tory schism enabled Russell to continue to govern. The Conservatives were led by Bentinck in the Commons and Stanley in the Lords.
In 1847 a small political crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from the leadership and highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party. In that year's general election, <a href="Lionel%20de%20Rothschild">Lionel de Rothschild</a> had been returned for the <a href="City%20of%20London%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">City of London</a>. As a practising Jew he could not take the oath of allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.

Disraeli spoke in favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was "completed Judaism", and asking the House of Commons "Where is your Christianity if you do not believe in their Judaism?" Russell and Disraeli's future rival Gladstone thought it brave of him to speak as he did; the speech was badly received by his own party. The Tories and the Anglican establishment were hostile to the bill. <a href="Samuel%20Wilberforce">Samuel Wilberforce</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Oxford">Bishop of Oxford</a>, spoke strongly against the measure and implied that Russell was paying off the Jews for helping elect him. With the exception of Disraeli, every member of the future protectionist cabinet then in Parliament voted against the measure. One who was not yet an MP, <a href="John%20Manners%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Rutland">Lord John Manners</a>, stood against Rothschild when the latter re-submitted himself for election in 1849. Disraeli, who had attended the Protectionists dinner at the Merchant Taylors Hall, joined Bentinck in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration. The measure was voted down.

In the aftermath of the debate Bentinck resigned the leadership and was succeeded by <a href="Charles%20Manners%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Rutland">Lord Granby</a>; Disraeli's own speech, thought by many of his own party to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being. While these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase <a href="Hughenden%20Manor">Hughenden Manor</a>, in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>. The possession of a country house, and incumbency of a county constituency were regarded as essential for a Tory with ambitions to lead the party. Disraeli and his wife alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London for the rest of their marriage. The negotiations were complicated by Bentinck's sudden death on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of £25,000 from Bentinck's brothers <a href="Lord%20Henry%20Bentinck">Lord Henry Bentinck</a> and <a href="William%20Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck%2C%205th%20Duke%20of%20Portland">Lord Titchfield</a>.

Within a month of his appointment Granby resigned the leadership in the Commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without a leader in the Commons for the rest of the parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and <a href="John%20Charles%20Herries">John Charles Herries</a>—indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted him. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.

In March 1851, Lord John Russell's <a href="Whig%20government%2C%201846%E2%80%931852">government</a> was defeated over a bill to equalise the county and borough franchises, mostly because of divisions among his supporters. He resigned, and the Queen sent for Stanley, who felt that a minority government could do little and would not last long, so Russell remained in office. Disraeli regretted this, hoping for an opportunity, however brief, to show himself capable in office. Stanley, on the other hand, deprecated his inexperienced followers as a reason for not assuming office, "These are not names I can put before the Queen."

At the end of June 1851, Stanley's father died, and he succeeded to his title as <a href="Earl%20of%20Derby">Earl of Derby</a>. The Whigs were wracked by internal dissensions during the second half of 1851, much of which Parliament spent in recess. Russell dismissed <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> from the cabinet, leaving the latter determined to deprive the Prime Minister of office as well. Palmerston did so within weeks of Parliament's reassembly on 4 February 1852, his followers combining with Disraeli's Tories to defeat the government on a Militia Bill, and Russell resigned. Derby had either to take office or risk damage to his reputation and he accepted the Queen's commission as Prime Minister. Palmerston declined any office; Derby had hoped to have him as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>. Disraeli, his closest ally, was his second choice and accepted, though disclaiming any great knowledge in the financial field. Gladstone refused to join the government. Disraeli may have been attracted to the office by the £5,000 per year salary, which would help pay his debts. Few of the new cabinet had held office before; when Derby tried to inform the <a href="Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> of the names of the Queen's new ministers, the old Duke, who was somewhat deaf, inadvertently branded the new government by incredulously repeating "Who? Who?"

In the following weeks, Disraeli served as Leader of the House (with Derby as Prime Minister in the Lords) and as Chancellor. He wrote regular reports on proceedings in the Commons to Victoria, who described them as "very curious" and "much in the style of his books". Parliament was <a href="Legislative%20session%23Procedure%20in%20Commonwealth%20realms">prorogued</a> on 1 July 1852 as the Tories could not govern for long as a minority; Disraeli hoped that they would gain a majority of about 40. Instead, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201852">the election</a> later that month had no clear winner, and the Derby government held to power pending the meeting of Parliament.

Disraeli's task as Chancellor was to devise a budget which would satisfy the protectionist elements who supported the Tories, without uniting the free-traders against it. His proposed budget, which he presented to the Commons on 3 December, lowered the taxes on malt and tea, provisions designed to appeal to the working class. To make his budget revenue-neutral, as funds were needed to provide defences against the French, he doubled the house tax and continued the income tax. Disraeli's overall purpose was to enact policies which would benefit the working classes, making his party more attractive to them. Although the budget did not contain protectionist features, the opposition was prepared to destroy it—and Disraeli's career as Chancellor—in part out of revenge for his actions against Peel in 1846. MP <a href="Sidney%20Herbert%2C%201st%20Baron%20Herbert%20of%20Lea">Sidney Herbert</a> predicted that the budget would fail because "Jews make no converts".
Disraeli delivered the budget on 3 December 1852, and prepared to wind up the debate for the government on 16 December—it was customary for the Chancellor to have the last word. A massive defeat for the government was predicted. Disraeli attacked his opponents individually, and then as a force, "I face a Coalition ... This, too, I know, that England does not love coalitions." His speech of three hours was quickly seen as a parliamentary masterpiece. As MPs prepared to divide, Gladstone rose to his feet and began an angry speech, despite the efforts of Tory MPs to shout him down. The interruptions were fewer, as Gladstone gained control of the House, and in the next two hours painted a picture of Disraeli as frivolous and his budget as subversive. The government was defeated by 19 votes, and Derby resigned four days later. He was replaced by the Peelite <a href="George%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Aberdeen">Earl of Aberdeen</a>, with Gladstone as his Chancellor. Because of Disraeli's unpopularity among the Peelites, no party reconciliation was possible while he remained Tory leader in the House of Commons.

With the fall of the government, Disraeli and the Conservatives returned to the opposition benches. Disraeli would spend three-quarters of his 44-year parliamentary career in opposition. Derby was reluctant to seek to unseat the government, fearing a repetition of the Who? Who? Ministry and knowing that despite his lieutenant's strengths, shared dislike of Disraeli was part of what had formed the governing coalition. Disraeli, on the other hand, was anxious to return to office. In the interim, Disraeli, as Conservative leader in the Commons, opposed the government on all major measures.

In June 1853 Disraeli was awarded an honorary degree by <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a>. He had been recommended for it by Lord Derby, the university's <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Oxford%20University">Chancellor</a>. The start of the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> in 1854 caused a lull in party politics; Disraeli spoke patriotically in support. The British military efforts were marked by bungling, and in 1855 a restive Parliament considered a resolution to establish a committee on the conduct of the war. The Aberdeen government chose to make this a <a href="motion%20of%20confidence">motion of confidence</a>; Disraeli led the opposition to defeat the government, 305 to 148. Aberdeen resigned, and the Queen sent for Derby, who to Disraeli's frustration refused to take office. Palmerston was deemed essential to any Whig ministry, and he would not join any he did not head. The Queen reluctantly asked Palmerston to form a government. Under Palmerston, the war went better, and was ended by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281856%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in early 1856. Disraeli was early to call for peace, but had little influence on events.

When <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">a rebellion</a> broke out in India in 1857, Disraeli took a keen interest in affairs, having been a member of a <a href="select%20committee">select committee</a> in 1852 which considered how best to rule the subcontinent, and had proposed eliminating the governing role of the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a>. After peace was restored, and Palmerston in early 1858 brought in legislation for direct rule of India by the Crown, Disraeli opposed it. Many Conservative MPs refused to follow him and the bill passed the Commons easily.

Palmerston's grip on the premiership was weakened by his response to the <a href="Orsini%20affair">Orsini affair</a>, in which an attempt was made to assassinate the French Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> by an Italian revolutionary with a bomb made in Birmingham. At the request of the French ambassador, Palmerston put forward amendments to the <a href="conspiracy%20to%20murder">conspiracy to murder</a> statute, proposing to make creating an <a href="bomb">infernal device</a> a felony rather than a misdemeanour. He was defeated by 19 votes on the second reading, with many Liberals crossing the aisle against him. He immediately resigned, and Lord Derby returned to office.

Derby took office at the head of a purely "Conservative" administration, not in coalition with any other faction. He again offered a place to Gladstone, who declined. Disraeli was once more leader of the House of Commons and returned to the Exchequer. As in 1852, Derby led a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a>, dependent on the division of its opponents for survival. As Leader of the House, Disraeli resumed his regular reports to Queen Victoria, who had requested that he include what she "could not meet in newspapers".

During its brief life of just over a year, the Derby government proved moderately progressive. The <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%201858">Government of India Act 1858</a> ended the role of the East India Company in governing the subcontinent. It also passed the Thames Purification Bill, which funded the construction of much larger sewers for London. Disraeli had supported efforts <a href="Emancipation%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">to allow Jews to sit in Parliament</a>—the oaths required of new members could only be made in good faith by a Christian. Disraeli had a bill passed through the Commons allowing each house of Parliament to determine what oaths its members should take. This was grudgingly agreed to by the House of Lords, with a minority of Conservatives joining with the opposition to pass it. In 1858, Baron Lionel de Rothschild became the first MP to profess the Jewish faith.

Faced with a vacancy, Disraeli and Derby tried yet again to bring Gladstone, still nominally a Conservative MP, into the government, hoping to strengthen it. Disraeli wrote a personal letter to Gladstone, asking him to place the good of the party above personal animosity: "Every man performs his office, and there is a Power, greater than ourselves, that disposes of all this." In responding to Disraeli, Gladstone denied that personal feelings played any role in his decisions then and previously whether to accept office, while acknowledging that there were differences between him and Derby "broader than you may have supposed".

The Tories pursued a Reform Bill in 1859, which would have resulted in a modest increase to the franchise. The Liberals were healing the breaches between those who favoured Russell and the Palmerston loyalists, and in late March 1859, the government was defeated on a Russell-sponsored amendment. Derby dissolved Parliament, and the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201859">ensuing general election</a> resulted in modest Tory gains, but not enough to control the Commons. When Parliament assembled, Derby's government was defeated by 13 votes on an amendment to the <a href="speech%20from%20the%20throne">Address from the Throne</a>. He resigned, and the Queen reluctantly sent for Palmerston again.

After Derby's second ejection from office, Disraeli faced dissension within Conservative ranks from those who blamed him for the defeat, or who felt he was disloyal to Derby—the former Prime Minister warned Disraeli of some MPs seeking his removal from the front bench. Among the conspirators were <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Robert Cecil</a>, a young Conservative MP who would a quarter century later become Prime Minister as Lord Salisbury; he wrote that having Disraeli as leader in the Commons decreased the Conservatives' chance of holding office. When <a href="James%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Cecil's father</a> objected, Lord Robert stated, "I have merely put into print what all the country gentlemen were saying in private."
Disraeli led a toothless opposition in the Commons—seeing no way of unseating Palmerston, Derby had privately agreed not to seek the government's defeat. Disraeli kept himself informed on foreign affairs, and on what was going on in cabinet, thanks to a source within it. When the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> began in 1861, Disraeli said little publicly, but <a href="United%20Kingdom%20and%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">like most Englishmen</a> expected the South to win. Less reticent were Palmerston, Gladstone (again Chancellor) and Russell, whose statements in support of the South contributed to years of hard feelings in the United States. In 1862, Disraeli met Prussian Count <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> for the first time and said of him, "be careful about that man, he means what he says".

The party truce ended in 1864, with Tories outraged over Palmerston's handling of the territorial dispute between the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> and Denmark known as the <a href="Schleswig-Holstein%20Question">Schleswig-Holstein Question</a>. Disraeli had little help from Derby, who was ill, but he united the party enough on a no-confidence vote to limit the government to a majority of 18—Tory defections and absentees kept Palmerston in office. Despite rumours about Palmerston's health as he passed his eightieth birthday, he remained personally popular, and the Liberals increased their margin in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201865">July 1865 general election</a>. In the wake of the poor election results, Derby predicted to Disraeli that neither of them would ever hold office again.

Political plans were thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865. Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone clearly the Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent. One of Russell's early priorities was a Reform Bill, but the proposed legislation that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party. The Conservatives and the <a href="Adullamites">dissident Liberals</a> repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June. The dissidents were unwilling to serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor. In 1867, the Conservatives introduced a Reform Bill. Without a majority in the Commons, the Conservatives had little choice but to accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone.

The <a href="Reform%20Act%201867">Reform Act 1867</a> passed that August, extending the franchise by 938,427—an increase of 88%—by giving the vote to male householders and male lodgers paying at least £10 for rooms. It eliminated <a href="rotten%20borough">rotten borough</a>s with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, and granted constituencies to 15 unrepresented towns, with extra representation to large municipalities such as Liverpool and Manchester. This act was unpopular with the right wing of the Conservative Party, most notably <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Cranborne</a> (as Robert Cecil was by then known), who resigned from the government and spoke against the bill, accusing Disraeli of "a political betrayal which has no parallel in our Parliamentary annals". Cranborne, however, was unable to lead an effective rebellion against Derby and Disraeli. Disraeli gained wide acclaim and became a hero to his party for the "marvellous parliamentary skill" with which he secured the passage of Reform in the Commons.

Derby had long suffered from attacks of <a href="gout">gout</a> which sent him to his bed, unable to deal with politics. As the new session of Parliament approached in February 1868, he was bedridden at his home, <a href="Knowsley%20Hall">Knowsley Hall</a>, near Liverpool. He was reluctant to resign, reasoning that he was only 68, much younger than either Palmerston or Russell at the end of their premierships. Derby knew that his "attacks of illness would, at no distant period, incapacitate me from the discharge of my public duties"; doctors had warned him that his health required his resignation from office. In late February, with Parliament in session and Derby absent, he wrote to Disraeli asking for confirmation that "you will not shrink from the additional heavy responsibility". Reassured, he wrote to the Queen, resigning and recommending Disraeli as "only he could command the cordial support, en masse, of his present colleagues". Disraeli went to <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, where the Queen asked him to form a government. The monarch wrote to her daughter, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Prussian Crown Princess Victoria</a>, "Mr. Disraeli is Prime Minister! A proud thing for a man 'risen from the people' to have obtained!" The new Prime Minister told those who came to congratulate him, "I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole."

The Conservatives remained a minority in the House of Commons and the passage of the Reform Bill required the calling of a new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraeli's term as Prime Minister, which began in February 1868, would therefore be short unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced <a href="Frederic%20Thesiger%2C%201st%20Baron%20Chelmsford">Lord Chelmsford</a> as <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> with <a href="Hugh%20Cairns%2C%201st%20Earl%20Cairns">Lord Cairns</a>, and brought in <a href="George%20Ward%20Hunt">George Ward Hunt</a> as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Derby had intended to replace Chelmsford once a vacancy in a suitable sinecure developed. Disraeli was unwilling to wait, and Cairns, in his view, was a far stronger minister.

Disraeli's first premiership was dominated by the heated debate over the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>. Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the <a href="established%20church">established church</a> and was funded by direct taxation, which was greatly resented by the Catholic majority. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with <a href="Henry%20Edward%20Manning">Archbishop Manning</a> the establishment of a Roman Catholic university in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal united the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberals</a> under Gladstone's leadership, while causing divisions among the Conservatives.

The Conservatives remained in office because the new electoral register was not yet ready; neither party wished a poll under the old roll. Gladstone began using the Liberal majority in the House of Commons to push through resolutions and legislation. Disraeli's government survived until the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201868">December general election</a>, at which the Liberals were returned to power with a majority of about 110.

Despite its short life, the first Disraeli government succeeded in passing a number of pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the <a href="Corrupt%20Practices%20Act%201868">Corrupt Practices Act</a> did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised an early version of <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a>, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful <a href="1868%20Expedition%20to%20Abyssinia">expedition</a> against <a href="Tewodros%20II">Tewodros II</a> of Ethiopia under <a href="Robert%20Napier%2C%201st%20Baron%20Napier%20of%20Magdala">Sir Robert Napier</a>.

With Gladstone's Liberal majority dominant in the Commons, Disraeli could do little but protest as the government advanced legislation. Accordingly, he chose to await Liberal mistakes. Having leisure time as he was not in office, he wrote a new novel, "<a href="Lothair%20%28novel%29">Lothair</a>" (1870). A work of fiction by a former Prime Minister was a new thing for Britain, and the book became a best seller.

By 1872 there was dissent in the Conservative ranks over the failure to challenge Gladstone and his Liberals. This was quieted as Disraeli took steps to assert his leadership of the party, and as divisions among the Liberals became clear. Public support for Disraeli was shown by cheering at a thanksgiving service in 1872 on the recovery of <a href="Edward%20VII">the Prince of Wales</a> from illness, while Gladstone was met with silence. Disraeli had supported the efforts of party manager <a href="John%20Eldon%20Gorst">John Eldon Gorst</a> to put the administration of the Conservative Party on a modern basis. On Gorst's advice, Disraeli gave a speech to a mass meeting in Manchester that year. To roaring approval, he compared the Liberal front bench to "a range of exhausted volcanoes. Not a flame flickers on a single pallid crest. But the situation is still dangerous. There are occasional earthquakes and ever and again the dark rumbling of the sea." Gladstone, Disraeli stated, dominated the scene and "alternated between a menace and a sigh".

At his first departure from <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a> in 1868, Disraeli had had Victoria create Mary Anne Viscountess of Beaconsfield in her own right in lieu of a peerage for himself. Through 1872 the eighty-year-old peeress was suffering from stomach cancer. She died on 15 December. Urged by a clergyman to turn her thoughts to Jesus Christ in her final days, she said she could not: "You know Dizzy is my J.C." After she died, Gladstone, who always had a liking for Mary Anne, sent her widower a letter of condolence.

In 1873, Gladstone brought forward legislation to establish a Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions as to whether he had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.

In January 1874, Gladstone called a general election, convinced that if he waited longer, he would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme of the past five years. As the constituencies voted, it became clear that the result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish <a href="Home%20Rule%20League">Home Rule League</a>. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.

Disraeli's cabinet of twelve, with six peers and six commoners, was the smallest since <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform</a>. Of the peers, five of them had been in Disraeli's 1868 cabinet; the sixth, Lord Salisbury, was reconciled to Disraeli after negotiation and became <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20India">Secretary of State for India</a>. Lord Stanley (who had succeeded his father, the former Prime Minister, as Earl of Derby) became Foreign Secretary and <a href="Stafford%20Northcote%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Iddesleigh">Sir Stafford Northcote</a> the Chancellor.

In August 1876, Disraeli was elevated to the House of Lords as <a href="Earl%20of%20Beaconsfield">Earl of Beaconsfield</a> and Viscount Hughenden. The Queen had offered to ennoble him as early as 1868; he had then declined. She did so again in 1874, when he fell ill at <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral</a>, but he was reluctant to leave the Commons for a house in which he had no experience. Continued ill health during his second premiership caused him to contemplate resignation, but his lieutenant, Derby, was unwilling, feeling that he could not manage the Queen. For Disraeli, the Lords, where the debate was less intense, was the alternative to resignation from office. Five days before the end of the 1876 session of Parliament, on 11 August, Disraeli was seen to linger and look around the chamber before departing the Commons. Newspapers reported his ennoblement the following morning.

In addition to the viscounty bestowed on Mary Anne Disraeli; the earldom of Beaconsfield was to have been bestowed on <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> in 1797, but he had died before receiving it. The name <a href="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a>, a town near Hughenden, also was given to a minor character in "Vivian Grey". Disraeli made various statements about his elevation, writing to Selina, Lady Bradford on 8 August 1876, "I am quite tired of that place [the Commons]" but when asked by a friend how he liked the Lords, replied, "I am dead; dead but in the Elysian fields."

Under the stewardship of <a href="Richard%20Assheton%20Cross">Richard Assheton Cross</a>, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, Disraeli's new government enacted many reforms, including the <a href="Artisans%27%20and%20Labourers%27%20Dwellings%20Improvement%20Act%201875">Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875</a>, which made inexpensive loans available to towns and cities to construct working-class housing. Also enacted were the <a href="Public%20Health%20Act%201875">Public Health Act 1875</a>, modernising sanitary codes through the nation, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876).

Disraeli's government also introduced a new <a href="Factory%20Act">Factory Act</a> meant to protect workers, the <a href="Conspiracy%2C%20and%20Protection%20of%20Property%20Act%201875">Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875</a>, which allowed peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As a result of these social reforms the <a href="Liberal-Labour%20%28UK%29">Liberal-Labour</a> MP <a href="Alexander%20Macdonald%20%28Lib%E2%80%93Lab%20politician%29">Alexander Macdonald</a> told his constituents in 1879, "The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty."

Gladstone in 1870 had sponsored an <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a>, introducing <a href="competitive%20examination">competitive examination</a> into <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Civil%20Service">the Civil Service</a>, diminishing the political aspects of government hiring. Disraeli did not agree, and while he did not seek to reverse the order, his actions often frustrated its intent. For example, Disraeli made political appointments to positions previously given to career civil servants. In this, he was backed by his party, hungry for office and its emoluments after almost thirty years with only brief spells in government. Disraeli gave positions to hard-up Conservative leaders, even—to Gladstone's outrage—creating one office at £2,000 per year. Nevertheless, Disraeli made fewer peers (only 22, and one of those one of Victoria's sons) than had Gladstone—the Liberal leader had arranged for the bestowal of 37 peerages during his just over five years in office.

As he had in government posts, Disraeli rewarded old friends with clerical positions, making <a href="Sydney%20Turner">Sydney Turner</a>, son of a good friend of Isaac D'Israeli, <a href="Dean%20of%20Ripon">Dean of Ripon</a>. He favoured <a href="Low%20church">Low church</a> clergymen in promotion, disliking other movements in Anglicanism for political reasons. In this, he came into disagreement with the Queen, who out of loyalty to her late husband, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Albert, Prince Consort</a>, preferred <a href="Broad%20church">Broad church</a> teachings. One controversial appointment had occurred shortly before the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201868">1868 election</a>. When the position of <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> fell vacant, Disraeli reluctantly agreed to the Queen's preferred candidate, <a href="Archibald%20Tait">Archibald Tait</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. To fill Tait's vacant see, Disraeli was urged by many people to appoint <a href="Samuel%20Wilberforce">Samuel Wilberforce</a>, the former <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and leading figure in London society. Disraeli disliked Wilberforce and instead appointed <a href="John%20Jackson%20%28bishop%29">John Jackson</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>. Blake suggested that, on balance, these appointments cost Disraeli more votes than they gained him.

Disraeli always considered foreign affairs to be the most critical and most interesting part of statesmanship. Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas about foreign policy when he took office in 1874. He had rarely travelled abroad; since his youthful tour of the Middle East in 1830–1831, he had left Britain only for his honeymoon and three visits to Paris, the last of which was in 1856. As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe. His brief first premiership, and the first year of his second, gave him little opportunity to make his mark in foreign affairs.

The <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>, opened in 1869, cut weeks and thousands of miles off the journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, though some of the stock belonged to <a href="Isma%27il%20Pasha">Isma'il Pasha</a>, the <a href="Khedive%20of%20Egypt">Khedive of Egypt</a>, who was noted for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Lesseps">Ferdinand de Lesseps</a>, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention. The Khedive governed Egypt under the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the <a href="Eastern%20Question">Eastern Question</a> of what to do about the decaying empire governed from <a href="Istanbul">Constantinople</a>. With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had done its best to prop up the Ottomans against the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean. The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria. Britain had had the opportunity to purchase shares in the canal but had declined to do so.

Disraeli had passed near Suez in his tour of the Middle East in his youth, and on taking office, recognising the British interest in the canal as a gateway to India, he sent the Liberal MP <a href="Nathan%20Rothschild%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rothschild">Nathan Rothschild</a> to Paris to enquire about buying de Lesseps's shares. On 14 November 1875, the editor of the "<a href="Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">Pall Mall Gazette</a>", <a href="Frederick%20Greenwood">Frederick Greenwood</a>, learned from London banker Henry Oppenheim that the Khedive was seeking to sell his shares in the <a href="Suez%20Canal%20Company">Suez Canal Company</a> to a French firm. Greenwood quickly told Lord Derby, the Foreign Secretary, who notified Disraeli. The Prime Minister moved immediately to secure the shares. On 23 November, the Khedive offered to sell the shares for 100,000,000 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a>. Rather than seek the aid of the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a>, Disraeli asked Lionel de Rothschild to loan funds. Rothschild did so and controversially took a commission on the deal. The banker's capital was at risk as Parliament could have refused to ratify the transaction. The contract for purchase was signed at Cairo on 25 November and the shares deposited at the British consulate the following day.

Disraeli told the Queen, "it is settled; you have it, madam!" The public saw the venture as a daring British statement of its dominance of the seas. <a href="Ian%20Malcolm%20%28politician%29">Sir Ian Malcolm</a> described the Suez Canal share purchase as "the greatest romance of Mr. Disraeli's romantic career". In the following decades, the security of the Suez Canal, as the pathway to India, became a major focus of British foreign policy. A later Foreign Secretary, <a href="Lord%20Curzon">Lord Curzon</a>, described the canal in 1909 as "the determining influence of every considerable movement of British power to the east and south of the Mediterranean".

Although initially curious about Disraeli when he entered Parliament in 1837, Victoria came to detest him over his treatment of Peel. Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her. He told <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a>, "Everybody likes flattery; and, when you come to royalty, you should lay it on with a trowel". Disraeli's biographer, <a href="Adam%20Kirsch">Adam Kirsch</a>, suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen should be addressed by a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch. By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer to her than any of her Prime Ministers except her first, <a href="Lord%20Melbourne">Lord Melbourne</a>. When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to <a href="kiss%20hands">kiss hands</a>, he did so literally, on one knee; and, according to Richard Aldous in his book on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, "for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage."

Victoria had long wished to have an imperial title, reflecting Britain's expanding domain. She was irked when Czar <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II</a> held a higher rank than her as an emperor, and was appalled that her daughter, the Prussian Crown Princess, would outrank her when <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">her husband</a> came to the throne. She also saw an imperial title as proclaiming Britain's increased stature in the world. The title "<a href="Empress%20of%20India">Empress of India</a>" had been used informally with respect to Victoria for some time and she wished to have that title formally bestowed on her. The Queen prevailed upon Disraeli to introduce a Royal Titles Bill, and also told of her intent to <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">open Parliament</a> in person, which during this time she did only when she wanted something from legislators. Disraeli was cautious in response, as careful soundings of MPs brought a negative reaction, and declined to place such a proposal in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Speech">Queen's Speech</a>.

Once the desired bill was prepared, Disraeli's handling of it was not adept. He neglected to notify either the Prince of Wales or the opposition, and was met by irritation from the prince and a full-scale attack from the Liberals. An old enemy of Disraeli, former Liberal Chancellor <a href="Robert%20Lowe">Robert Lowe</a>, alleged during the debate in the Commons that two previous Prime Ministers had refused to introduce such legislation for the Queen. Gladstone immediately stated that he was not one of them, and the Queen gave Disraeli leave to quote her saying she had never approached a Prime Minister with such a proposal. According to Blake, Disraeli "in a brilliant oration of withering invective proceeded to destroy Lowe", who apologised and never held office again. Disraeli said of Lowe that he was the only person in London with whom he would not shake hands and, "he is in the mud and there I leave him."

Fearful of losing, Disraeli was reluctant to bring the bill to a vote in the Commons, but when he eventually did, it passed with a majority of 75. Once the bill was formally enacted, Victoria began signing her letters "Victoria R & I" ("Regina et Imperatrix", that is, Queen and Empress). According to Aldous, "the unpopular <a href="Royal%20Titles%20Act%201876">Royal Titles Act</a>, however, shattered Disraeli's authority in the House of Commons".

In July 1875 Serb populations in <a href="Bosnia">Bosnia</a> and <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>, then provinces of the Ottoman Empire, rose <a href="Herzegovina%20Uprising%20%281875%E2%80%9377%29">in revolt</a> against their Turkish masters, alleging religious persecution and poor administration. The following January, Sultan <a href="Abd%C3%BClaziz">Abdülaziz</a> agreed to reforms proposed by Hungarian statesman <a href="Julius%20Andr%C3%A1ssy">Julius Andrássy</a>, but the rebels, suspecting they might win their freedom, continued their uprising, joined by militants in Serbia <a href="April%20Uprising">and Bulgaria</a>. The Turks suppressed the Bulgarian uprising harshly, and when reports of these actions escaped, Disraeli and Derby stated in Parliament that they did not believe them. Disraeli called them "coffee-house babble" and dismissed allegations of torture by the Ottomans since "Oriental people usually terminate their connections with culprits in a more expeditious fashion".

Gladstone, who had left the Liberal leadership and retired from public life, was appalled by reports of <a href="Batak%20massacre">atrocities in Bulgaria</a>, and in August 1876, penned a hastily written pamphlet arguing that the Turks should be deprived of Bulgaria because of what they had done there. He sent a copy to Disraeli, who called it "vindictive and ill-written ... of all the Bulgarian horrors perhaps the greatest". Gladstone's pamphlet became an immense best-seller and rallied the Liberals to urge that the Ottoman Empire should no longer be a British ally. Disraeli wrote to Lord Salisbury on 3 September, "Had it not been for these unhappy 'atrocities', we should have settled a peace very honourable to England and satisfactory to Europe. Now we are obliged to work from a new point of departure, and dictate to Turkey, who has forfeited all sympathy." In spite of this, Disraeli's policy favoured Constantinople and the territorial integrity of its empire.
Disraeli and the cabinet sent Salisbury as lead British representative to the <a href="Constantinople%20Conference">Constantinople Conference</a>, which met in December 1876 and January 1877. In advance of the conference, Disraeli sent Salisbury private word to seek British military occupation of Bulgaria and Bosnia, and British control of the <a href="Ottoman%20Army">Ottoman Army</a>. Salisbury ignored these instructions, which his biographer, <a href="Andrew%20Roberts%20%28historian%29">Andrew Roberts</a> deemed "ludicrous". Nevertheless, the conference failed to reach agreement with the Turks.

Parliament opened in February 1877, with Disraeli now in the Lords as Earl of Beaconsfield. He spoke only once there in the 1877 session on the Eastern Question, stating on 20 February that there was a need for stability in the Balkans, and that forcing Turkey into territorial concessions would do nothing to secure it. The Prime Minister wanted a deal with the Ottomans whereby Britain would temporarily occupy strategic areas to deter the Russians from war, to be returned on the signing of a peace treaty, but found little support in his cabinet, which favoured partition of the Ottoman Empire. As Disraeli, by then in poor health, continued to battle within the cabinet, Russia invaded Turkey on 21 April, beginning the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%9378%29">Russo-Turkish War</a>.

The Russians pushed through Ottoman territory and by December 1877 had captured the strategic Bulgarian town of <a href="Pleven">Plevna</a>; their march on Constantinople seemed inevitable. The war divided the British, but the Russian success caused some to forget the atrocities and call for intervention on the Turkish side. Others hoped for further Russian successes. The fall of Plevna was a major story for weeks in the newspapers, and Disraeli's warnings that Russia was a threat to British interests in the eastern Mediterranean were deemed prophetic. The <a href="jingoism">jingoistic</a> attitude of many Britons increased Disraeli's political support, and the Queen acted to help him as well, showing her favour by visiting him at Hughenden—the first time she had visited the country home of her Prime Minister since <a href="Second%20Melbourne%20ministry">the Melbourne ministry</a>. At the end of January 1878, the Ottoman Sultan appealed to Britain to save Constantinople. Amid war fever in Britain, the government asked Parliament to vote £6,000,000 to prepare the <a href="British%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Navy</a> for war. Gladstone, who had involved himself again in politics, opposed the measure, but less than half his party voted with him. Popular opinion was with Disraeli, though some thought him too soft for not immediately declaring war on Russia.
With the Russians close to Constantinople, the Turks yielded and in March 1878, signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a>, <a href="Liberation%20of%20Bulgaria">conceding a Bulgarian state</a> which would cover a large part of the Balkans. It would be initially Russian-occupied and many feared that it would give them a <a href="client%20state">client state</a> close to Constantinople. Other Ottoman possessions in Europe would become independent; additional territory was to be ceded directly to Russia. This was unacceptable to the British, who protested, hoping to get the Russians to agree to attend an international conference which German Chancellor Bismarck proposed to hold at Berlin. The cabinet discussed Disraeli's proposal to position Indian troops at Malta for possible transit to the Balkans and call out reserves. Derby resigned in protest, and Disraeli appointed Salisbury as Foreign Secretary. Amid British preparations for war, the Russians and Turks agreed to discussions at Berlin.

In advance of the meeting, confidential negotiations took place between Britain and Russia in April and May 1878. The Russians were willing to make changes to the big Bulgaria, but were determined to retain their new possessions, <a href="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a> in Europe and <a href="Batum">Batum</a> and <a href="Kars">Kars</a> on the east coast of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. To counterbalance this, Britain required a possession in the Eastern Mediterranean where it might base ships and troops, and negotiated with the Ottomans for the cession of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Once this was secretly agreed, Disraeli was prepared to allow Russia's territorial gains.
The <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> was held in June and July 1878, the central relationship in it that between Disraeli and Bismarck. In later years, the German chancellor would show visitors to his office three pictures on the wall: "the portrait of my Sovereign, there on the right that of my wife, and on the left, there, that of Lord Beaconsfield". Disraeli caused an uproar in the congress by making his opening address in English, rather than in French, hitherto accepted as the international language of diplomacy. By one account, the British ambassador in Berlin, <a href="Odo%20Russell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ampthill">Lord Odo Russell</a>, hoping to spare the delegates Disraeli's awful French accent, told Disraeli that the congress was hoping to hear a speech in the English tongue by one of its masters.

Disraeli left much of the detailed work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as difficult as possible for the broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite. Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the <a href="Cyprus%20Convention">Cyprus Convention</a> ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.

Disraeli gained agreement that Turkey should retain enough of its European possessions to safeguard the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>. By one account, when met with Russian intransigence, Disraeli told his secretary to order a special train to return them home to begin the war. Although Russia yielded, Czar Alexander II later described the congress as "a European coalition against Russia, under Bismarck".

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%20%281878%29">Treaty of Berlin</a> was signed on 13 July 1878 at the <a href="Reich%20Chancellery">Radziwill Palace</a> in Berlin. Disraeli and Salisbury returned home to heroes' receptions at Dover and in London. At the door of <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>, Disraeli received flowers sent by the Queen. There, he told the gathered crowd, "Lord Salisbury and I have brought you back peace—but a peace I hope with honour." The Queen offered him a dukedom, which he declined, though accepting <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">the Garter</a>, as long as Salisbury also received it. In Berlin, word spread of Bismarck's admiring description of Disraeli, ""Der alte Jude, das ist der Mann!" "

In the weeks after Berlin, Disraeli and the cabinet considered calling a general election to capitalise on the public applause he and Salisbury had received. Parliaments were then for a seven-year term, and it was the custom not to go to the country until the sixth year unless forced to by events. Only four and a half years had passed since the last general election. Additionally, they did not see any clouds on the horizon that might forecast Conservative defeat if they waited. This decision not to seek re-election has often been cited as a great mistake by Disraeli. Blake, however, pointed out that results in local elections had been moving against the Conservatives, and doubted if Disraeli missed any great opportunity by waiting.

As successful invasions of India generally came through Afghanistan, the British had observed and sometimes intervened there since the 1830s, hoping to keep the Russians out. In 1878 the Russians sent a mission to Kabul; it was not rejected by the Afghans, as the British had hoped. The British then proposed to send their own mission, insisting that the Russians be sent away. The <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy</a>, <a href="Robert%20Bulwer-Lytton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lytton">Lord Lytton</a>, concealed his plans to issue this ultimatum from Disraeli, and when the Prime Minister insisted he take no action, went ahead anyway. When the Afghans made no answer, the British advanced against them in the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Second Anglo-Afghan War</a>, and under <a href="Frederick%20Roberts%2C%201st%20Earl%20Roberts">Lord Roberts</a> easily defeated them. The British installed a new ruler, and left a mission and garrison in Kabul.

British policy in South Africa was to encourage federation between the British-run <a href="Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a> and <a href="Colony%20of%20Natal">Natal</a>, and the <a href="Boer">Boer</a> republics, the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a> (annexed by Britain in 1877) and the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a>. The governor of Cape Colony, <a href="Bartle%20Frere">Sir Bartle Frere</a>, believing that the federation could not be accomplished until the native tribes acknowledged British rule, made demands on the <a href="Zulu%20people">Zulu</a> and their king, <a href="Cetewayo">Cetewayo</a>, which they were certain to reject. As Zulu troops could not marry until they had washed their spears in blood, they were eager for combat. Frere did not send word to the cabinet of what he had done until the ultimatum was about to expire. Disraeli and the cabinet reluctantly backed him, and in early January 1879 resolved to send reinforcements. Before they could arrive, on 22 January, a Zulu "<a href="impi">impi</a>", or army, moving with great speed and stealth, ambushed and destroyed a British encampment in South Africa in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Isandlwana">Battle of Isandlwana</a>. Over a thousand British and colonial troops were killed. Word of the defeat did not reach London until 12 February. Disraeli wrote the next day, "the terrible disaster has shaken me to the centre". He reprimanded Frere, but left him in charge, attracting fire from all sides. Disraeli sent General <a href="Garnet%20Wolseley%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Wolseley">Sir Garnet Wolseley</a> as High Commissioner and Commander in Chief, and Cetewayo and the Zulus were crushed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ulundi">Battle of Ulundi</a> on 4 July 1879.

On 8 September 1879 <a href="Pierre%20Louis%20Napoleon%20Cavagnari">Sir Louis Cavagnari</a>, in charge of the mission in Kabul, was killed with his entire staff by rebelling Afghan soldiers. Roberts undertook a successful punitive expedition against the Afghans over the next six weeks.

Gladstone, in the 1874 election, had been returned for <a href="Greenwich%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Greenwich</a>, finishing second behind a Conservative in the two-member constituency, a result he termed more like a defeat than a victory. In December 1878, he was offered the Liberal nomination at the next election for <a href="Edinburghshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Edinburghshire</a>, a constituency popularly known as Midlothian. The small Scottish electorate was dominated by two noblemen, the Conservative <a href="Walter%20Montagu%20Douglas%20Scott%2C%205th%20Duke%20of%20Buccleuch">Duke of Buccleuch</a> and the Liberal <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Earl of Rosebery</a>. The Earl, a friend of both Disraeli and Gladstone who would succeed the latter after his final term as Prime Minister, had journeyed to the United States to view politics there, and was convinced that aspects of American electioneering could be translated to the United Kingdom. On his advice, Gladstone accepted the offer in January 1879, and later that year began his <a href="Midlothian%20campaign">Midlothian campaign</a>, speaking not only in Edinburgh, but across Britain, attacking Disraeli, to huge crowds.

Conservative chances of re-election were damaged by the poor weather, and consequent effects on agriculture. Four consecutive wet summers through 1879 had led to poor harvests in the United Kingdom. In the past, the farmer had the consolation of higher prices at such times, but with bumper crops cheaply transported from the United States, grain prices remained low. Other European nations, faced with similar circumstances, opted for protection, and Disraeli was urged to reinstitute the Corn Laws. He declined, stating that he regarded the matter as settled. Protection would have been highly unpopular among the newly enfranchised urban working classes, as it would raise their cost of living. Amid an economic slump generally, the Conservatives lost support among farmers.

Disraeli's health continued to fail through 1879. Owing to his infirmities, Disraeli was three-quarters of an hour late for the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London%23Role">Lord Mayor's Dinner</a> at the <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall</a> in November, at which it is customary that the Prime Minister speaks. Though many commented on how healthy he looked, it took him great effort to appear so, and when he told the audience he expected to speak to the dinner again the following year, attendees chuckled—Gladstone was then in the midst of his campaign. Despite his public confidence, Disraeli recognised that the Conservatives would probably lose the next election, and was already contemplating his <a href="Prime%20Minister%27s%20Resignation%20Honours">Resignation Honours</a>.

Despite this pessimism, Conservatives hopes were buoyed in early 1880 with successes in by-elections the Liberals had expected to win, concluding with victory in <a href="Southwark%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Southwark</a>, normally a Liberal stronghold. The cabinet had resolved to wait before dissolving Parliament; in early March they reconsidered, agreeing to go to the country as soon as possible. Parliament was dissolved on 24 March; the first borough constituencies began voting a week later.

Disraeli took no public part in the electioneering, it being deemed improper for peers to make speeches to influence Commons elections. This meant that the chief Conservatives—Disraeli, Salisbury, and India Secretary <a href="Gathorne%20Gathorne-Hardy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cranbrook">Lord Cranbrook</a>—would not be heard from. The election was thought likely to be close. Once returns began to be announced, it became clear that the Conservatives were being decisively beaten. The final result gave the Liberals an absolute majority of about 50.

Disraeli refused to cast blame for the defeat, which he understood was likely to be final for him. He wrote to Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, <a href="Montagu%20Corry%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rowton">Montagu Corry</a>, who became Baron Rowton.
Returning to Hughenden, Disraeli brooded over his electoral dismissal, but also resumed work on "<a href="Endymion%20%28Disraeli%20novel%29">Endymion</a>", which he had begun in 1872 and laid aside before the 1874 election. The work was rapidly completed and published by November 1880. He carried on a correspondence with Victoria, with letters passed through intermediaries. When Parliament met in January 1881, he served as Conservative leader in the Lords, attempting to serve as a moderating influence on Gladstone's legislation.

Suffering from asthma and gout, Disraeli went out as little as possible, fearing more serious episodes of illness. In March, he fell ill with bronchitis, and emerged from bed only for a meeting with Salisbury and other Conservative leaders on the 26th. As it became clear that this might be his final sickness, friends and opponents alike came to call. Disraeli declined a visit from the Queen, saying, "She would only ask me to take a message to Albert." Almost blind, when he received the last letter from Victoria of which he was aware on 5 April, he held it momentarily, then had it read to him by <a href="George%20Barrington%2C%207th%20Viscount%20Barrington">Lord Barrington</a>, a <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Councillor</a>. One card, signed "A Workman", delighted its recipient, "Don't die yet, we can't do without you."

Despite the gravity of Disraeli's condition, the doctors concocted optimistic bulletins, for public consumption. The Prime Minister, Gladstone, called several times to enquire about his rival's condition, and wrote in his diary, "May the Almighty be near his pillow." There was intense public interest in the former Prime Minister's struggles for life. Disraeli had customarily taken the <a href="Anglican%20sacraments">sacrament</a> at Easter; when this day was observed on 17 April, there was discussion among his friends and family if he should be given the opportunity, but those against, fearing that he would lose hope, prevailed. On the morning of the following day, Easter Monday, he became incoherent, then comatose. Disraeli's last confirmed words before dying in the early morning of 19 April were "I had rather live but I am not afraid to die". The anniversary of Disraeli's death is now commemorated in the United Kingdom as <a href="Primrose%20Day">Primrose Day</a>.

Disraeli's executors decided against a public procession and funeral, fearing that too large crowds would gather to do him honour. The chief mourners at the service at Hughenden on 26 April were his brother Ralph and nephew Coningsby, to whom Hughenden would eventually pass. Queen Victoria was prostrated with grief, and considered ennobling Ralph or Coningsby as a memorial to Disraeli (without children, his titles became extinct with his death) but decided against it on the ground that their means were too small for a peerage. Protocol forbade her attending Disraeli's funeral (this would not be changed until 1965, when <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> attended the rites for the former Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Sir Winston Churchill</a>) but she sent <a href="Primrose%20Day">primroses</a> ("his favourite flowers") to the funeral, and visited the burial vault to place a wreath of china blooms four days later.

Disraeli is buried with his wife in a vault beneath the <a href="St%20Michael%20and%20All%20Angels%20Church%2C%20Hughenden">Church of St Michael and All Angels</a> which stands in the grounds of his home, Hughenden Manor, accessed from the churchyard. There is also a memorial to him in the chancel in the church, erected in his honour by Queen Victoria. His <a href="literary%20executor">literary executor</a> was his private secretary, Lord Rowton. The Disraeli vault also contains the body of <a href="Sarah%20Brydges%20Willyams">Sarah Brydges Willyams</a>, the wife of James Brydges Willyams of <a href="St%20Mawgan">St Mawgan</a> in Cornwall. Disraeli carried on a long correspondence with Mrs. Willyams, writing frankly about political affairs. At her death in 1865, she left him a large legacy, which helped clear up his debts. His will was proved at £84,000.

Disraeli has a memorial in <a href="Burials%20and%20memorials%20in%20Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. This monument was erected by the nation on the motion of Gladstone in his memorial speech on Disraeli in the House of Commons. Gladstone had absented himself from the funeral, with his plea of the press of public business met with public mockery. His speech was widely anticipated, if only because his dislike for Disraeli was well known, and caused the Prime Minister much worry. In the event, the speech was a model of its kind, in which he avoided comment on Disraeli's politics, while praising his personal qualities.

Disraeli's literary and political career interacted over his lifetime and fascinated Victorian Britain, making him "one of the most eminent figures in Victorian public life", and occasioned a large output of commentary. Critic <a href="Shane%20Leslie">Shane Leslie</a> noted three decades after his death that "Disraeli's career was a romance such as no Eastern vizier or Western plutocrat could tell. He began as a pioneer in dress and an aesthete of words... Disraeli actually made his novels come true."

Blake comments that Disraeli "produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further he wrote a discourse on political theory and a political biography, the "Life of Lord George Bentinck", which is excellent ... remarkably fair and accurate." But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged. They have from the outset divided critical opinion. The writer R. W. Stewart observed that there have always been two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels—one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, "It is after all, even if you are a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, no matter how much you deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one."

Disraeli's early "silver fork" novels "Vivian Grey" (1826) and "The Young Duke" (1831) featured romanticised depictions of aristocratic life (despite his ignorance of it) with character sketches of well-known public figures lightly disguised. In some of his early fiction Disraeli also portrayed himself and what he felt to be his Byronic dual nature: the poet and the man of action. His most autobiographical novel was "Contarini Fleming" (1832), an avowedly serious work that did not sell well. The critic William Kuhn suggests that Disraeli's fiction can be read as "the memoirs he never wrote", revealing the inner life of a politician for whom the norms of Victorian public life appeared to represent a social straitjacket—particularly with regard to what Kuhn sees as the author's "ambiguous sexuality".

Of the other novels of the early 1830s, "Alroy" is described by Blake as "profitable but unreadable", and "The Rise of Iskander" (1833), "The Infernal Marriage" and "Ixion in Heaven" (1834) made little impact. "Henrietta Temple" (1837) was Disraeli's next major success. It draws on the events of his affair with Henrietta Sykes to tell the story of a debt-ridden young man torn between a mercenary loveless marriage and a passionate love-at-first-sight for the eponymous heroine. "Venetia" (1837) was a minor work, written to raise much-needed cash.

In the 1840s Disraeli wrote a trilogy of novels with political themes. With "Coningsby; or, The New Generation" (1844), Disraeli, in Blake's view, "infused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing the belief that England's future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians." "Coningsby" was followed by "Sybil; or, The Two Nations" (1845), another <a href="political%20fiction">political novel</a>, which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than "Coningsby"; the "two nations" of its sub-title referred to the huge economic and social gap between the privileged few and the deprived working classes. The last in Disraeli's political novel trilogy was "Tancred; or, The New Crusade" (1847), promoting the Church of England's role in reviving Britain's flagging spirituality.

Disraeli's last completed novels were "Lothair" (1870) and "Endymion" (1880). The first, described by <a href="Daniel%20R.%20Schwarz">Daniel R Schwarz</a> as "Disraeli's ideological "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Progress">Pilgrim's Progress</a>"", is a story of political life with particular regard to the roles of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. "Endymion", despite having a Whig as hero, is a last exposition of the author's economic policies and political beliefs. Disraeli continued to the last to pillory his enemies in barely disguised caricatures: the character St Barbe in "Endymion" is widely seen as a parody of <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">Thackeray</a>, who had offended Disraeli more than thirty years earlier by lampooning him in "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" as "Codlingsby". Disraeli left an unfinished novel in which the priggish central character, Falconet, is unmistakably a caricature of Gladstone.

In the years after Disraeli's death, as Salisbury began his reign of more than twenty years over the Conservatives, the party emphasised the late leader's "<a href="One%20nation%20conservatism">One Nation</a>" views, that the Conservatives at root shared the beliefs of the working classes, with the Liberals the party of the urban élite. Disraeli had, for example, stressed the need to improve the lot of the urban labourer. The memory of Disraeli was used by the Conservatives to appeal to the working classes, with whom he was said to have had a rapport. This aspect of his policies has been re-evaluated by historians in the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1972 BHAbbott stressed that it was not Disraeli but <a href="Lord%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lord Randolph Churchill</a> who invented the term "Tory democracy", though it was Disraeli who made it an essential part of Conservative policy and philosophy. In 2007 Parry wrote, "The tory democrat myth did not survive detailed scrutiny by professional historical writing of the 1960s [which] demonstrated that Disraeli had very little interest in a programme of social legislation and was very flexible in handling parliamentary reform in 1867." Despite this, Parry sees Disraeli, rather than Peel, as the founder of the modern Conservative party. The Conservative politician and writer <a href="Douglas%20Hurd">Douglas Hurd</a> wrote in 2013, "[Disraeli] was not a one-nation Conservative—and this was not simply because he never used the phrase. He rejected the concept in its entirety."

Disraeli's enthusiastic propagation of the British Empire has also been seen as appealing to working class voters. Before his leadership of the Conservative Party, imperialism was the province of the Liberals, most notably Palmerston, with the Conservatives murmuring dissent across the aisle. Disraeli made the Conservatives the party that most loudly supported both the Empire and military action to assert its primacy. This came about in part because Disraeli's own views stemmed that way, in part because he saw advantage for the Conservatives, and partially in reaction against Gladstone, who disliked the expense of empire. Blake argued that Disraeli's imperialism "decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during the last quarter of the century than anything else". Some historians have commented on a romantic impulse behind Disraeli's approach to Empire and foreign affairs: Abbott writes, "To the mystical Tory concepts of Throne, Church, Aristocracy and People, Disraeli added Empire." Others have identified a strongly pragmatic aspect to his policies. Gladstone's biographer <a href="Philip%20Magnus-Allcroft">Philip Magnus</a> contrasted Disraeli's grasp of foreign affairs with that of Gladstone, who "never understood that high moral principles, in their application to foreign policy, are more often destructive of political stability than motives of national self-interest." In Parry's view, Disraeli's foreign policy "can be seen as a gigantic castle in the air (as it was by Gladstone), or as an overdue attempt to force the British commercial classes to awaken to the realities of European politics."

During his lifetime Disraeli's opponents, and sometimes even his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 at the time of Young England, wrote, "could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he said, I should be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?" Blake (writing in 1966) suggested that it is no more possible to answer that question now than it was then. Nevertheless, <a href="Paul%20Smith%20%28historian%29">Paul Smith</a>, in his journal article on Disraeli's politics, argues that Disraeli's ideas were coherently argued over a political career of nearly half a century, and "it is impossible to sweep them aside as a mere bag of burglar's tools for effecting felonious entry to the British political pantheon."
<a href="Stanley%20Weintraub">Stanley Weintraub</a>, in his biography of Disraeli, points out that his subject did much to advance Britain towards the 20th century, carrying one of the two great Reform Acts of the 19th despite the opposition of his Liberal rival, Gladstone. "He helped preserve constitutional monarchy by drawing the Queen out of mourning into a new symbolic national role and created the climate for what became '<a href="One-nation%20conservatism">Tory democracy</a>'. He articulated an imperial role for Britain that would last into World War II and brought an intermittently self-isolated Britain into the concert of Europe."

Frances Walsh comments on Disraeli's multifaceted public life:
The debate about his place in the Conservative pantheon has continued since his death. Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; he was seen by many, including some members of his own party, as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman. His singular and complex personality has provided historians and biographers with a particularly stiff challenge.

Historical writers have often played Disraeli and Gladstone against each other as great rivals. Roland Quinault, however, cautions us not to exaggerate the confrontation:they were not direct antagonists for most of their political careers. Indeed initially they were both loyal to the Tory party, the Church and the landed interest. Although their paths diverged over the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 and later over fiscal policy more generally, it was not until the later 1860s that their differences over parliamentary reform, Irish and Church policy assumed great partisan significance. Even then their personal relations remained fairly cordial until their dispute over the Eastern Question in the later 1870s.

Historian Michael Diamond reports that for British music hall patrons in the 1880s and 1890s, "xenophobia and pride in empire" were reflected in the halls' most popular political heroes: all were Conservatives and Disraeli stood out above all, even decades after his death, while Gladstone was used as a villain. Film historian Roy Armes has argued that historical films helped maintain the political status quo in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s by imposing an establishment viewpoint that emphasized the greatness of monarchy, empire, and tradition. The films created "a facsimile world where existing values were invariably validated by events in the film and where all discord could be turned into harmony by an acceptance of the status quo." Steven Fielding has argued that Disraeli was an especially popular film hero: "historical dramas favoured Disraeli over Gladstone and, more substantively, promulgated an essentially deferential view of democratic leadership." Stage and screen actor <a href="George%20Arliss">George Arliss</a> was known for his portrayals of Disraeli, winning the Oscar as best actor for 1929's "<a href="Disraeli%20%281929%20film%29">Disraeli</a>". Fielding says Arliss "personified the kind of paternalistic, kindly, homely statesmanship that appealed to a significant proportion of the cinema audience...Even workers attending Labour party meetings deferred to leaders with an elevated social background who showed they cared.".

In <a href="probability%20theory">probability theory</a> and <a href="statistics">statistics</a>, the binomial distribution with parameters "n" and "p" is the <a href="discrete%20probability%20distribution">discrete probability distribution</a> of the number of successes in a sequence of "n" <a href="statistical%20independence">independent</a> <a href="experiment%20%28probability%20theory%29">experiment</a>s, each asking a <a href="yes%E2%80%93no%20question">yes–no question</a>, and each with its own <a href="boolean-valued%20function">boolean</a>-valued <a href="outcome%20%28probability%29">outcome</a>: a <a href="random%20variable">random variable</a> containing single <a href="bit">bit</a> of information: <a href="wikt%3Asuccess">success</a>/<a href="yes%20and%20no">yes</a>/<a href="truth">true</a>/<a href="one">one</a> (with <a href="probability">probability</a> "p") or <a href="failure">failure</a>/no/<a href="false%20%28logic%29">false</a>/<a href="zero">zero</a> (with <a href="probability">probability</a> "q" = 1 − "p"). 
A single success/failure experiment is also called a <a href="Bernoulli%20trial">Bernoulli trial</a> or Bernoulli experiment and a sequence of outcomes is called a <a href="Bernoulli%20process">Bernoulli process</a>; for a single trial, i.e., "n" = 1, the binomial distribution is a <a href="Bernoulli%20distribution">Bernoulli distribution</a>. The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular <a href="binomial%20test">binomial test</a> of <a href="statistical%20significance">statistical significance</a>.

The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size "n" drawn <a href="Sampling%20%28statistics%29%23Replacement%20of%20selected%20units">with replacement</a> from a population of size "N." If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a <a href="hypergeometric%20distribution">hypergeometric distribution</a>, not a binomial one. However, for "N" much larger than "n", the binomial distribution remains a good approximation, and is widely used.

In general, if the random variable "X" follows the binomial distribution with parameters "n" ∈ ℕ and "p" ∈ [0,1], we write "X" ~ B("n", "p"). The probability of getting exactly "k" successes in "n" trials is given by the <a href="probability%20mass%20function">probability mass function</a>:

for "k" = 0, 1, 2, ..., "n", where

is the <a href="binomial%20coefficient">binomial coefficient</a>, hence the name of the distribution. The formula can be understood as follows. "k" successes occur with probability "p" and "n" − "k" failures occur with probability (1 − "p"). However, the "k" successes can occur anywhere among the "n" trials, and there are formula_10different ways of distributing "k" successes in a sequence of "n" trials.

In creating reference tables for binomial distribution probability, usually the table is filled in up to "n"/2 values. This is because for "k" > "n"/2, the probability can be calculated by its complement as

The <a href="Common%20reference%20string%20model">probability</a> mass function satisfies the following <a href="recurrence%20relation">recurrence relation</a>, for every formula_12:

Looking at the expression "ƒ"("k", "n", "p") as a function of "k", there is a "k" value that maximizes it. This "k" value can be found by calculating
and comparing it to 1. There is always an integer "M" that satisfies

"ƒ"("k", "n", "p") is monotone increasing for "k" < "M" and monotone decreasing for "k" > "M", with the exception of the case where ("n" + 1)"p" is an integer. In this case, there are two values for which "ƒ" is maximal: ("n" + 1)"p" and ("n" + 1)"p" − 1. "M" is the "most probable" ("most likely") outcome of the Bernoulli trials and is called the <a href="Mode%20%28statistics%29">mode</a>. Note that the probability of it occurring can be fairly small.

The <a href="cumulative%20distribution%20function">cumulative distribution function</a> can be expressed as:

where formula_17 is the "floor" under "k", i.e. the <a href="greatest%20integer">greatest integer</a> less than or equal to "k".

It can also be represented in terms of the <a href="regularized%20incomplete%20beta%20function">regularized incomplete beta function</a>, as follows:

Some closed-form bounds for the cumulative distribution function are given <a href="%23Tail%20bounds">below</a>.

Suppose a <a href="fair%20coin">biased coin</a> comes up heads with probability 0.3 when tossed. What is the probability of achieving 0, 1..., 6 heads after six tosses?

If "X" ~ "B"("n", "p"), that is, "X" is a binomially distributed random variable, n being the total number of experiments and p the probability of each experiment yielding a successful result, then the <a href="expected%20value">expected value</a> of "X" is:

For example, if "n" = 100, and "p" =1/4, then the average number of successful results will be 25.

Proof: We calculate the mean, "μ", directly calculated from its definition 

and the <a href="binomial%20theorem">binomial theorem</a>:

It is also possible to deduce the mean from the equation formula_29 whereby all formula_30 are <a href="Bernoulli%20distribution">Bernoulli distributed</a> random variables with formula_31. We get

The <a href="variance">variance</a> is:

Proof: Let formula_29 where all formula_30 are independently Bernoulli distributed random variables. Since formula_36, we get:

Usually the <a href="mode%20%28statistics%29">mode</a> of a binomial "B"("n", "p") distribution is equal to formula_38, where formula_39 is the <a href="floor%20function">floor function</a>. However, when ("n" + 1)"p" is an integer and "p" is neither 0 nor 1, then the distribution has two modes: ("n" + 1)"p" and ("n" + 1)"p" − 1. When "p" is equal to 0 or 1, the mode will be 0 and "n" correspondingly. These cases can be summarized as follows:

Proof: Let 

For formula_42 only formula_43 has a nonzero value with formula_44. For formula_45 we find formula_46 and formula_47 for formula_48. This proves that the mode is 0 for formula_42 and formula_7 for formula_45.

Let formula_52. We find 

From this follows

So when formula_55 is an integer, then formula_55 and formula_57 is a mode. In the case that formula_58, then only formula_59 is a mode.

In general, there is no single formula to find the <a href="median">median</a> for a binomial distribution, and it may even be non-unique. However several special results have been established:

If two binomially distributed random variables "X" and "Y" are observed together, estimating their covariance can be useful. The <a href="covariance">covariance</a> is

In the case "n" = 1 (the case of <a href="Bernoulli%20trial">Bernoulli trial</a>s) "XY" is non-zero only when both "X" and "Y" are one, and "μ" and "μ" are equal to the two probabilities. Defining "p" as the probability of both happening at the same time, this gives

and for "n" independent pairwise trials

If "X" and "Y" are the same variable, this reduces to the variance formula given above.

If "X" ~ B("n", "p") and "Y" ~ B("m", "p") are independent binomial variables with the same probability "p", then "X" + "Y" is again a binomial variable; its distribution is "Z=X+Y" ~ B("n+m", "p"):

However, if "X" and "Y" do not have the same probability "p", then the variance of the sum will be <a href="Binomial%20sum%20variance%20inequality">smaller than the variance of a binomial variable</a> distributed as formula_64

This result was first derived by Katz et al in 1978.

Let p and p be the probabilities of success in the binomial distributions B(X,n) and B(Y,m) respectively. Let T = (X/n)/(Y/m). 

Then log(T) is approximately normally distributed with mean log(p/p) and variance (1/x) - (1/n) + (1/y) - (1/m).

No closed form for this distribution is known. An asymptotic approximation for the mean is known.

formula_65

where "E"[] is the expectation operator, "X" is a random variable, "O"() and "o"() are the big and little <a href="Big%20O%20notation">o order function</a>s, "n" is the sample size, "p" is the probability of success and "a" is a variable that may be positive or negative, integer or fractional.

If "X" ~ B("n", "p") and, conditional on "X", "Y" ~ B("X", "q"), then "Y" is a simple binomial variable with distribution "Y" ~ B("n", "pq").

For example, imagine throwing "n" balls to a basket "U" and taking the balls that hit and throwing them to another basket "U". If "p" is the probability to hit "U" then "X" ~ B("n", "p") is the number of balls that hit "U". If "q" is the probability to hit "U" then the number of balls that hit "U" is "Y" ~ B("X", "q") and therefore "Y" ~ B("n", "pq").

The <a href="Bernoulli%20distribution">Bernoulli distribution</a> is a special case of the binomial distribution, where "n" = 1. Symbolically, "X" ~ B(1, "p") has the same meaning as "X" ~ B("p"). Conversely, any binomial distribution, B("n", "p"), is the distribution of the sum of "n" <a href="Bernoulli%20trials">Bernoulli trials</a>, B("p"), each with the same probability "p".

The binomial distribution is a special case of the <a href="Poisson%20binomial%20distribution">Poisson binomial distribution</a>, or <a href="general%20binomial%20distribution">general binomial distribution</a>, which is the distribution of a sum of "n" independent non-identical <a href="Bernoulli%20trials">Bernoulli trials</a> B("p").

If "n" is large enough, then the skew of the distribution is not too great. In this case a reasonable approximation to B("n", "p") is given by the <a href="normal%20distribution">normal distribution</a>

and this basic approximation can be improved in a simple way by using a suitable <a href="continuity%20correction">continuity correction</a>.
The basic approximation generally improves as "n" increases (at least 20) and is better when "p" is not near to 0 or 1. Various <a href="Rule%20of%20thumb">rules of thumb</a> may be used to decide whether "n" is large enough, and "p" is far enough from the extremes of zero or one:


The following is an example of applying a <a href="continuity%20correction">continuity correction</a>. Suppose one wishes to calculate Pr("X" ≤ 8) for a binomial random variable "X". If "Y" has a distribution given by the normal approximation, then Pr("X" ≤ 8) is approximated by Pr("Y" ≤ 8.5). The addition of 0.5 is the continuity correction; the uncorrected normal approximation gives considerably less accurate results.

This approximation, known as <a href="de%20Moivre%E2%80%93Laplace%20theorem">de Moivre–Laplace theorem</a>, is a huge time-saver when undertaking calculations by hand (exact calculations with large "n" are very onerous); historically, it was the first use of the normal distribution, introduced in <a href="Abraham%20de%20Moivre">Abraham de Moivre</a>'s book "<a href="The%20Doctrine%20of%20Chances">The Doctrine of Chances</a>" in 1738. Nowadays, it can be seen as a consequence of the <a href="central%20limit%20theorem">central limit theorem</a> since B("n", "p") is a sum of "n" independent, identically distributed <a href="Bernoulli%20distribution">Bernoulli variables</a> with parameter "p". This fact is the basis of a <a href="hypothesis%20test">hypothesis test</a>, a "proportion z-test", for the value of "p" using "x/n", the sample proportion and estimator of "p", in a <a href="common%20test%20statistics">common test statistic</a>.

For example, suppose one randomly samples "n" people out of a large population and ask them whether they agree with a certain statement. The proportion of people who agree will of course depend on the sample. If groups of "n" people were sampled repeatedly and truly randomly, the proportions would follow an approximate normal distribution with mean equal to the true proportion "p" of agreement in the population and with standard deviation formula_72

The binomial distribution converges towards the <a href="Poisson%20distribution">Poisson distribution</a> as the number of trials goes to infinity while the product "np" remains fixed or at least "p" tends to zero. Therefore, the Poisson distribution with parameter "λ" = "np" can be used as an approximation to B("n", "p") of the binomial distribution if "n" is sufficiently large and "p" is sufficiently small. According to two rules of thumb, this approximation is good if "n" ≥ 20 and "p" ≤ 0.05, or if "n" ≥ 100 and "np" ≤ 10.

Concerning the accuracy of Poisson approximation, see Novak, ch. 4, and references therein.


<a href="Beta%20distribution">Beta distribution</a>s provide a family of <a href="prior%20distribution">prior probability distribution</a>s for binomial distributions in <a href="Bayesian%20inference">Bayesian inference</a>:

Even for quite large values of "n", the actual distribution of the mean is significantly nonnormal. Because of this problem several methods to estimate confidence intervals have been proposed.

In the equations for confidence intervals below, the variables have the following meaning:


The notation in the formula below differs from the previous formula's in two respects:



formula_91

The exact (<a href="Binomial%20proportion%20confidence%20interval%23Clopper-Pearson%20interval">Clopper-Pearson</a>) method is the most conservative. 

The Wald method, although commonly recommended in textbooks, is the most biased.

Methods for <a href="random%20number%20generation">random number generation</a> where the <a href="marginal%20distribution">marginal distribution</a> is a binomial distribution are well-established.

One way to generate random samples from a binomial distribution is to use an inversion algorithm. To do so, one must calculate the probability that P(X=k) for all values "k" from 0 through "n". (These probabilities should sum to a value close to one, in order to encompass the entire sample space.) Then by using a <a href="pseudorandom%20number%20generator">pseudorandom number generator</a> to generate samples uniformly between 0 and 1, one can transform the calculated samples U[0,1] into discrete numbers by using the probabilities calculated in step one.

For "k" ≤ "np", <a href="Chernoff%20bound">upper bounds</a> for the lower tail of the distribution function can be derived. Recall that formula_92, the probability that there are at most "k" successes.

<a href="Hoeffding%27s%20inequality">Hoeffding's inequality</a> yields the bound

and <a href="Chernoff%27s%20inequality">Chernoff's inequality</a> can be used to derive the bound

Moreover, these bounds are reasonably tight when "p = 1/2", since the following expression holds for all "k" ≥ "3n/8"

However, the bounds do not work well for extreme values of "p". In particular, as "p" formula_96 "1", value "F(k;n,p)" goes to zero (for fixed "k", "n" with "k<n")
while the upper bound above goes to a positive constant. In this case a better bound is given by

Asymptotically, this bound is reasonably tight; see

Both these bounds are derived directly from the <a href="Chernoff%20bound">Chernoff bound</a>.
It can also be shown that,

This is proved using the method of types (see for example chapter 12 of Elements of Information Theory by Cover and Thomas ).

We can also change the formula_100 in the denominator to formula_101, by approximating the binomial coefficient with Stirlings formula.

This distribution was derived by <a href="James%20Bernoulli">James Bernoulli</a> in 1713. He considered the case where p = r/(r+s) where p is the probability of sucess and r and s are positive integers. <a href="Blaise%20Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> had earlier considered the case where p = 1/2.

Biostatistics

Biostatistics is the application of <a href="statistics">statistics</a> to a wide range of topics in <a href="biology">biology</a>. It encompasses the design of biological <a href="experiment">experiment</a>s, especially in <a href="medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="pharmacy">pharmacy</a>, <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> and <a href="fisheries">fishery</a>; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results. A major branch is medical biostatistics, which is exclusively concerned with medicine and health.

Biostatistical modeling forms an important part of numerous modern biological theories. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of <a href="Gregor%20Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>'s <a href="Mendelian%20inheritance">Mendelian inheritance</a> work, the gaps in understanding between <a href="genetics">genetics</a> and evolutionary <a href="Darwinism">Darwinism</a> led to vigorous debate between biometricians, such as <a href="Walter%20Frank%20Raphael%20Weldon">Walter Weldon</a> and <a href="Karl%20Pearson">Karl Pearson</a>, and Mendelians, such as <a href="Charles%20Benedict%20Davenport">Charles Davenport</a>, <a href="William%20Bateson">William Bateson</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Johannsen">Wilhelm Johannsen</a>. By the 1930s, statisticians and models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-Darwinian <a href="modern%20evolutionary%20synthesis">modern evolutionary synthesis</a>.

The leading figures in the establishment of <a href="population%20genetics">population genetics</a> and this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology.

These and other biostatisticians, <a href="mathematical%20biology">mathematical biologists</a>, and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together <a href="evolutionary%20biology">evolutionary biology</a> and <a href="genetics">genetics</a> into a consistent, coherent whole that could begin to be <a href="Statistics">quantitative</a>ly modeled.

In parallel to this overall development, the pioneering work of <a href="D%27Arcy%20Thompson">D'Arcy Thompson</a> in "On Growth and Form" also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study.

Despite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not <a href="qualitative%20data">qualitatively</a> apparent. One anecdote describes <a href="Thomas%20Hunt%20Morgan">Thomas Hunt Morgan</a> banning the <a href="Friden%2C%20Inc.">Friden calculator</a> from his department at <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a>, saying "Well, I am like a guy who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, I'm not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in <a href="placer%20mining">placer mining</a>."

Recent developments have made a large impact on biostatistics. Two important changes have been the ability to collect data on a high-throughput scale, and the ability to perform much more complex analysis using computational techniques.

New biomedical technologies like <a href="DNA%20microarray">microarrays</a>, <a href="DNA%20sequencing">next generation sequencers</a> (for genomics) and <a href="mass%20spectrometers">mass spectrometry</a> (for proteomics) generate enormous amounts of data, allowing many tests to be performed simultaneously. Careful analysis with biostatistical methods is required to separate the signal from the noise. For example, a microarray could be used to measure many thousands of genes simultaneously, determining which of them have different expression in diseased cells compared to normal cells. However, only a fraction of genes will be differentially expressed.

<a href="Multicollinearity">Multicollinearity</a> often occurs in high-throughput biostatistical settings. Due to high intercorrelation between the predictors (such as <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> levels), the information of one predictor might be contained in another one. It could be that only 5% of the predictors are responsible for 90% of the variability of the response. In such a case, one could apply the biostatistical technique of dimension reduction (for example via principal component analysis). Classical statistical techniques like linear or logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis do not work well for high dimensional data (i.e. when the number of observations n is smaller than the number of features or predictors p: n < p). As a matter of fact, one can get quite high R-values despite very low predictive power of the statistical model. These classical statistical techniques (esp. least squares linear regression) were developed for low dimensional data (i.e. where the number of observations n is much larger than the number of predictors p: n » p). In cases of high dimensionality, one should always consider an independent validation test set and the corresponding residual sum of squares (RSS) and R of the validation test set, not those of the training set.

Often, it is useful to pool information from multiple predictors together. For example, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) considers the perturbation of whole (functionally related) gene sets rather than of single genes. These gene sets might be known biochemical pathways or otherwise functionally related genes. The advantage of this approach is that it is more robust: It is more likely that a single gene is found to be falsely perturbed than it is that a whole pathway is falsely perturbed. Furthermore, one can integrate the accumulated knowledge about biochemical pathways (like the <a href="JAK-STAT%20signaling%20pathway">JAK-STAT signaling pathway</a>) using this approach.

On the other hand, the advent of modern computer technology and relatively cheap computing resources have enabled computer-intensive biostatistical methods like <a href="Bootstrapping%20%28statistics%29">bootstrapping</a> and <a href="Resampling%20%28statistics%29">resampling</a> methods.

In recent times, <a href="random%20forests">random forests</a> have gained popularity as a method for performing <a href="statistical%20classification">statistical classification</a>. Random forest techniques generate a panel of decision trees. Decision trees have the advantage that you can draw them and interpret them (even with a very basic understanding of mathematics and statistics). Random Forests have thus been used for clinical decision support systems.


Almost all educational programmes in biostatistics are at <a href="postgraduate">postgraduate</a> level. They are most often found in schools of public health, affiliated with schools of medicine, forestry, or agriculture, or as a focus of application in departments of statistics.

In the United States, where several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments, many other top-tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments, such as <a href="epidemiology">epidemiology</a>. Thus, departments carrying the name "biostatistics" may exist under quite different structures. For instance, relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on <a href="bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a> and <a href="computational%20biology">computational biology</a>, whereas older departments, typically affiliated with schools of <a href="public%20health">public health</a>, will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s as well as bioinformatics. In larger universities where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist, the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration. In general, the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics program is twofold: (i) statistics departments will often host theoretical/methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and (ii) statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry (<a href="quality%20control">quality control</a>), business and <a href="economics">economics</a> and biological areas other than medicine.

British and Irish Lions

The British and Irish Lions is a <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> team selected from players eligible for any of the <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a> – the national sides of the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>; <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>, <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a>, <a href="Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a>. The Lions are a <a href="Test%20match%20%28rugby%20union%29">Test</a> side, and generally select international players, but they can pick <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">uncapped</a> players available to any one of the four unions. The team currently tours every four years, with these rotating among Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The <a href="2009%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">2009 Test series</a> was lost to <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">South Africa</a>, while the <a href="2013%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia">2013 Test series</a> was won over Australia. The most recent series, the <a href="2017%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">2017 Test series</a> against the world champions, <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a>, was drawn .

From 1888 onwards combined rugby sides from the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> toured the Southern Hemisphere. The first tour was a commercial venture, and was undertaken without official backing. The six subsequent visits enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities, before the 1910 South Africa tour, which was the first tour representative of the four Home Unions. In 1949 the four Home Unions formally created a Tours Committee and for the first time, every player of the 1950 Lions squad had played internationally before the tour. The 1950s tours saw high win rates in provincial games, but the Test series were typically lost or drawn. The winning series in 1971 (New Zealand) and 1974 (South Africa) changed this pattern. The last tour of the <a href="amateurism">amateur</a> age took place in 1993.

The multi-nation team that is today named the British and Irish Lions first came into existence in 1888 as the Shaw & Shrewsbury Team. It was then primarily English in composition but also contained players from Scotland and Wales. Later the name <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> became associated with the team. On their <a href="1950%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand%20and%20Australia">1950 tour</a> of New Zealand and Australia they officially adopted the name British Lions, the nickname first used by British and South African journalists on the 1924 South African tour after the lion emblem on their ties, the emblem on their jerseys having been dropped in favour of the four-quartered badge with the symbols of the four represented unions.

When the team first emerged in the 19th century, it represented the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>, then one single state. The team continued to exist after the <a href="Irish%20war%20of%20independence">Irish war of independence</a> and <a href="Irish%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> and the subsequent division of Ireland in 1922 into the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> (later the state of <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>) and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. To avoid ambiguity and possible offence to Irish players, it was later decided to define the team's identity as representing the two sovereign states – the United Kingdom and Ireland – with the team members being either "British" or "Irish". From the <a href="2001%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia">2001 tour</a> of Australia, the official name British and Irish Lions has been used. The team is often referred to simply as the Lions.

As the Lions represent two sovereign states, they do not have a national anthem. For the 2005 tour to New Zealand, the Lions management commissioned a song, "<a href="The%20Power%20of%20Four">The Power of Four</a>", although it was met with little support among Lions fans at the matches and was not used on the 2009 or 2013 Tours.

For more than half a century, the Lions have been synonymous with the red jersey that sports the amalgamated crests of the four unions. However, prior to 1950 the strip went through a number of significantly different formats.

In 1888, the promoter of the first expedition to Australia and New Zealand, <a href="Arthur%20Shrewsbury">Arthur Shrewsbury</a>, demanded "something that would be good material and yet take them by storm out here". The result was a jersey in thick red, white and blue hoops, worn above white shorts and dark socks. The tours to South Africa in 1891 and 1896 retained the red, white and blue theme but this time as red and white hooped jerseys and dark blue shorts and socks. The 1899 trip to Australia saw a reversion to red, white and blue jerseys, but with the blue used in thick hoops and the red and white in thin bands. The shorts remained blue, as did the socks although a white flash was added to the latter. The one-off test in 1999 between England and Australia that was played to commemorate Australia's first test against Reverend <a href="Matthew%20Mullineux">Matthew Mullineux</a>'s British side saw England wear an updated version of this jersey. In 1903, the South Africa tour followed on from the 1896 tour, with red and white hooped jerseys. The slight differences were that the red hoops were slightly thicker than the white (the opposite was true in 1896), and the white flash on the socks introduced in 1899 was partially retained. The Australia tour of 1904 saw exactly the same kit as in 1899, and it seemed that the British touring sides had settled on kits particular to the host destination. However, in 1908 with the Scottish and Irish unions refusing to be involved, the Anglo-Welsh side only sported red jerseys with a thick white band on their jerseys on tour to Australia and New Zealand. Blue shorts were retained, but the socks were for the first time red, with a white flash.

The Scots were once again involved in Dr Tom Smyth's 1910 team to South Africa. Thus, dark blue jerseys, were introduced with white shorts and the red socks of 1908. The jerseys also had a single lion-rampant crest. The 1924 tour returned to South Africa, retaining the blue jerseys but now with shorts to match. It is the 1924 tour that is credited as being the first in which the team were referred to as "the Lions", the irony being that it was on this tour that the single lion-rampant crest was replaced with the forerunner of the four-quartered badge with the symbols of the four represented unions, that is still worn today. Although the lion had been dropped from the jersey, the players had worn the lion motif on their ties as they arrived in South Africa, which led the press and public referring to them as "the Lions".

The unofficial <a href="1927%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Argentina">1927 Argentina tour</a> used the same kit and badge. So powerful was the attribution of "the Lions" nickname that three heraldic versions of the animal returned as the jersey badge in 1930. This was the tour to New Zealand where the tourists' now standard blue jerseys caused some controversy. The convention in rugby is for the home side to accommodate its guests when there is a clash of kit. The New Zealand side, by then already synonymous with the appellation "All Blacks", had an all black kit that clashed with the Lions' blue. After much reluctance and debate New Zealand agreed to change for the Tests and the All Blacks became the All Whites for the first time. On the 1930 tour a delegation led by the Irish lock <a href="George%20Beamish">George Beamish</a> expressed their displeasure at the fact that whilst the blue of Scotland, white of England and red of Wales were represented in the strip there was no green for Ireland. A green flash was added to the socks, which from 1938 became a green turnover (although on blue socks thus eliminating red from the kit), and that has remained a feature of the strip ever since. In 1936, the four-quartered badge returned for the <a href="1936%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Argentina">tour to Argentina</a> and has remained on the kits ever since, but other than that the strip remained the same.

The adoption of the red jersey happened in the 1950 tour. A return to New Zealand was accompanied by a desire to avoid the controversy of 1930 and so red replaced blue for the jersey with the resultant kit being that which is still worn today, the combination of red jersey, white shorts and green and blue socks, representing the four unions. The only additions to the strip since 1950 began appearing in 1993, with the addition of kit suppliers logos in prominent positions. Umbro had in 1989 asked for "maximum brand exposure whenever possible" but this did not affect the kit's appearance. Since then, Nike then Adidas have had more overt branding on the shirts, with sponsors <a href="Scottish%20Provident">Scottish Provident</a> (1997), (2001), <a href="Zurich%20Assurance">Zurich</a> (2005) and <a href="HSBC">HSBC</a> (2009 & 2013).

The earliest tours date back to 1888, when a 21-man squad visited Australia and New Zealand. The squad drew players from England, Scotland and Wales, though English players predominated. The 35-match tour of two host nations included no tests, but the side played provincial, city and academic sides, winning 27 matches. They played 19 games of <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>, against prominent clubs in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and South Australia, winning six and drawing one of these (see <a href="Australian%20rules%20football%20in%20England">Australian rules football in England</a>).

The first tour, although unsanctioned by rugby bodies, established the concept of Northern Hemisphere sporting sides touring to the Southern Hemisphere. Three years after the first tour, the <a href="Western%20Province%20%28rugby%29">Western Province union</a> invited rugby bodies in Britain to tour South Africa. Some saw the <a href="1891%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1891 team</a> – the first sanctioned by the <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a> – as the <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">English national team</a>, though others referred to it as "the British Isles". The tourists played a total of twenty matches, three of them tests. The team also played the regional side of South Africa (South Africa did not exist as a political unit in 1891), winning all three matches. In a notable event of the tour, the touring side presented the <a href="Currie%20Cup">Currie Cup</a> to <a href="Griqualand%20West">Griqualand West</a>, the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour.

Five years later a British Isles side returned to South Africa. They played one extra match on this tour, making the total of 21 games, including four tests against South Africa, with the British Isles winning three of them. The squad had a notable Irish orientation, with the Irish national team contributing six players to the 21-man squad.

In 1899 the British Isles touring side returned to Australia for the first time since the unofficial tour of 1888. The squad of 23 for the first time ever had players from each of the home nations. The team again participated in 21 matches, playing state teams as well as northern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> sides and <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> teams. A four-test series took place against <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a>, the tourists winning three out of the four. The team returned via Hawaii and Canada playing additional games on route.

Four years later, in 1903, the British Isles team returned to South Africa. The opening performance of the side proved disappointing from the tourists' point of view, with defeats in its opening three matches by Western Province sides in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>. From then on the team experienced mixed results, though more wins than losses. The side lost the test series to South Africa, drawing twice, but with the South Africans winning the decider 8 to nil.

No more than twelve months passed before the British Isles team ventured to Australia and New Zealand in 1904. The tourists devastated the Australian teams, winning every single game. Australia also lost all three tests to the visitors, even getting held to a standstill in two of the three games. Though the New Zealand leg of the tour did not take long in comparison to the number of Australian games, the British Isles experienced considerable difficulty across the Tasman after whitewashing the Australians. The team managed two early wins before losing the test to New Zealand and only winning one more game as well as drawing once. Despite their difficulties in New Zealand, the tour proved a raging success on-field for the British Isles.

In 1908, another tour took place to Australia and New Zealand. In a reversal of previous practice, the planners allocated more matches in New Zealand rather than in Australia: perhaps the strength of the New Zealand teams and the heavy defeats of all Australian teams on the previous tour influenced this decision. Some commentators thought that this tour hoped to reach out to rugby communities in Australia, as rugby league (infamously) started in Australia in 1908. The Anglo-Welsh side (Irish and Scottish unions did not participate) performed well in all the non-test matches, but drew a test against New Zealand and lost the other two.

Visits that took place before the 1910 South Africa tour (the first selected by a committee from the four Home Unions) had enjoyed a growing degree of support from the authorities, although only one of these included representatives of all four nations. The 1910 tour to South Africa marked the official beginning of British Isles rugby tours: the inaugural tour operating under all four unions. The team performed moderately against the non-test parties, claiming victories in just over half their matches. The test series, however, went to South Africa, who won two of the three games. A side managed by Oxford University — supposedly the England rugby team, but actually including three Scottish players — toured Argentina at the time: the people of Argentina termed it the "Combined British".

The next British Isles team tour did not take place until <a href="1924%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1924</a>, again in South Africa. The team, led by <a href="Ronald%20Cove-Smith">Ronald Cove-Smith</a>, struggled with injuries and lost three of the four test matches, drawing the other 3–3. In total, 21 games were played, with the touring side winning 9, drawing 3 and losing 9.

In 1927 a <a href="1927%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Argentina">short, nine-game series</a> took place in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, with the British isles winning all nine encounters; the tour did however become a financial success for <a href="Rugby%20union%20in%20Argentina">Argentine rugby</a>. After a seemingly long absence from New Zealand, the Lions returned in 1930 to some success. The Lions won all of their games that did not have test status except for the matches against <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> and <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>; they did however lose three of their four test matches against <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a>, winning the first test 6–3. The side also visited Australia, losing a test but winning five out of the six non-test games.

In <a href="1936%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Argentina">1936</a> the British Isles visited Argentina for the second time, winning all ten of their matches and only conceding nine points in the whole tour. Two years later in 1938 the British Isles toured in South Africa, winning more than half of their normal matches. Despite having lost the test series to South Africa by game three, they won the final test. This is when they were named THE LIONS by their then Captain Sam Walker.

The first post-war tour went to New Zealand and Australia in 1950. The Lions, sporting newly redesigned jerseys and displaying a fresh style of play, managed to win 22 and draw one of 29 matches over the two nations. The Lions won the opening four fixtures before losing to <a href="Otago">Otago</a> and <a href="Southland%20Region">Southland</a>, but succeeded in holding the All Blacks to a 9–9 draw. The Lions performed well in the remaining All Black tests though they lost all three, the team did not lose another non-test in the New Zealand leg of the tour. The Lions won all their games in Australia except for their final fixture against a <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> XV in <a href="Newcastle%2C%20Australia">Newcastle</a>. They won both tests against <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a>, in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and in Sydney.

In 1955 the Lions toured South Africa and left with another imposing record, one draw and 19 wins from the 25 fixtures. The four-test series against <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">South Africa</a>, a thrilling affair, ended in a drawn series.

The 1959 tour to Australia and New Zealand marked once again a very successful tour for the Lions, who only lost six of their 35 fixtures. The Lions easily won both tests against Australia and lost the first three tests against New Zealand, but did find victory (9–6) in the final test.

After the glittering decade of the 1950s, the first tour of the 1960s proved not nearly as successful as previous ones. The 1962 tour to South Africa saw the Lions still win 16 of their 25 games, but did not fare well against the Springboks, losing three of the four tests. For the 1966 tour to Australia and New Zealand <a href="John%20Robins%20%28rugby%20player%29">John Robins</a> became the first Lions Coach, and the trip started off very well for the Lions, who stormed through Australia, winning five non-tests and drawing one; and most notably defeating Australia in two tests as well. The Lions however experienced mixed results during the New Zealand leg of the tour, as well as losing all of the tests against the All Blacks. The Lions also played a test against <a href="Canada%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Canada</a> on their way home, winning 19 to 8 in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. The 1968 tour of South Africa saw the Lions win 15 of their 16 provincial matches, but the team actually lost three tests against the Springboks and drew one.

The 1970s saw a renaissance for the Lions. The 1971 team, centred around the skilled Welsh half-back pairing of <a href="Gareth%20Edwards">Gareth Edwards</a> and <a href="Barry%20John">Barry John</a>, secured a series win over the All Blacks. The tour started with a loss to Queensland but proceeded to storm through the next provincial fixtures, winning 11 games in a row. The Lions then went on to defeat the All Blacks in <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>. The Lions would only lose a single match on the rest of the tour, and won the test series against New Zealand, winning and drawing the last two games, to take the series two wins to one.

One of the best-known and most successful Lions team toured South Africa in 1974 under the esteemed Irish forward <a href="Willie%20John%20McBride">Willie John McBride</a>. It went through 22 games unbeaten, and triumphed 3–0 (with one drawn) in the test open series. The test series featured a lot of violence. The management of the Lions concluded that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression. At that time, test match referees came from the home nation, substitutions took place only if a doctor found a player unable to continue and there were no video cameras or sideline officials to prevent violent play. The Lions decided "to get their retaliation in first" with the infamous "<a href="99%20call">99 call</a>". The Lions postulated that a South African referee would probably not send off all of the Lions if they all retaliated against "blatant thuggery". Famous video footage of the 'battle of <a href="EPRFU%20Stadium">Boet Erasmus Stadium'</a> shows <a href="JPR%20Williams">JPR Williams</a> running over half of the pitch and launching himself at Van Heerden after such a call.

The 1977 tour to New Zealand saw the Lions drop only one non-test out of 21 games, a loss to a Universities side. The team did not win the test series though, winning one game but losing the other three.

In August 1977 the British Lions made a stopover in Fiji on the way home from their tour of New Zealand. Fiji beat them 25–21 at Buckhurst Park, Suva.

The Lions toured <a href="1980%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">South Africa in 1980</a>, and completed a flawless non-test record, winning 14 out of 14 matches. The Lions however lost the first three tests to South Africa, winning the last one, with the series already won by the Springboks.

The <a href="1983%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">1983 tour to New Zealand</a> saw the team successful in the non-test games, winning all but two games, but being whitewashed in the test series against the All Blacks.

A tour to South Africa by the Lions was anticipated in 1986. However, the invitation for the Lions to tour South Africa was never accepted because of controversy surrounding <a href="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, and the tour did not go ahead. The Lions did not return to South Africa until 1997, after the Apartheid era. A Lions team was selected in April 1986 for the <a href="International%20Rugby%20Board">International Rugby Board</a> centenary match against a '<a href="The%20Rest%20%28rugby%20union%29">The Rest</a>'. The team was organised by the Four Home Unions Committee and the players were given the status of official British Lions.

The Lions tour to <a href="1989%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia">Australia in 1989</a> was a short affair, being only 12 matches in total. The tour was very successful for the Lions, who won all eight non-test matches and won the test series against Australia, two to one.

The tour to <a href="1993%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand in 1993</a> was the last of the amateur era. The Lions won six and lost four non-test matches, and lost the test series 2–1.
The tour to <a href="1997%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">South Africa in 1997</a> was a success for the Lions, who completed the tour with only two losses, and won the test series 2–1.

In 2001, the ten-game <a href="2001%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia">tour to Australia</a> saw the <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wallabies</a> win the test series 2–1. This series saw the first award of the <a href="Tom%20Richards%20Trophy">Tom Richards Trophy</a>. In the <a href="2005%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">Lions' 2005 tour to New Zealand</a>, coached by Clive Woodward, the Lions won seven games against provincial teams, were defeated by the New Zealand Maori team, and suffered heavy defeats in all three tests.

The Lions faced the <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> winners South Africa, with <a href="Ian%20McGeechan">Ian McGeechan</a> leading a coaching team including <a href="Warren%20Gatland">Warren Gatland</a>, <a href="Shaun%20Edwards">Shaun Edwards</a> and <a href="Rob%20Howley">Rob Howley</a>. The Lions were captained by Irish lock <a href="Paul%20O%27Connell">Paul O'Connell</a>. The initial Lions selection consisted of fourteen Irish players, thirteen Welsh, eight English and two Scots in the 37-man squad.

In the first Test on 20 June, they lost 26–21, and lost the series in the second 28–25 in a tightly-fought game at Loftus Versfeld on 27 June. The Lions won the third Test 28–9 at <a href="Coca-Cola%20Park%20%28Johannesburg%29">Ellis Park</a>, and the series finished 2–1 to South Africa.

During June 2013 the British and Irish Lions toured Australia.

Former Scotland and Lions full-back <a href="Andy%20Irvine%20%28rugby%20union%29">Andy Irvine</a> was appointed as tour manager in 2010. <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a> head coach <a href="Warren%20Gatland">Warren Gatland</a> was the Lions' head coach, and their tour captain was <a href="Sam%20Warburton">Sam Warburton</a>.

The tour started in Hong Kong with a match against the <a href="Barbarian%20F.C.">Barbarians</a> before moving on to Australia for the main tour featuring six provincial matches and three tests.

The Lions won all but one non-test matches, losing to the <a href="Brumbies">Brumbies</a> 14–12 on 18 June. The first test was followed shortly after this, which saw the Lions go 1-up over Australia winning 23–21. Australia did have a chance to take the win in the final moments of the game, but a missed penalty by <a href="Kurtley%20Beale">Kurtley Beale</a> saw the Lions take the win. The Wallabies drew the series in the second test winning 16–15, though the Lions had a chance to steal the win had it not been because of a missed penalty by <a href="Leigh%20Halfpenny">Leigh Halfpenny</a>. With tour captain Warburton out of the final test due to injury, <a href="Alun%20Wyn%20Jones">Alun Wyn Jones</a> took over the captaincy in the final test in Sydney. The final test was won by the Lions in what was a record win, winning 41–16 to earn their first series win since <a href="1997%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1997</a> and their first over Australia since <a href="1989%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia">1989</a>.

The current British and Irish Lions tour is to New Zealand, starting in June 2017.
The Test tour ended in a Test draw.

Overall tour results

The Lions tour three Southern Hemisphere nations; Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. They also routinely toured in Argentina before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Tours currently take place every four years. The most recent tour <a href="2017%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">was to New Zealand in 2017</a>, and before that the Lions toured <a href="2013%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia">visited Australia in June–July 2013</a>.

In a break with tradition, a "home" fixture against <a href="Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Argentina</a> took place at <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in Cardiff on 23 May 2005, before the Lions went to <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a>. It finished in a draw, 25–25.

On tour, games take place against local provinces, clubs or representative sides as well as the full tests against the host's national team.

The Lions, and their predecessor teams, have often played games against other nearby countries on tour. For example, they played <a href="Zimbabwe%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Rhodesia</a> (the future <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>) in <a href="1910%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1910</a>, <a href="1924%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1924</a>, <a href="1938%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1938</a>, <a href="1955%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1955</a>, <a href="1962%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1962</a>, <a href="1968%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1968</a> & <a href="1974%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1974</a> during their tours to South Africa. They also were beaten by <a href="Fiji%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Fiji</a> on their <a href="1977%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">1977 tour to New Zealand</a>. In addition, they toured pre-independence <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> (then <a href="South%20West%20Africa">South West Africa</a>), in <a href="1955%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1955</a>, <a href="1962%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1962</a>, <a href="1968%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1968</a>, and <a href="1974%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa">1974</a>.

There have also been games in other countries on the way home. These include games in in <a href="1959%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand">1959</a> and <a href="1966%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand">1966</a>, <a href="East%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20team">East Africa</a> (then mostly <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, and held in <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>), and an unofficial game against <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ceylon</a> (future Sri Lanka) in <a href="1950%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand%20and%20Australia">1950</a>.

Previous tours have seen some non-Test players become demotivated, but more recently this issue has reduced because of high injury rates, increased use of replacements and greater selection flexibility.

In recent tours a common issue has been weak opposition in many non-Test games, partly as opposition countries have their top players in national training camps, partly as sides protect top players for domestic games which are seen as more commercially important than Lions games, and possibly partly to prevent the Lions having high standard preparatory games.

The Lions have played a number of "home matches" against international opposition. With the exception of the 2005 home match against Argentina (which was played as a warm-up to the <a href="2005%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand</a>), these matches have been one-offs to mark special occasions:

Bass guitar

The bass guitar (also known as electric bass, or bass) is a <a href="String%20instrument">stringed instrument</a> played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, <a href="Slapping%20%28music%29">slapping</a>, popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or <a href="guitar%20pick">picking</a> with a <a href="plectrum">plectrum</a>, often known as a pick.

The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>, but with a longer <a href="neck%20%28music%29">neck</a> and <a href="Scale%20length%20%28string%20instruments%29">scale length</a>, and four to six <a href="string%20%28music%29">strings</a> or <a href="Course%20%28music%29">courses</a>. The four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a>, which corresponds to pitches one <a href="octave">octave</a> lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). The bass guitar is a <a href="transposing%20instrument">transposing instrument</a>, as it is notated in <a href="Clef%23Bass%20clef">bass clef</a> an octave higher than it sounds. The electric bass guitar has <a href="pickup%20%28music%20technology%29">pickups</a> and needs to be connected to an <a href="Bass%20instrument%20amplification">amplifier and speaker</a>, to make a sound loud enough to compete with other instruments.

Since the 1960s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a> in <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> as the bass instrument in the <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a>. While types of <a href="bassline">bassline</a>s vary widely from one style of music to another, the <a href="bassist">bassist</a> usually plays a similar role: anchoring the <a href="chord%20progression">harmonic framework</a> and establishing the beat. Many styles of music include the bass guitar, including <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>, <a href="pop%20music">pop</a>, <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>, <a href="country%20music">country</a>, <a href="reggae">reggae</a>, <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a>, <a href="blues">blues</a>, symphonic rock, and <a href="jazz">jazz</a>. It is often a solo <a href="musical%20instrument">instrument</a> in jazz, <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a>, <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin</a>, <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> and other rock and metal styles.

In the 1930s, musician and inventor <a href="Paul%20Tutmarc">Paul Tutmarc</a> from <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, who was manufacturing <a href="lap%20steel%20guitar">lap steel guitar</a>s, developed the first electric string bass in its modern form, a <a href="fret">fret</a>ted instrument designed to be played horizontally. The 1935 sales catalog for Tutmarc's electronic musical instrument company, <a href="Audiovox">Audiovox</a>, featured his "Model 736 Bass <a href="Fiddle">Fiddle</a>", a four-stringed, solid-bodied, fretted electric bass instrument with a scale length. The adoption of a guitar's body shape made the instrument easier to hold and transport than any of the existing stringed bass instruments. The addition of frets enabled <a href="bassist">bassist</a>s to play in tune more easily than on fretless acoustic or <a href="electric%20upright%20bass">electric upright bass</a>es. Around 100 of these instruments were made during this period.

Around 1947, Tutmarc's son, Bud, began marketing a similar bass under the Serenader brand name, prominently advertised in the nationally distributed <a href="L.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BD.%20Heater%20Music%20Company">L. D.

In the 1950s, <a href="Leo%20Fender">Leo Fender</a>, with the help of his employee <a href="George%20William%20Fullerton">George Fullerton</a>, developed the first mass-produced electric bass guitar. Fender was the founder of <a href="Fender%20Electric%20Instrument%20Manufacturing%20Company">Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company</a>, which made electric popular brands of electric guitars, basses and amplifiers. Fender's <a href="Fender%20Precision%20Bass">Fender Precision Bass</a>, which began production in October 1951, became a widely copied industry standard for the instrument. The Precision Bass (or "P-bass") evolved from a simple, un-contoured "slab" body design and a <a href="single%20coil%20pickup">single coil pickup</a> similar to that of a <a href="Fender%20Telecaster">Telecaster</a>, to a contoured body design with beveled edges for comfort and a split <a href="single%20coil">single coil</a> pickup.

The "Fender Bass" was a revolutionary new instrument for gigging musicians. In comparison with the large, heavy <a href="upright%20bass">upright bass</a>, which had been the main bass instrument in popular music, folk and country music from the early 1900s to the 1940s, the Fender bass could be easily transported to shows. The bass guitar was also less prone to unwanted <a href="Larsen%20effect">feedback</a> sounds when amplified, than acoustic bass instruments. In 1953 <a href="Monk%20Montgomery">Monk Montgomery</a> became the first bass player to tour with the Fender bass guitar, in <a href="Lionel%20Hampton">Lionel Hampton</a>'s postwar <a href="big%20band">big band</a>. Roy Johnson, and <a href="Shifty%20Henry">Shifty Henry</a> with <a href="Louis%20Jordan">Louis Jordan</a> & His <a href="Tympany%20Five">Tympany Five</a>, were other early Fender bass pioneers. <a href="Bill%20Black">Bill Black</a>, playing with <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, switched from upright bass to the Fender Precision Bass around 1957. The bass guitar was intended to appeal to guitarists as well as upright bass players, and many early pioneers of the instrument, such as <a href="Carol%20Kaye">Carol Kaye</a> and <a href="Joe%20Osborn">Joe Osborn</a>, were originally guitarists.

Following Fender's lead, in 1953, <a href="Gibson%20Guitar%20Corporation">Gibson</a> released the first short scale <a href="violin">violin</a>-shaped electric bass with extendable end pin, allowing it to be played upright or horizontally. Gibson renamed the Electric Bass in 1958 to the <a href="EB-1">EB-1</a>. Also in 1958 Gibson released the maple arched top EB-2 described in the Gibson catalogue as "A hollow-body electric bass that features a Bass/Baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics". In 1959 these were followed by the more conventional-looking <a href="Gibson%20EB-0">EB-0 Bass</a>. The EB-0 was very similar to a <a href="Gibson%20SG">Gibson SG</a> in appearance (although the earliest examples have a slab-sided body shape closer to that of the double-cutaway <a href="Les%20Paul">Les Paul</a> Special).

Whereas Fender basses had pickups mounted in positions in between the base of the neck and the top of the bridge, many of Gibson's early basses featured one <a href="humbucker">humbucking</a> pickup mounted directly against the neck pocket. The <a href="Gibson%20EB-3">EB-3</a>, introduced in 1961, also had a "mini-humbucker" at the bridge position. Gibson basses also tended to be smaller, sleeker instruments; Gibson did not produce a scale bass until 1963 with the release of the <a href="Gibson%20Thunderbird">Thunderbird</a>, which was also the first Gibson bass to use dual-humbucking pickups in a more traditional position, about halfway between the neck and bridge. A number of other companies also began manufacturing bass guitars during the 1950s: <a href="Kay%20Musical%20Instrument%20Company">Kay</a> in 1952, <a href="Hofner">Hofner</a> and <a href="Danelectro">Danelectro</a> in 1956, <a href="Rickenbacker">Rickenbacker</a> in 1957 and <a href="Burns%20London">Burns</a>/Supersound in 1958.

1956 saw the appearance at the German trade fair "Musikmesse Frankfurt" of the distinctive <a href="H%C3%B6fner%20500/1">Höfner 500/1</a> violin bass made using violin construction techniques by Walter <a href="H%C3%B6fner">Höfner</a>, a second generation violin luthier. The instrument is often known as the "<a href="The%20Beatles">Beatle Bass</a>", due to its endorsement and use by Beatles bassist <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. In 1957 <a href="Rickenbacker">Rickenbacker</a> introduced the model 4000 bass, the first bass to feature a neck-through-body design in which the neck is part of the body wood. The Fender and Gibson versions used bolt-on and glued-on necks.

With the explosion of the popularity of <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> in the 1960s, many more manufacturers began making electric basses, including the Japanese manufacturers <a href="Yamaha%20Corporation">Yamaha</a>, <a href="Teisco">Teisco</a> and <a href="Guyatone">Guyatone</a>. First introduced in 1960, the <a href="Fender%20Jazz%20Bass">Fender Jazz Bass</a> was known as the Deluxe Bass and was meant to accompany the <a href="Jazzmaster">Jazzmaster</a> guitar. The Jazz Bass (often referred to as a "J-bass") featured two single-coil pickups, one close to the bridge and one in the Precision bass' split coil pickup position. The earliest production basses had a 'stacked' volume and tone control for each pickup. This was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup, and a single, passive tone control. The Jazz Bass' neck was narrower at the nut than the Precision bass — versus — allowing for easier access to the lower strings and an overall spacing and feel closer to that of an electric guitar, allowing trained guitarists to transition to the bass guitar more easily.

Another visual difference that set the Jazz Bass apart from the Precision is its "offset-waist" body. Pickup shapes on electric basses are often referred to as "P" or "J" pickups in reference to the visual and electrical differences between the Precision Bass and Jazz Bass <a href="pick%20up%20%28music%20technology%29">pickups</a>.

Fender also began production of the <a href="Fender%20Mustang%20Bass">Mustang Bass</a>; a scale length instrument used by bassists such as <a href="Tina%20Weymouth">Tina Weymouth</a> of <a href="Talking%20Heads">Talking Heads</a> and <a href="Bill%20Wyman">Bill Wyman</a> of <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> ("P" and "J" basses have a scale length of , a design echoed on most current production electric basses of all makes). In the 1950s and 1960s, the instrument was often called the "Fender bass", due to <a href="Fender%20Musical%20Instruments%20Corporation">Fender</a>'s early dominance in the market. The <a href="Fender%20VI">Fender VI</a>, a baritone guitar, was tuned one octave lower than standard guitar tuning. It was released in 1961, and was favored by <a href="Jack%20Bruce">Jack Bruce</a> of <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a>.

Gibson introduced the short-scale <a href="Gibson%20EB-3">EB-3</a> in 1961, also used by <a href="Jack%20Bruce">Jack Bruce</a>.

In 1971, <a href="Alembic%20Inc">Alembic</a> established the template for what became known as "boutique" or "high-end" electric bass guitars. These expensive, custom-tailored instruments, as used by <a href="Phil%20Lesh">Phil Lesh</a>, <a href="Jack%20Casady">Jack Casady</a>, and <a href="Stanley%20Clarke">Stanley Clarke</a>, featured unique designs, premium hand-finished wood bodies, and innovative construction techniques such as multi-laminate <a href="Neck-thru">neck-through-body</a> construction and <a href="Carbon%20fiber%20reinforced%20polymer">graphite</a> necks. Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization. Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility. Giving the player the ability to amplify as well as attenuate (turn down) certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company <a href="Wal%20%28bass%29">Wal</a> begin production of a their own range of active basses, and In 1974 <a href="Music%20Man%20%28company%29">Music Man</a> Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, <a href="Forrest%20White">Forrest White</a> and <a href="Leo%20Fender">Leo Fender</a>, introduced the <a href="Music%20Man%20StingRay">StingRay</a>, the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument. Basses with active electronics can include a <a href="preamplifier">preamplifier</a> and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.

Specific bass brands/models became identified with particular styles of music, such as the Rickenbacker 4001 series, which became identified with progressive rock bassists like [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]], and [[Geddy Lee]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], while the StingRay was used by funk/disco players such [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis Johnson]] of the funk band [[The Brothers Johnson]] and [[Bernard Edwards]] of Chic. The 4001 stereo bass was introduced in the late 1960s; it can be heard on from the Beatles "I Am The Walrus".

In the mid-1970s, Alembic and other boutique bass manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], produced four-string and five-string basses with a low "B" string. In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3. In comparison with a standard four-string bass, Jackson's six-string adds a low B string and a high C string. These 5 and 6-string "extended-range basses" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]] as they reduced the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like "drop D", and also allowed the bassist to play more notes from the same position on the fretboard with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.

[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]

In the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve a "upright bass" sound with a short scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's "Unplugged"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.

During the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range—a low "B" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive "boutique" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional "passive" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular amongst new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].

Bass bodies are typically made of wood, although other materials such as [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|graphite]] (for example, some of the [[Steinberger]] designs) and other lightweight composite materials have also been used. While a wide variety of [[tonewood|woods]] are suitable for use in the body, neck, and fretboard of the bass guitar, the most common types of wood used are similar to those used for electric guitars; [[alder]], [[Fraxinus|ash]] or [[mahogany]] for the body, [[maple]] for the neck, and [[rosewood (timber)|rosewood]] or [[ebony]] for the fretboard. While these traditional standards are most common, for tonal or aesthetic reasons luthiers more commonly experiment with different tonewoods on basses than with electric guitars (though this is changing), and rarer woods like [[walnut]] and figured [[maple]], as well as exotic woods like [[bubinga]], [[wenge]], [[koa]], and [[peltogyne|purpleheart]], are often used as accent woods in the neck or on the face of mid- to high-priced production basses and on custom-made and boutique instruments.

Other design options include finishes, such as lacquer, wax and oil; flat and carved designs; [[luthier]]-produced custom-designed instruments; headless basses, which have tuning machines in the bridge of the instrument (e.g., [[Steinberger]] and [[Hohner]] designs) and several artificial materials such as [[luthite]]. The use of artificial materials (e.g., [[BassLab]]) allows for unique production techniques such as die-casting, to produce complex body shapes. While most basses have solid bodies, they can also include hollow chambers to increase the resonance or reduce the weight of the instrument. Some basses are built with entirely hollow bodies, which change the tone and resonance of the instrument. [[Acoustic bass guitar]]s have a hollow wooden body constructed similarly to an [[acoustic guitar]], and are typically equipped with [[piezoelectric]] or magnetic pickups and amplified.

Instruments handmade by highly skilled luthiers are becoming increasingly available in the 2010s. Exotic materials used in high-end instruments include woods such as [[bubinga]], [[wenge]], [[ovangkol]], [[ebony]] and [[goncalo alves]]. [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|Graphite composite]] is used to make lightweight necks Exotic woods are used on more expensive instruments: for example, Alembic uses cocobolo as a body or top layer material because of its attractive grain. Warwick bass guitars are also well known for exotic hardwoods: most of the necks are made of [[ovangkol]], and the fingerboards use [[wenge]] or [[ebony]]. Solid [[bubinga]] bodies are also used for their tonal and aesthetic qualities.

A common feature of more expensive basses is "neck-through" construction. Instead of milling the body from a single piece of wood (or "bookmatched" halves) and then attaching the neck into a pocket (so-called "bolt-on" design), neck-through basses are constructed first by assembling the neck, which may comprise one, three, five or more layers of wood in vertical stripes, which are longer than the length of the fretboard. To this elongated neck, the body is attached as two "wings," which may also be made up of several layers. The entire bass is then milled and shaped. "Neck-through" construction advertisements claim this approach provides better sustain and a mellower tone than "bolt-on" neck construction. While neck-through construction is most common in handmade "boutique" basses, some models of mass-produced basses such as Ibanez's BTB series also have neck-through construction. Bolt-on neck construction does not necessarily imply a cheaply made instrument; virtually all traditional Fender designs still use bolt-on necks, including its high-end instruments costing thousands of dollars, and many boutique luthiers such as [[Sadowsky]] build bolt-on basses as well as neck-through instruments.

The number of frets installed on a bass guitar neck may vary. The original Fender basses had 20 frets, and most bass guitars have between 20 and 24 frets or fret positions. Instruments with between 24 and 36 frets (2 and 3 octaves) also exist. Instruments with more frets are used by bassists who play bass solos, as more frets gives them additional upper range notes. When a bass has a large number of frets, such as a 36 fret instrument, the bass may have a deeper "cutaway" to enable the performer to reach the higher pitches. Like [[electric guitar]]s, fretted basses typically have markers on the fingerboard and on the side of the neck to assist the player in determining where notes and important harmonic points are. The markers indicate the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th fret and 12th fret (the 12th fret being the octave of the open string) and on the octave-up equivalents of the 3rd fret and as many additional positions as an instrument has frets for. Typically, one marker is used for the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th fret positions and two markers are used for the 12th fret.

The long scale necks on Leo Fender's basses—with a [[scale (string instruments)|scale length]] (distance between [[nut (string instrument)|nut]] and [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]]) of — set the standard for electric basses, although "short scale" instruments, such as the [[Höfner 500/1]] "violin bass" played by [[Paul McCartney]], and the [[Fender Mustang Bass]] are also common. Short scale instruments use the same E-A-D-G tuning as a regular long scale instrument. Short scale instruments are good choices for bassists with smaller hands, such as children or young teens who are just starting the instrument. While , , and scale lengths were once only available in "boutique" instruments, in the 2000s (decade), many manufacturers began offering these "extra long" scale lengths. This extra long scale provides a higher string tension, which may yield a more defined, deep tone on the low "B" string of five- and six-stringed instruments (or detuned four-string basses).

[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]

Another design consideration for the bass is whether to use [[fret]]s on the fingerboard. On a fretted bass, the metal frets divide the fingerboard into [[semitone]] divisions (as on an [[electric guitar]] or [[acoustic guitar]]). Fretless basses have a distinct sound, because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard with the fingers, as with the [[double bass]]. The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player's finger. The fretless bass allows players to use the expressive approaches such as [[glissando]] (sliding up or down in pitch, with all of the pitches in between sounding), and true [[vibrato]] (in which the player alternates adds expression to a note by rocking the finger which is stopping the note and raising or lowering the pitch slightly). Players may also play music utilising [[Microtonal music|microtones]], or temperaments other than [[equal temperament]], such as [[just intonation]].

While fretless basses are often associated with [[jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]], bassists from other genres have used fretless basses, such as [[Freebo]] (country), [[Rick Danko]] (rock/blues), [[Rod Clements]] (folk), [[Steve DiGiorgio]] (metal) and [[Colin Edwin]] (modern/[[progressive rock]]). Some bassists alternate between fretted and fretless basses in performances, according to the type of material or tunes they are performing, e.g., [[Pino Palladino]] or [[Tony Levin]].

The first fretless bass guitar was made by [[Bill Wyman]] in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass by simply removing the frets and filling in the slots cut into the neck with wood putty. The first production fretless bass was the [[Ampeg]] AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Around 1970, [[Rick Danko]] from [[The Band]] began to use an Ampeg fretless, which he modified with Fender pickups—as heard on the 1971 "[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]" studio album and the "[[Rock of Ages (album)|Rock of Ages]]" album [[live album|recorded live]] in 1971. Danko said, "It's a challenge to play fretless because you have to really [[Playing by ear|use your ear]]." In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] had the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass coated in epoxy resin, allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound. Some fretless basses have "fret line" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck.

Tapewound (double bass type) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so the metal string windings do not wear down the [[fingerboard]]. Tapewound and flatwound strings have a distinctive tone and sound. Some fretless basses have [[epoxy]]-coated fingerboards, or fingerboards made of an epoxy composite like [[micarta]], to increase the fingerboard's durability, enhance [[sustain]], and give a brighter tone.

[[File:Bass guitar headstock.jpg|thumb|right|Tuning machines (with spiral metal [[worm gear]]s) are mounted on the back of the headstock on the bass guitar neck]]

The standard design for the electric bass guitar has four [[string (music)|strings]], tuned E, A, D and G, in fourths such that the open highest string, G, is an eleventh (an octave and a fourth) below [[middle C]], making the tuning of all four strings the same as that of the [[double bass]] (E–A–D–G). This tuning is also the same as the standard tuning on the lower-pitched four strings on a six-string guitar, only an octave lower.

There are a range of different string types including all-metal strings, which are available in many varieties of winding or finishing, each of which produce different tone, including [[roundwound]], [[flatwound]], [[String (music)#Halfwound, ground wound, pressure wound|halfwound, ground wound, and pressure wound]]); as well as metal strings with different coverings, such as tapewound and wound with plastic coatings. The variety of materials used in the strings gives bass players a range of tonal options. In the 1950s and early 1960s, bassists mostly used flatwound strings with a smooth surface, which had a smooth, damped sound reminiscent of a double bass. In the late 1960s and 1970s, players began using roundwound bass strings, which produce a brighter tone similar to steel guitar strings, though flatwounds also remained in use by players seeking a vintage tone. Roundwounds have a brighter [[timbre]] (tone) with longer [[sustain]] than flatwounds.

A variety of tuning options and number of string courses (courses are when strings are put together in groups of two, often at the unison or octave) have been used to extend the range of the instrument, or facilitate different modes of playing, or allow for different playing sounds. The most common are four, five, or six strings:

[[File:D-Tuner.jpg|thumb|A bass guitar headstock with detuner set to "D" position]]

Some bassists use other types of tuning to extend the range or get other benefits, such as providing multiple octaves of notes at any given position, or a larger tonal range. Instrument types or tunings used for this purpose include basses with fewer than four strings (one-string bass guitars, two-string bass guitars, three-string bass guitars [tuned to E–A–D]) and alternative tunings (e.g., tenor bass).

[[Extended-range bass|Extended range basses]] (ERBs) are basses with six to twelve strings—with the additional strings used for range rather than unison or octave pairs. A seven-string bass (B–E–A–D–G–C–F) was built by luthier Michael Tobias in 1987. This instrument, commissioned by bassist Garry Goodman, was an early example of a bass with more than six single course strings. In 1999 South American ERB player [[Igor Saavedra]] designed one of the first eight-string ERBs known, and asked Luthier Alfonso Iturra to build it for him.

[[File:7String.jpg|thumb|left|A seven-string fretless bass]]

In 2011 Warwick released a new Thumb NT 7 bass for Jeroen Paul Thesseling, featuring a scale with subcontra tuning F–B–E–A–D–G–C. Yves Carbonne developed ten- and twelve-string fretless subbass guitars.

[[Piccolo bass]]es are cosmetically similar to a four-stringed electric bass guitar, but usually tuned one whole [[octave]] higher than a normal bass. The first electric piccolo bass was constructed by luthier Carl Thompson for [[Stanley Clarke]]. To allow for the raised tuning, the strings are thinner, and the length of the neck (the [[Scale (string instruments)#Electric bass|scale]]) may be shorter. Several companies manufacture piccolo sets that can be put on any regular bass, thereby converting any bass into a piccolo bass. Because of the thinner strings, a new nut may be required to hold the strings. Some people prefer a slightly shorter scale, such as , as the higher tension required for longer scale lengths coupled with the thinner gauge of higher-pitched strings can make a long-scale piccolo bass difficult to play. The tuning varies with the personal tastes of the artist, as does the number of strings. [[Joey DeMaio]] from the heavy metal band [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]] plays with four strings on his piccolo bass. Jazz bassist [[John Patitucci]] used a six-string piccolo bass, unaccompanied, on his song "Sachi's Eyes" on his album "One More Angel". [[Michael Manring]] has used a five-string piccolo bass in several altered tunings. Michael uses D'Addario EXL 280 piccolo bass strings on his four-string hyperbass, made by [[Zon Guitars]].

Most electric bass guitars use magnetic pickups. The vibrations of the instrument's ferrous metal strings within the magnetic field of the permanent magnets in magnetic [[pick up (music technology)|pickups]] produce small variations in the magnetic flux threading the coils of the pickups. This in turn produces small electrical voltages in the coils. Many bass players connect the signal from the bass guitar's pickups to a [[bass amplifier]] and loudspeaker using a 1/4" [[patch cord]]. These low-level signals are then strengthened by the bass amp's [[preamplifier]] electronic circuits, and then amplified with the bass amp's [[power amplifier]] and played through [[speaker enclosure|one or more speaker(s) in a cabinet]].

[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]

Most basses have a volume [[potentiometer]] ("pot" or "knob"), which can be turned up or down, and a tone potentiometer, which rolls off the high frequencies when it is turned to the player's right. Some basses may also have a pickup selector control or switch, to select single-coil or humbucking pickups. Since the 1980s, basses are often available with battery-powered "active" electronics that boost the signal with a [[preamplifier]] and provide [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] controls to boost or cut bass and treble frequencies, or both. Some expensive basses have even more equalization options, such as bass, middle and treble.


[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual "J"-style pickups]]

[[File:Yamaha BB404F Fretless bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Yamaha BB404F, which has two passive single coil pickups]]

Many basses have just one pickup, typically a "P" or "MM" pickup, though single soapbars are not unheard of. Multiple pickups are also quite common, two of the most common configurations being two "J" pickups (as on the stock Fender Jazz), or a "P" near the neck and a "J" near the bridge (e.g., Fender Precision Bass Special, Fender Precision Bass Plus). A two-"soapbar" configuration is also very common, especially on basses by makes such as [[Ibanez]] and [[Yamaha]]. A combination of a J or other single-coil pickup at the neck and a Music Man-style humbucker in the bridge has become popular among boutique instrument builders, giving a very bright, focused tone that is good for jazz, funk and thumbstyle.

Some basses, particularly expensive boutique instruments or custom-made guitars, use more unusual pickup configurations. Examples include a soapbar and a "P" pickup (found on some Fender basses), bassist [[Stu Hamm]]'s "Urge" basses, which have a "P" pickup sandwiched between two "J" pickups, and some of funk bassist [[Bootsy Collins]]' custom basses, which had as many as five J pickups. Another unusual pickup configuration is found on some of the custom basses that [[shred guitar|virtuoso bassist]] [[Billy Sheehan]] uses, in which there is one humbucker at the neck and a split-coil pickup at the middle position.

The placement of the pickup greatly affects the sound, timbre and tone of the instrument. A pickup near the neck joint emphasizes the fundamental and low-order harmonics and thus produces a deeper, bassier sound, while a pickup near the bridge emphasizes higher-order harmonics and makes a "tighter" or "sharper" sound. Usually basses with multiple pickups allow blending of the output from the pickups, with electrical and acoustical interactions between the two pickups (such as partial phase cancellations) allowing a range of tonal and timbral effects.

The use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.

[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]

Like the [[electric guitar]], the electric bass guitar is almost always connected to an [[bass instrument amplification|amplifier and a speaker]] with a [[patch cord]] for live performances. Electric bassists use either a "combo" amplifier, which combines an amplifier and a speaker in a single cabinet, or an amplifier and one or more speaker cabinets (typically stacked, with the amplifier sitting on the speaker cabinets, leading to the term "half-stack" for one cabinet setups and "full stack" for two).

In most genres, a "clean" bass tone (without any amplifier-induced "overdrive" or "distortion") is desirable, and so while guitarists often prefer the more desirable distorted tones of tube-transistor amplifiers, bassists commonly use solid-state amplifier circuitry to achieve the necessary high output wattages with less weight than tubes (though smaller tubes can often still be found in the low-power "preamplifier" sections of the system, where they provide a warmer, smoother character to the bass tone for relatively little additional weight). A few all-tube bass amplifiers are still available, notably from the [[Ampeg]] brand.

In some cases, when the bass is used with large-scale [[Public address system|PA]] amplification, it is plugged into a [[DI unit|"DI"]] or "direct box", which routes the signal to the bass amp while also sending the signal directly into a [[mixing console]], and thence to the main and monitor speakers. When a recording of bass is being made, engineers may use a microphone set up in front of the amplifier's speaker cabinet for the amplified signal, a direct box signal that feeds the recording console, or a mix of both.

Various electronic [[bass effects]] such as [[preamplifier]]s, "stomp box"-style pedals and [[wikt:signal|signal]] processors and the configuration of the [[amplifier]] and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] can be used to alter the basic sound of the instrument. In the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), signal processors such as [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]], [[Distortion (music)|overdrive]] devices (sometimes referred to as "[[fuzz bass]]"), and [[Audio level compression|compressors]] or [[limiter]]s became increasingly popular. Modulation effects like chorus, flanging, phase shifting, and time effects such as delay and looping are less commonly used with bass than with electric guitar, but they are used in some styles of music.

Most bass players stand while playing, using a strap over the shoulder to hold the instrument, although sitting is also accepted, particularly in large ensemble settings, such as jazz [[big band]]s or in acoustic genres such as [[folk music]]. Some bassists, such as [[Jah Wobble]], alternate between standing or seated playing. It is a matter of the player's preference as to which position gives the greatest ease of playing and what a [[bandleader]] expects. When sitting, right-handed players can balance the instrument on the right thigh or like classical guitar players, the left. When sitting, no strap is required. Balancing the bass on the left thigh usually positions it in such a way that it mimics the standing position, allowing for less difference between the standing and sitting positions. Balancing the bass on the right thigh provides better access to the neck and fretboard in its entirety, especially the lower-pitched frets.

In contrast to the [[upright bass]] (also called "double bass"), the electric bass guitar is played horizontally across the body, like an electric guitar. When the strings are plucked with the fingers ([[pizzicato]]), the index and middle fingers (and sometimes the thumb, ring, and little fingers as well) are used. [[James Jamerson]], an influential bassist from the [[Motown]] era, played intricate bass lines using only his index finger, which he called "The Hook." There are also variations in how a bassist chooses to rest the right-hand thumb (or left thumb in the case of left-handed players). A player may rest his or her thumb on the top edge of one of the pickups or on the side of the fretboard, which is especially common among bassists who have an upright bass influence. Some bassists anchor their thumbs on the lowest string and move it off the lowest string when they need to play on the low string. Alternatively, the thumb can be rested loosely on the strings to mute the unused strings.

The string can be plucked (or picked) at any point between the bridge and the point where the fretting hand is holding down the string on the fingerboard; different [[timbre]]s (tones) are produced depending on where along the string it is plucked. When plucked closer to the bridge, the string's harmonics are more pronounced, giving a brighter tone. Closer to the middle of the string, these harmonics are less pronounced, giving a more mellow, darker tone.

Bassists trying to emulate the sound of a double bass sometimes pluck the strings with their thumb and use [[palm mute|palm-muting]] to create a short, "thumpy" tone. [[Monk Montgomery]] (who played in [[Lionel Hampton]]'s [[big band]]) and [[Bruce Palmer]] (who performed with [[Buffalo Springfield]]) use thumb downstrokes. The use of the thumb was acknowledged by early Fender models, which came with a "thumbrest" or "Tug Bar" attached to the pickguard below the strings. Contrary to its name, this was not used to rest the thumb, but to provide leverage while using the thumb to pluck the strings. The thumbrest was moved above the strings in 1970s models (as a true thumbrest) and eliminated in the 1980s. Nevertheless, some reissued versions of vintage Fender basses in the 2010s do include a thumbrest.

[[File:Typical form of a slapping hand in a bass.jpg|thumb|right|The slap and pop technique]]

The [[Slapping (music)|slap and pop]] method, or "thumbstyle", most associated with [[funk music|funk]], uses tones and percussive sounds achieved by striking, thumping, or "slapping" a string with the thumb and snapping (or "popping") a string or strings with the index or middle fingers. Bassists often interpolate left hand-muted "[[dead note]]s" (also called "ghost notes") between the slaps and pops to achieve a rapid percussive effect, and after a note is slapped or popped, the fretting hand may cause other notes to sound by using "[[hammer on]]s", "[[pull off]]s", or a left-hand [[glissando]] (slide). [[Larry Graham]] of [[Sly and the Family Stone]] and [[Graham Central Station]] was an early innovator of the slap style, and [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis Johnson]] of [[The Brothers Johnson]] is also credited as an early slap bass player.

Slap and pop style is also used by many bassists in other genres, such as rock (e.g., [[J J Burnel]] and [[Les Claypool]]), metal (e.g., [[Eric Langlois]], [[Martin Mendez]], [[Fieldy]] and [[Ryan Martinie]]), and [[jazz fusion]] (e.g., [[Marcus Miller]], [[Victor Wooten]] and [[Alain Caron (bass player)|Alain Caron]]). Slap style playing was popularized throughout the 1980s and early 1990s by pop bass players such as [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]] (from [[Level 42]]) and rock bassists such as with [[Pino Palladino]] (currently a member of the [[John Mayer Trio]] and bassist for [[The Who]]), [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] (from the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]) and [[Alex Katunich]] (from [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]). [[Spank bass]] developed from the slap and pop style and treats the electric bass as a percussion instrument, striking the strings above the pickups with an open palmed hand. Wooten popularized the "double thump," in which the string is slapped twice, on the upstroke and a downstroke (for more information, see [[Classical Thump]]). A rarely used playing technique related to slapping is the use of wooden [[dowel]] "[[funk fingers]]", an approach popularized by [[Tony Levin]].

The [[Guitar pick|pick]] (or [[plectrum]]) is used to obtain a more articulate attack, for speed, or just personal preference. Although the use of a pick is primarily associated with [[rock music|rock]] and [[punk rock]], picks are also used in other styles. Jazz bassist [[Steve Swallow]] often plays with a pick, while [[Pink Floyd]] bassist [[Roger Waters]] uses one for a heavier tone. [[Mike Gordon]] of [[Phish]] uses a pick while also incorporating slapping techniques into his playing. Picks can be used with alternating downstrokes and upstrokes, or with all downstrokes for a more consistent attack. The pick is usually held with the index and thumb, with the up-and-down plucking motion supplied by the wrist.

There are many varieties of picks available, but due to the thicker, heavier strings of the electric bass, bassists tend to use heavier picks than those used for electric guitar, typically ranging from 1.14 mm–3.00 mm (3.00 is unusual). Different materials are used for picks, including plastic, nylon, rubber, and felt, all of which produce different tones. Felt and rubber picks are used to emulate a fingerstyle tone.

Palm-muting is a widely used bass technique. The outer edge of the palm of the picking hand is rested on the bridge while picking, and "mutes" the strings, shortening the sustain time. The harder the palm presses, or the more string area that is contacted by the palm, the shorter the string's sustain. The sustain of the picked note can be varied for each note or phrase. The shorter sustain of a muted note on an electric bass can be used to imitate the shorter sustain and character of an upright bass. Palm-muting is commonly done while using a pick, but can also be done without a pick, as when doing down-strokes with the thumb.

One prominent example of the pick/palm-muting combination is [[Paul McCartney]], who has consistently used this technique for decades. [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] also uses palm-muting; but often does so without a pick, using the thumb and first finger to pluck.
[[File:Paul McCartney live in Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|Paul McCartney mutes strings with picking hand]]

The fretting hand, the left hand for right-handed bass players and the right hand for left-handed bass players, is used to press down the strings to play different notes and shape the tone or timbre of a plucked or picked note. One technique used in the fretting hand is known as "a finger per fret", where each finger in the fretting hand plays one fret in a given position. Also, the double bass-style technique can be used for fretting. This technique involves the use of four fingers in the space of three frets, especially in the lower positions (i.e., the fretting positions closer to the nut, where the space between notes is the widest). When considering the spacing between notes, this is a comfortable distance for the average person's hand size. The main advantage of the "four fingers in three frets" technique is less tendon strain, leading to a diminished likelihood of [[Repetitive Strain Injury]] (RSI). The "four-in-three" technique is demonstrated in the image below (a bassist performing tapping).

The fretting hand can be used to change a sounded note, either by fully muting it after it is plucked or picked to shorten its duration or by partially muting it near the bridge to reduce the volume of the note, or make the note die away faster. The fretting hand is often used to mute strings that are not being played and stop the sympathetic vibrations, particularly when the player wants a "dry" or "focused" sound. On the other hand, the sympathetic resonance of harmonically related strings may be desired for some songs, such as ballads. In these cases, a bassist can fret harmonically related notes. For example, while fretting a sustained "F" (on the third fret of the "D" string), underneath an F major chord being played by a piano player, a bassist might hold down the "C" and low "F" below this note so their harmonics sound sympathetically.

The fretting hand can add [[vibrato]] to a plucked or picked note, either a gentle, narrow vibrato or a more exaggerated, wide vibrato with bigger pitch variations. For fretted basses, vibrato is always an alternation between the pitch of the note and a slightly higher pitch. For fretless basses, the player can use this style of vibrato, or they can alternate between the note and a slightly lower pitch, as is done with the [[double bass]] and on other [[string section|unfretted stringed instruments]]. While vibrato is mostly done on [[stopped note|"stopped" notes]]—that is, notes that are pressed down on the fingerboard—open strings can also be vibratoed by pressing down on the string behind the nut. As well, the fretting hand can be used to "bend" a plucked or picked note up in pitch, by pushing or pulling the string so that the note sounds at a higher pitch. To create the opposite effect, a "bend down", the string is pushed to a higher pitch before being plucked or picked and then allowed to fall to the lower, regular pitch after it is sounded. Though rare, some bassists may use a [[tremolo bar]]-equipped bass to produce the same effect.

In addition to pressing down one note at a time, bassists can also press down several notes at one time with their fretting hand to perform a [[double stop]] (two notes at once) or a chord. While double stops and chords are used less often by bassists than by electric guitarists playing [[rhythm guitar]], a variety of double stops and chords can be performed on the electric bass. Some double stops used by bassists include [[octave]]s. Chords can be especially with effective on instruments with higher ranges such as six-string basses. Another variation to fully pressing down a string is to gently graze the string with the finger at the [[harmonic]] node points on the string, which creates chime-like upper partials (also called "overtones"). [[Glissando]] is an effect in which the fretting hand slides up or down the neck, which can be used to create a slide in pitch up or down. A subtle glissando can be performed by moving the fretting hand without plucking or picking the string; for a more pronounced effect, the string is plucked or picked first, or, in a metal or [[hardcore punk]] context, a pick may be scraped along the sides of the lower strings.

[[File:Bass Guitar Tapping.JPG|thumb|right|The tapping technique]]

The fretting hand can also be used to sound notes, either by [[pizzicato|plucking an open string]] with the fretting hand, or, in the case of a string that has already been plucked or picked, by [[hammer on|"hammering on"]] a higher pitch or [[pull off|"pulling off"]] a finger to pluck a lower fretted or open stringed note. Jazz bassists use a subtle form of fretting hand pizzicato by plucking a very brief open string [[grace note]] with the fretting hand right before playing the string with the plucking hand. When a string is rapidly hammered on, the note can be prolonged into a [[trill (music)|trill]].

In the two-handed [[tapping]] styles, bassists use both hands to play notes on the fretboard by rapidly pressing and holding the string to the fret. Instead of plucking or picking the string to create a sound, in this technique, the action of striking the string against the fret or the fretboard creates the sound. Since two hands can be used to play on the fretboard, this makes it possible to play interweaving [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] lines, to simultaneously play a bass line and a simple chord, or play [[Guitar chord|chords]] and arpeggios. Bassist [[John Entwistle]] of [[The Who]] tapped percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a twangy sound to create drum-style [[fill (music)|fills]]. Players noted for this technique include [[Cliff Burton]], [[Billy Sheehan]], [[Stuart Hamm]], [[John Myung]], [[Victor Wooten]], [[Les Claypool]], [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]], and [[Michael Manring]]. The [[Chapman Stick]] and [[Warr Guitar]]s are string instruments specifically designed to be played using two-handed tapping.

[[Strum]]ming, usually with finger nails, is a common technique on [[acoustic guitar]], but it is not a commonly used technique for bass. However, a notable example is [[Stanley Clarke]]'s bass playing on the introduction to "School Days", on the [[School Days (album)|album of the same name]].

[[Popular music]] bands and rock groups use the bass guitar as a member of the [[rhythm section]], which provides the [[chord (music)|chord]] sequence or "[[Chord progression|progression]]" and sets out the "[[beat (music)|beat]]" for the song. The rhythm section typically consists of a [[rhythm guitar]]ist or [[electric keyboard]] player, or both, a bass guitarist and a [[drummer]]; larger groups may add additional guitarists, keyboardists, or percussionists.

Bassists often play a bass line composed by an [[arranger]], [[songwriter]] or [[composer]] of a song—or, in the case of a [[cover song]], the bass line from the original. In other bands—e.g., jazz-rock bands that play from [[lead sheet]]s and country bands using the [[Nashville number system]]—bassists are expected to improvise or prepare their own part to fit the song's chord progression and rhythmic style.

[[File:Pop bassline.ogg|thumb|right|A simple pop bass line over a D major progression]]

Types of bass lines vary widely, depending on musical style. However, the bass guitarist generally fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework (often by emphasizing the roots of the chord progression) and laying down the beat in collaboration with the drummer and other [[rhythm section]] instruments. The importance of the bass guitarist and the bass line varies in different styles of music. In some pop styles, such as 1980s-era pop and musical theater, the bass sometimes plays a relatively simple part as the music emphasizes vocals and melody instruments. In contrast, in [[reggae]], funk, or hip-hop, entire songs may center on the bass groove, and the bass line is usually prominent in the mix.

In traditional music such as [[country music]], [[folk rock]], and related styles, the bass often plays the roots and fifth (typically the fifth below the root) of each chord in alternation. In these styles, bassists often use scalar "walkups" or "walkdowns" when there is a chord change. In Chicago [[blues]], the electric bass often performs a [[walking bass]]line made up of scales and arpeggios. In [[blues rock]] bands, the bassist often plays [[blues scale]]-based riffs and chugging [[boogie]]-style lines. In [[heavy metal bass|metal]], the bass guitar may perform complex [[riff]]s along with the rhythm guitarist or play a low, rumbling [[pedal point]] to anchor the group's sound.

[[File:Blues bassline played with a pick.ogg|thumb|right|A blues bass line played with a pick]]

The bass guitarist sometimes breaks out of the strict rhythm section role to perform [[bass run|bass breaks]] or bass solos. The types of bass lines used for bass breaks or bass solos vary by style. In a rock band, a bass break may consist of the bassist playing a [[riff]] or [[lick (music)|lick]] during a pause in the song. In some styles of metal, a bass break may consist of "[[shred guitar]]"-style [[tapping]] on the bass. In a [[funk]] or funk rock band, a bass solo may showcase the bassist's percussive [[slap and pop]] playing. In genres such as [[progressive rock]], [[art rock]], or [[progressive metal]], the bass guitar player may play [[melody]] lines along with the [[lead guitar]] (or vocalist) and perform extended [[guitar solo]]s.

Chords are not used that often by electric bass players. However, in some styles, bassists may sound "double stops", such as octaves with open strings and powerchords. In Latin music, double stops with fifths are used. [[Robert Trujillo]] of [[Metallica]] is known for playing "massive chords" and "chord-based harmonics" on the bass. [[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]] often played [[power chord]]s in his bass lines.

While bass guitar solos are not common in popular music, some artists, particularly in the heavy metal, funk, and progressive rock genres, do utilize them. In a rock context, bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections.

Bass solos are performed using a range of different techniques, such as plucking or fingerpicking. In the 1960s, [[The Who]]'s bassist, [[John Entwistle]], performed a [[bass run|bass break]] on the song "[[My Generation (The Who song)|My Generation]]" using a [[plectrum]]. He originally intended to use his fingers, but could not put his plectrum down quickly enough. This is considered as one of the first bass solos in rock music, and also one of the most recognizable. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Good Times Bad Times]]", the first song on their [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]], contains two brief bass solos, occurring after the song's first and third choruses. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s bassist, [[John Deacon]], occasionally played bass solos, such as on the song "[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]". [[Metallica]]'s 1983 debut "[[Kill Em All]]" includes the song "[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]," consisting entirely of a bass solo played by [[Cliff Burton]]. [[John McVie]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] performed a bass solo on "[[The Chain]]" from the 1977 "[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]" album.

[[Manowar]]'s bassist [[Joey DeMaio]] uses special [[piccolo bass]] for his extremely fast bass solos like "Sting of the Bumblebee" and "William's Tale". [[Green Day]] bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] played a bass solo on the song "Welcome To Paradise" from the 1994 album "[[Dookie]]" and on the song "Makeout Party" from the 2012 album "[[¡Dos!]]". [[U2]] includes a bass solo most notably on "[[Gloria (U2 song)|Gloria]]", in which [[Adam Clayton]] utilizes several playing techniques. Matt Freeman of Rancid performs a very fast, guitar-like bass solo in the song "Maxwell Murder". [[Blink-182]]'s "Voyeur" has a bass solo, which is featured on both their studio album "[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]" & their live album "[[The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)]]".

Heavy metal bass players such as [[Geezer Butler]] ([[Black Sabbath]]), [[Alex Webster]] ([[Cannibal Corpse]]), Cliff Burton (Metallica), and [[Les Claypool]] ([[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Blind Illusion]]) have used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. [[Geddy Lee]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] has made frequent use of bass solos, such as on the instrumental "[[YYZ (song)|YYZ]]". In both published [[Van Halen]] concert videos, [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]] performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. Funk bassists such as [[Larry Graham]] began using slapping and popping techniques for their solos, which coupled a percussive thumb-slapping technique of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings, often in rhythmic alternation. The [[slapping and popping]] technique incorporates a large number of muted (or 'ghost' tones) to normal notes to add to the rhythmic effect. Slapping and popping solos were prominent in 1980s pop and R&B, and they are still used by some modern funk and Latin bands.

When playing bass solos, rock and metal bassists sometimes use [[Effects unit|effects]] such as [[fuzz bass]] or a [[wah-wah pedal]] to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both effects. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums.

The electric bass is a relative newcomer to the world of [[jazz]]. The [[big band]]s of the 1930s and 1940s [[Swing music|Swing]] era and the small combos of the 1950s [[Bebop]] and [[Hard Bop]] movements all used the [[double bass]]. The electric bass was introduced in some bands in the 1950s and it became prominent during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when rock influences were blended with jazz to create [[jazz-rock fusion]].

[[File:Walkingbass.png|thumb|right|A walking bass line]]

The introduction of the electric bass in jazz fusion, as in the rock world, helped bassists play in high-volume stadium concerts with powerful amplifiers, because it is easier to amplify the electric bass than the double bass (the latter is prone to feedback in high-volume settings). The electric bass has both an accompaniment and a soloing role in [[jazz]]. In accompaniment, the bassist may perform [[walking bass]]lines for traditional tunes and [[jazz standard]]s, playing smooth quarter note lines that imitate the double bass. It is called a "walking bass line" because of the way it rises and falls using scale notes and passing notes.

For [[Latin music|Latin]] or [[salsa music|salsa]] tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, the electric bass may play rapid, syncopated rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove.

In a jazz setting, the electric bass tends to have a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles. In most rock settings, the bass guitarist may only have a few short bass breaks or brief solos during a concert. During a jazz concert, a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos, which are called "blowing" in jazz parlance. Whether a jazz bassist is comping (accompanying) or soloing, they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and "timefeel" that creates a sense of "[[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]]" and "[[groove (music)|groove]]". For information on notable jazz bassists, see the [[List of jazz bassists]] article.

[[Contemporary classical music]] uses both the standard instruments of Western Art music (piano, violin, double bass, etc.) and newer instruments or sound producing devices, ranging from electrically amplified instruments to tape players and radios.

The electric bass guitar has occasionally been used in contemporary classical music (art music) since the late 1960s. Contemporary composers often obtained unusual sounds or instrumental timbres through the use of non-traditional (or unconventional) instruments or playing techniques. As such, bass guitarists playing contemporary classical music may be instructed to pluck or strum the instrument in unusual ways.

However, contemporary classical composers may also write for the bass guitar in order to utilise its unique sound, and in particular its precise and piercing attack and timbre. For example, [[Steve Reich]], explaining his decision to score [[2x5 (Reich)|2x5]] for two bass guitars, stated that "[with electric bass guitars] you can have interlocking bass lines, which on an acoustic bass, played pizzicato, would be mud".

[[File:Alfred Schnittke April 6 1989 Moscow.jpg|thumb|right|Russian and Soviet composer [[Alfred Schnittke]]]]

American composers using electric bass in the 1960s included experimental classical music composer [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]] (born 1934) ("Electric Spring 1", 1966; "Electric Spring 2", 1966/70; "Electric Spring 3", 1967; and "Untitled", 1996); [[Francis Thorne]], a student of Paul Hindemith at Yale University (born 1922), who wrote ("Liebesrock" 1968–69); and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] (Cello Concerto no. 1, 1966/67, rev. 1971/72), "[[The Devils of Loudun (opera)|The Devils of Loudun]]", 1969; "Kosmogonia", 1970; and "Partita", 1971), [[Louis Andriessen]] ("Spektakel", 1970; "De Staat", 1972–76; "Hoketus", 1976; "De Tijd", 1980–81 and "[[De Materie]]", 1984–1988). European composers who began scoring for the bass guitar in the 1960s included Danish composer [[Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen]] (born 1932) ("Symfoni på Rygmarven", 1966; "Rerepriser", 1967; and "Piece by Piece", 1968); [[Irwin Bazelon]] ("Churchill Downs", 1970).

In the 1970s, electric bass was used by the American conductor-composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] (1918–1990) for his "[[Mass (Bernstein)|MASS]]" (1971). American jazz pianist [[Dave Brubeck]] used bass guitar for his 1971 piece "Truth Has Fallen". [[Russia]]n and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] composer [[Alfred Schnittke]] used the instrument for his [[Symphony No. 1 (Schnittke)|Symphony No. 1]] (1972). In 1977, [[David Amram]] (born 1930) scored for electric bass in "En memoria de Chano Pozo". Amram is an American composer known for his eclectic use of jazz, ethnic and folk music.

In the 1980s (and in following decades), electric bass was used in works by [[Hans Werner Henze]] ("El Rey de Harlem", 1980; and "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria", 1981), [[Harold Shapero]], "On Green Mountain (Chaconne after Monteverdi)", 1957, orchestrated 1981; Alfred Schnittke's [[Symphony No. 3 (Schnittke)|Symphony No. 3]] (1981); [[Steve Reich]]'s "[[Electric Counterpoint]]" (1987) and [[2x5 (Reich)|2x5]] (2008), [[Wolfgang Rihm]] ("Die Eroberung von Mexico", 1987–91), [[Arvo Pärt]] ("Miserere", 1989/92), [[Steve Martland]] ("Dance works", 1993; and "Horses of Instruction", 1994), [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] ("Aus dem Stundenbuch", 1991), [[Giya Kancheli]] ("Wingless", 1993), [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] ("[[I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky]]", 1995; and "Scratchband", 1996/97), [[Michael Nyman]] (various works for the [[Michael Nyman Band]]), [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]] ("Blood on the Floor", 1993–1996), numerous works by [[Art Jarvinen]].

The pedagogy and training for the electric bass varies widely by genre and country. Rock and pop bass has a history of pedagogy dating back to the 1950s and 1960s, when method books were developed to help students learn the instrument. One notable method book was [[Carol Kaye]]'s "How to Play the Electric Bass".

In the jazz scene, since the bass guitar takes on much of the same role as the double bass—laying down the rhythm, and outlining the harmonic foundation—electric bass players have long used both bass guitar methods and jazz double bass method books. The use of jazz double bass method books by electric bass players in jazz is facilitated in that jazz methods tend to emphasize improvisation techniques (e.g., how to improvise [[walking bass]]lines) and rhythmic exercises rather than specific ways of holding or plucking the instrument.

Of all of the genres, jazz and the mainstream commercial genres (rock, R&B, etc.) have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training for electric bass. In the jazz scene, teens can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in amateur big bands at high schools or run by the community. Young adults who aspire to becoming professional jazz bassists or studio rock bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges and some universities.

Several colleges offer electric bass training in the US. The Bass Institute of Technology (BIT) in Los Angeles was founded in 1978, as part of the Musician's Institute. [[Chuck Rainey]] (electric bassist for [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Marvin Gaye]]) was BIT's first director. BIT was one of the earliest professional training program for electric bassists. The program teaches a range of modern styles, including funk, rock, jazz, Latin, and R&B.

The [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston offers training for electric bass players. Electric bass students get private lessons and there is a choice of over 270 ensembles to play in. Specific electric bass courses include funk/fusion styles for bass; slap techniques for electric bass; fingerstyle R&B; five- and six-string electric bass playing (including performing chords); and how to read bass sheet music. Berklee College alumni include [[Jeff Andrews]], [[Victor Bailey (musician)|Victor Bailey]], [[Jeff Berlin]], [[Michael Manring]], and [[Neil Stubenhaus]]. The Bass Department has two rooms with bass amps for classes and ten private lesson studios equipped with audio recording gear. Berklee offers instruction for the four-, five-, and six-string electric bass, the fretless bass, and double bass. "Students learn concepts in Latin, funk, Motown, and hip-hop, ... jazz, rock, and fusion."

In Canada, the [[Humber College]] Institute of Technology & Advanced Learning offers an Advanced Diploma (a three-year program) in jazz and commercial music. The program accepts performers who play bass, guitar, keyboard, drums, melody instruments (e.g., saxophone, flute, violin) and who sing. Students get private lessons and perform in 40 student ensembles.

Although there are far fewer university programs that offer electric bass instruction in jazz and popular music, some universities offer bachelor's degrees ([[B.Mus.]]) and Master of Music ([[M.Mus.]]) degrees in jazz performance or "commercial music", where electric bass can be the main instrument. In the US, the [[Manhattan School of Music]] has a jazz program leading to B.Mus. and M.Mus degrees that accepts students who play bass (double bass and electric bass), guitar, piano, drums, and melody instruments (e.g., saxophone, trumpet, etc.).

In the Australian state of Victoria, the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority has set out minimum standards for its electric bass students doing their end-of-year Solo performance recital. To graduate, students must perform pieces and songs from a set list that includes Baroque suite movements that were originally written for cello, 1960s Motown tunes, 1970s fusion jazz solos, and 1980s slap bass tunes. A typical program may include a Prelude by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]; "Portrait of Tracy" by [[Jaco Pastorius]]; "[[Twisted (Annie Ross song)|Twisted]]" by [[Wardell Gray]] and [[Annie Ross]]; "What's Going On" by [[James Jamerson]]; and the funky Disco hit "[[Le Freak]]" by Chic.

In addition to college and university diplomas and degrees, there are a variety of other training programs such as jazz or funk summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to play a wide range of contemporary music, from 1970s-style jazz-rock fusion to 2000s-style R&B.

In other less mainstream genres, such as hardcore punk or metal, the pedagogical systems and training sequences are typically not formalized and institutionalized. As such, many players learn by ear, by copying bass lines from records and CDs, and by playing in a number of bands. Even in non-mainstream styles, though, students may be able to take lessons from experts in these or other styles, adapting learned techniques to their own style. As well, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s, instructional DVDs (e.g., how to play metal bass). In the 2010s, many instructional videos are available online on video-sharing websites such as [[YouTube]].
