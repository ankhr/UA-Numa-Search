Basketball

Basketball is a limited contact <a href="sport">sport</a> played on a rectangular <a href="Basketball%20court">court</a>. While most often played as a <a href="team%20sport">team sport</a> with five players on each side, three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. The objective is to <a href="%23Shooting">shoot</a> a <a href="basketball%20%28ball%29">ball</a> through a hoop in diameter and high that is mounted to a <a href="Backboard%20%28basketball%29">backboard</a> at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by <a href="Dr.%20James%20Naismith">Dr. James Naismith</a>.

A team can score a <a href="Field%20goal%20%28basketball%29">field goal</a> by shooting the ball through the basket being defended by the opposition team during regular play. A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the <a href="3%20point%20line">three-point line</a>, and two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via <a href="free%20throw">free throw</a>s, which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) is mandated when the score is tied at the end of regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by passing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). It is a violation to <a href="Traveling%20%28basketball%29">lift, or drag, one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball</a>, to <a href="Carrying%20%28basketball%29">carry</a> it, or to <a href="double%20dribble">hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling</a>.

The game has many individual techniques for displaying skill—ball-handling, shooting, passing, dribbling, dunking, shot-blocking, and rebounding. Basketball teams generally have <a href="Basketball%20position">player positions</a>, the tallest and strongest members of a team are called a <a href="Center%20%28basketball%29">center</a> or <a href="Power%20forward%20%28basketball%29">power forward</a>, while slightly shorter and more agile players are called <a href="small%20forward">small forward</a>, and the shortest players or those who possess the best ball handling skills are called a <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a> or <a href="shooting%20guard">shooting guard</a>. The point guard directs the on court action of the team, implementing the coach's game plan, and managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning).

Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. The <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA) is the most popular and widely considered to be the highest level of <a href="professional%20basketball">professional basketball</a> in the world and NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player. Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the <a href="Euroleague">Euroleague</a> and <a href="FIBA%20Americas%20League">FIBA Americas League</a>. The <a href="FIBA%20Basketball%20World%20Cup">FIBA Basketball World Cup</a> attracts the top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like <a href="EuroBasket">EuroBasket</a> and <a href="FIBA%20Americas%20Championship">FIBA Americas Championship</a>.

The <a href="FIBA%20Women%27s%20Basketball%20World%20Cup">FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup</a> features the top national <a href="women%27s%20basketball">women's basketball</a> teams from continental championships. The main North American league is the <a href="WNBA">WNBA</a>, whereas the <a href="EuroLeague%20Women">EuroLeague Women</a> has been dominated by teams from the <a href="Russian%20Women%27s%20Basketball%20Premier%20League">Russian Women's Basketball Premier League</a>.

In early December 1891, <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> Dr. <a href="James%20Naismith">James Naismith</a>, a physical education professor and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (<a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>) (today, <a href="Springfield%20College">Springfield College</a>) in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long <a href="New%20England">New England</a> winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in <a href="gymnasiums">gymnasiums</a>, he wrote the basic <a href="rules%20of%20basketball">rules</a> and nailed a <a href="peach">peach</a> basket onto a elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long <a href="dowel">dowel</a> each time.

Basketball was originally played with a <a href="Football%20%28association%20football%29">soccer ball</a>. These round balls from "association football" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in. These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable. Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith. (Whereas in <a href="American%20football">American football</a>, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.) The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that <a href="Paul%20D.%20%26quot%3BTony%26quot%3B%20Hinkle">Tony Hinkle</a>, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game around the 1950s, as manufacturing improved the ball shape.

The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game. The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots. Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called "<a href="Duck%20on%20a%20Rock">Duck on a Rock</a>", as many had failed before it.

Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game. Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started. Mahan suggested that it be called "Naismith ball", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game. Mahan then said, "Why not call it basketball?" Naismith replied, "We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it." The first official game was played in the <a href="Young%20Men%27s%20Christian%20Association%20Building%20%28Albany%2C%20New%20York%29">YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York</a>, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from , on a court just half the size of a present-day <a href="Streetball">Streetball</a> or <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA) court.

At the time, football was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11). When winter weather got too icy to play football, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side. By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.

Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the USA and Canada. By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While the YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the YMCA's primary mission. However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the <a href="Amateur%20Athletic%20Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a> and the <a href="Intercollegiate%20Athletic%20Association%20of%20the%20United%20States">Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States</a> (forerunner of the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a>) vied for control over the rules for the game. The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league only lasted five years.

Dr. James Naismith was instrumental in establishing <a href="college%20basketball">college basketball</a>. His colleague C.O. Beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> <a href="Geneva%20College">Geneva College</a>. Naismith himself later coached at the <a href="University%20of%20Kansas">University of Kansas</a> for six years, before handing the reins to renowned coach <a href="Phog%20Allen">Forrest "Phog" Allen</a>. Naismith's disciple <a href="Amos%20Alonzo%20Stagg">Amos Alonzo Stagg</a> brought basketball to the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, while <a href="Adolph%20Rupp">Adolph Rupp</a>, a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at the <a href="Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">University of Kentucky</a>. On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at <a href="Hamline%20University">Hamline University</a> between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>. The School of Agriculture won in a 9–3 game.

In 1901, colleges, including the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a>, <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">U.S. Naval Academy</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20Boulder">University of Colorado</a> and <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> began sponsoring men's games. In 1905, frequent injuries on the <a href="College%20football">football</a> field prompted <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). In 1910, that body would change its name to the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA). The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston, Ontario</a> on February 6, 1904, when <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a> visited <a href="Queen%27s%20University">Queen's University</a>. McGill won 9–7 in overtime; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome. A good turnout of spectators watched the game.

The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics">National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA) <a href="NAIA%20national%20men%27s%20basketball%20championship">tournament</a>, was organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the <a href="National%20Invitation%20Tournament">National Invitation Tournament</a> (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship">NCAA national tournament</a> would begin one year later. College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in <a href="match%20fixing">match fixing</a> and <a href="point%20shaving">point shaving</a>. Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament.

Before widespread <a href="school%20district">school district</a> consolidation, most American high schools were far smaller than their present-day counterparts. During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements. In the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America. Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's <a href="Franklin%20Wonder%20Five">Franklin Wonder Five</a>, which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition.

Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in <a href="Varsity%20team">varsity</a> competition. Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation. In the 2003–04 season, 1,002,797 boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the <a href="National%20Federation%20of%20State%20High%20School%20Associations">National Federation of State High School Associations</a>. The states of <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> and <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> are particularly well known for their residents' devotion to high school basketball, commonly called <a href="Hoosier%20Hysteria">Hoosier Hysteria</a> in Indiana; the critically acclaimed film "<a href="Hoosiers">Hoosiers</a>" shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities.

There is currently no tournament to determine a national high school champion. The most serious effort was the National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> from 1917 to 1930. The event was organized by <a href="Amos%20Alonzo%20Stagg">Amos Alonzo Stagg</a> and sent invitations to state champion teams. The tournament started out as a mostly Midwest affair but grew. In 1929 it had 29 state champions. Faced with opposition from the <a href="National%20Federation%20of%20State%20High%20School%20Associations">National Federation of State High School Associations</a> and <a href="North%20Central%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930. The organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks. The tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools.

The National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at <a href="Loyola%20University%20Chicago">Loyola University</a>. The National Catholic Invitational Basketball Tournament from 1954 to 1978 played at a series of venues, including <a href="The%20Catholic%20University%20of%20America">Catholic University</a>, <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown</a> and <a href="George%20Mason%20University">George Mason</a>. The National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for Black High Schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at <a href="Hampton%20University">Hampton Institute</a>. The National Invitational Interscholastic Basketball Tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at <a href="Tuskegee%20University">Tuskegee Institute</a>. Following a pause during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> it resumed at <a href="Tennessee%20State%20University">Tennessee State College</a> in Nashville. The basis for the champion dwindled after 1954 when "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>" began an integration of schools. The last tournaments were held at <a href="Alabama%20State%20University">Alabama State College</a> from 1964 to 1967.

Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's <a href="professional%20basketball">professional basketball</a> teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. <a href="Barnstorm%20%28sports%29">Barnstorming</a> squads such as the <a href="Original%20Celtics">Original Celtics</a> and two all-African American teams, the <a href="New%20York%20Renaissance">New York Renaissance Five</a> ("Rens") and the (still existing) <a href="Harlem%20Globetrotters">Harlem Globetrotters</a> played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.

In 1946, the <a href="Basketball%20Association%20of%20America">Basketball Association of America</a> (BAA) was formed. The first game was played in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Ontario, Canada between the <a href="Toronto%20Huskies">Toronto Huskies</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Knicks">New York Knickerbockers</a> on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20%28United%20States%29">National Basketball League</a> (NBL) to form the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA). By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a <a href="Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">basketball hall of fame</a> was founded in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield</a>, Massachusetts, site of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the <a href="American%20Basketball%20Association">American Basketball Association</a>, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the <a href="ABA-NBA%20merger">ABA-NBA merger</a> in 1976. Today the NBA is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.

The NBA has featured many famous players, including <a href="George%20Mikan">George Mikan</a>, the first dominating "big man"; ball-handling wizard <a href="Bob%20Cousy">Bob Cousy</a> and defensive genius <a href="Bill%20Russell">Bill Russell</a> of the <a href="Boston%20Celtics">Boston Celtics</a>; charismatic center <a href="Wilt%20Chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a>, who originally played for the barnstorming <a href="Harlem%20Globetrotters">Harlem Globetrotters</a>; all-around stars <a href="Oscar%20Robertson">Oscar Robertson</a> and <a href="Jerry%20West">Jerry West</a>; more recent big men <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>, <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a>, <a href="Hakeem%20Olajuwon">Hakeem Olajuwon</a> and <a href="Karl%20Malone">Karl Malone</a>; playmakers <a href="John%20Stockton">John Stockton</a>, <a href="Isiah%20Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a> and <a href="Steve%20Nash">Steve Nash</a>; crowd-pleasing forwards <a href="Julius%20Erving">Julius Erving</a> and <a href="Charles%20Barkley">Charles Barkley</a>; European stars <a href="Dirk%20Nowitzki">Dirk Nowitzki</a>, <a href="Pau%20Gasol">Pau Gasol</a> and <a href="Tony%20Parker">Tony Parker</a>; more recent superstars <a href="LeBron%20James">LeBron James</a>, <a href="Allen%20Iverson">Allen Iverson</a> and <a href="Kobe%20Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: <a href="Larry%20Bird">Larry Bird</a>, <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Earvin "Magic" Johnson</a>, and <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>.

In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Development%20League">National Basketball Development League</a> (later known as the NBA D-League and then the <a href="NBA%20G%20League">NBA G League</a> after a branding deal with <a href="Gatorade">Gatorade</a>). As of the 2017–18 season, the G League has 26 teams.

<a href="FIBA">FIBA</a> (International Basketball Federation) was formed in 1932 by eight founding nations: Argentina, <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland. At this time, the organization only oversaw amateur players. Its acronym, derived from the French "Fédération Internationale de Basket-ball Amateur", was thus "FIBA". Men's basketball was first <a href="Basketball%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">included</a> at the Berlin <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a>, although a demonstration tournament was held in 1904. The United States defeated Canada in the first final, played outdoors. This competition has usually been dominated by the United States, whose team has won all but three titles. The first of these came in a controversial final game in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> in <a href="Basketball%20at%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics">1972</a> against the Soviet Union, in which the ending of the game was replayed three times until the Soviet Union finally came out on top. In 1950 the first FIBA World Championship for men, now known as the <a href="FIBA%20Basketball%20World%20Cup">FIBA Basketball World Cup</a>, was held in Argentina. Three years later, the first FIBA World Championship for Women, now known as the <a href="FIBA%20Women%27s%20Basketball%20World%20Cup">FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup</a>, was held in Chile. Women's basketball was added to the Olympics in 1976, which were held in <a href="Montreal">Montreal, Quebec</a>, Canada with teams such as the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Brazil%20women%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">Brazil</a> and <a href="Australia%20women%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">Australia</a> rivaling the <a href="United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">American</a> squads.

<a href="FIBA">FIBA</a> dropped the distinction between amateur and professional players in 1989, and in 1992, professional players played for the first time in the Olympic Games. The United States' dominance continued with the introduction of their <a href="1992%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">Dream Team</a>. In the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Athens Olympics</a>, the United States suffered its first Olympic loss while using professional players, falling to <a href="Puerto%20Rico%20national%20basketball%20team">Puerto Rico</a> (in a 19-point loss) and <a href="Lithuania%20men%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">Lithuania</a> in group games, and being eliminated in the semifinals by <a href="Argentina%20national%20basketball%20team">Argentina</a>. It eventually won the bronze medal defeating Lithuania, finishing behind Argentina and <a href="Italy%20national%20basketball%20team">Italy</a>. The "<a href="2008%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">Redeem Team</a>", won gold at the <a href="Basketball%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Olympics</a>, and the so-called "B-Team", won gold at the <a href="2010%20FIBA%20World%20Championship">2010 FIBA World Championship</a> in Turkey despite featuring no players from the 2008 squad. The United States continued its dominance as they won gold at the <a href="Basketball%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Olympics</a>, <a href="2014%20FIBA%20Basketball%20World%20Cup">2014 FIBA World Cup</a> and the <a href="Basketball%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Olympics</a>.

Worldwide, basketball tournaments are held for boys and girls of all age levels. The global popularity of the sport is reflected in the nationalities represented in the NBA. Players from all six inhabited continents currently play in the NBA. Top international players began coming into the NBA in the mid-1990s, including Croatians <a href="Dra%C5%BEen%20Petrovi%C4%87">Dražen Petrović</a> and <a href="Toni%20Kuko%C4%8D">Toni Kukoč</a>, Serbian <a href="Vlade%20Divac">Vlade Divac</a>, Lithuanians <a href="Arvydas%20Sabonis">Arvydas Sabonis</a> and <a href="%C5%A0ar%C5%ABnas%20Mar%C4%8Diulionis">Šarūnas Marčiulionis</a>, Dutchman <a href="Rik%20Smits">Rik Smits</a> and German <a href="Detlef%20Schrempf">Detlef Schrempf</a>.

In the Philippines, the <a href="Philippine%20Basketball%20Association">Philippine Basketball Association</a>'s first game was played on April 9, 1975 at the <a href="Araneta%20Coliseum">Araneta Coliseum</a> in <a href="Cubao">Cubao</a>, <a href="Quezon%20City">Quezon City</a>. Philippines. It was founded as a "rebellion" of several teams from the now-defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, which was tightly controlled by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (now defunct), the then-FIBA recognized national association. Nine teams from the MICAA participated in the league's first season that opened on April 9, 1975. The <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20Australia">NBL</a> is Australia's pre-eminent men's professional basketball league. The league commenced in <a href="1979%20NBL%20Season">1979</a>, playing a winter season (April–September) and did so until the completion of the 20th season in <a href="1998%20NBL%20Season">1998</a>. The <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NBL%20season">1998–99</a> season, which commenced only months later, was the first season after the shift to the current summer season format (October–April). This shift was an attempt to avoid competing directly against <a href="Football%20in%20Australia">Australia's various football codes</a>. It features 8 teams from around Australia and one in New Zealand. A few players including <a href="Luc%20Longley">Luc Longley</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Gaze">Andrew Gaze</a>, <a href="Shane%20Heal">Shane Heal</a>, <a href="Chris%20Anstey">Chris Anstey</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Bogut">Andrew Bogut</a> made it big internationally, becoming poster figures for the sport in Australia. The <a href="Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20League">Women's National Basketball League</a> began in 1981.

Women's basketball began in 1892 at <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a> when <a href="Senda%20Berenson">Senda Berenson</a>, a physical education teacher, modified Naismith's rules for women. Shortly after she was hired at Smith, she went to Naismith to learn more about the game. Fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach, she organized the first women's collegiate basketball game on March 21, 1893, when her Smith freshmen and sophomores played against one another. However, the first women's interinstitutional game was played in 1892 between the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a> and Miss Head's School. Berenson's rules were first published in 1899, and two years later she became the editor of <a href="Spalding%20%28sports%20equipment%29">A. G. Spalding</a>'s first Women's Basketball Guide. Berenson's freshmen played the sophomore class in the first women's intercollegiate basketball game at <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a>, March 21, 1893. The same year, <a href="Mount%20Holyoke">Mount Holyoke</a> and <a href="Sophie%20Newcomb%20College">Sophie Newcomb College</a> (coached by <a href="Clara%20Gregory%20Baer">Clara Gregory Baer</a>) women began playing basketball. By 1895, the game had spread to colleges across the country, including <a href="Wellesley%20College">Wellesley</a>, <a href="Vassar%20College">Vassar</a>, and <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr</a>. The first intercollegiate women's game was on April 4, 1896. <a href="Stanford%20Cardinal%20women%27s%20basketball">Stanford</a> women played <a href="California%20Golden%20Bears%20women%27s%20basketball">Berkeley</a>, 9-on-9, ending in a 2–1 Stanford victory.

Women's basketball development was more structured than that for men in the early years. In 1905, the Executive Committee on Basket Ball Rules (National Women's Basketball Committee) was created by the <a href="American%20Physical%20Education%20Association">American Physical Education Association</a>. These rules called for six to nine players per team and 11 officials. The <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Sports%20Federation">International Women's Sports Federation</a> (1924) included a women's basketball competition. 37 women's high school varsity basketball or state tournaments were held by 1925. And in 1926, the Amateur Athletic Union backed the first <a href="NAIA%20national%20women%27s%20basketball%20championship">national women's basketball championship</a>, complete with men's rules. The <a href="Edmonton%20Grads">Edmonton Grads</a>, a touring Canadian women's team based in <a href="Edmonton%2C%20Alberta">Edmonton, Alberta</a>, operated between 1915 and 1940. The Grads toured all over North America, and were exceptionally successful. They posted a record of 522 wins and only 20 losses over that span, as they met any team that wanted to challenge them, funding their tours from gate receipts. The Grads also shone on several exhibition trips to Europe, and won four consecutive exhibition Olympics tournaments, in 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936; however, women's basketball was not an official Olympic sport until 1976. The Grads' players were unpaid, and had to remain single. The Grads' style focused on team play, without overly emphasizing skills of individual players. The first women's <a href="Amateur%20Athletic%20Union">AAU</a> All-America team was chosen in 1929. Women's industrial leagues sprang up throughout the United States, producing famous athletes, including <a href="Babe%20Zaharias">Babe Didrikson</a> of the <a href="Golden%20Cyclones">Golden Cyclones</a>, and the <a href="All%20American%20Red%20Heads%20Team">All American Red Heads Team</a>, which competed against men's teams, using men's rules. By 1938, the women's national championship changed from a three-court game to <a href="6%20on%206%20Basketball">two-court game with six players per team</a>.

The NBA-backed <a href="Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20Association">Women's National Basketball Association</a> (WNBA) began in 1997. Though it had shaky attendance figures, several marquee players (<a href="Lisa%20Leslie">Lisa Leslie</a>, <a href="Diana%20Taurasi">Diana Taurasi</a>, and <a href="Candace%20Parker">Candace Parker</a> among others) have helped the league's popularity and level of competition. Other <a href="women%27s%20professional%20sports">professional women's basketball</a> leagues in the United States, such as the <a href="American%20Basketball%20League%20%281996%E2%80%9398%29">American Basketball League (1996–98)</a>, have folded in part because of the popularity of the WNBA. The WNBA has been looked at by many as a niche league. However, the league has recently taken steps forward. In June 2007, the WNBA signed a contract extension with <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>. The new television deal ran from 2009 to 2016. Along with this deal, came the first ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league. Over the eight years of the contract, "millions and millions of dollars" were "dispersed to the league's teams." In a March 12, 2009 article, <a href="NBA">NBA</a> commissioner <a href="David%20Stern">David Stern</a> said that in the bad economy, "the NBA is far less profitable than the WNBA. We're losing a lot of money among a large number of teams. We're budgeting the WNBA to break even this year."

Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this section.

The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or <a href="three-point%20field%20goal">three points</a> if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc from the basket in international games and in NBA games. A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made.

Games are played in four quarters of 10 (<a href="FIBA">FIBA</a>) or 12 minutes (NBA). College men's games use two 20-minute halves, college women's games use 10-minute quarters, and United States high school varsity games use 8 minute quarters. 15 minutes are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules and 10 minutes in United States high schools. <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Basketball">Overtime</a> periods are five minutes in length except for high school, which is four minutes in length. Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore, games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours.

Five players from each team may be on the court at one time. <a href="Substitution%20%28sport%29">Substitutions</a> are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped. Teams also have a coach, who oversees the development and strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers.

For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a <a href="jersey%20%28clothing%29">jersey</a> with a clearly visible number, unique within the team, printed on both the front and back. Players wear <a href="high-top">high-top</a> sneakers that provide extra ankle support. Typically, team names, players' names and, outside of North America, sponsors are printed on the uniforms.

A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the NBA) for a short meeting with the players, are allowed. They generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed.

The game is controlled by the <a href="Official%20%28basketball%29">officials</a> consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the NBA), one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials. For college, the NBA, and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court. The table officials are responsible for keeping track of each teams scoring, timekeeping, individual and team <a href="Personal%20foul%20%28basketball%29">fouls</a>, player substitutions, team <a href="possession%20arrow">possession arrow</a>, and the <a href="shot%20clock">shot clock</a>.

The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends. Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.
A regulation <a href="basketball%20court">basketball court</a> in international games is long and 49.2 feet (15 meters) wide. In the <a href="NBA">NBA</a> and <a href="NCAA">NCAA</a> the court is . Most courts have <a href="wood%20flooring">wood flooring</a>, usually constructed from <a href="maple">maple</a> planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension. The name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle.

The basket is a steel rim diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures and one basket is at each end of the court. The white outlined box on the backboard is high and wide. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly above the court and inside the baseline. While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height – a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting.

The size of the basketball is also regulated. For men, the official ball is in circumference (size 7, or a "295 ball") and weighs 22 oz (623.69 grams). If women are playing, the official basketball size is in circumference (size 6, or a "285 ball") with a weight of 20 oz (567 grams). In <a href="3x3%20%28basketball%29">3x3</a>, a formalized version of the halfcourt 3-on-3 game, a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size 6 ball but the weight of a size 7 ball is used in all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed teams).

The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).

The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession. The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds.

There are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an infraction known as <a href="traveling%20%28basketball%29">traveling</a>. Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling. A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name <a href="double%20dribble">double dribble</a>. Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing his hand on the bottom of the ball; doing so is known as <a href="Carrying%20%28basketball%29">carrying the ball</a>. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it. A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.

The ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the fist. For the offense, a violation of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds.

There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA, and <a href="U%20Sports">U Sports</a> (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the "<a href="key%20%28basketball%29">key</a>") (3 seconds). These rules are designed to promote more offense.

Basket interference, or goaltending is a violation charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot. This violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless it is obvious that the ball has no chance of entering the basket, if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim, or in the area extended upwards from the basket, or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot. When a defensive player is charged with goaltending, the basket is awarded. If an offensive player commits the infraction, the basket is cancelled. In either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team.

An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul. These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well. Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more <a href="free%20throw">free throw</a>s if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful. One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line from the basket.

The referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal, sometimes resulting in controversy. The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees.

There is a second category of fouls called <a href="technical%20foul">technical foul</a>s, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct. These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time. Repeated incidents can result in <a href="ejection%20%28sports%29">disqualification</a>. A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA). In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.

If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA, NCAA women's, and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league. In the US college men's game and high school games for both sexes, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made. This is called shooting "one-and-one". If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.

When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.

After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, the other team is said to be "in the bonus". On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading "Bonus" or "Penalty" with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team. (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.)

If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.

If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot. A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots, and a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot receives three shots.

If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point. In combination with a regular shot, this is called a "three-point play" or "four-point play" (or more colloquially, an "and one") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).

Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the early years of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. In more recent times specific positions evolved, but the current trend, advocated by many top coaches including <a href="Mike%20Krzyzewski">Mike Krzyzewski</a> is towards positionless basketball, where big guys are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it. Popular descriptions of positions include:

<a href="Point%20guard">Point guard</a> (often called the "1") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.

<a href="Shooting%20guard">Shooting guard</a> (the "2") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.

<a href="Small%20forward">Small forward</a> (the "3") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.

<a href="Power%20forward%20%28basketball%29">Power forward</a> (the "4"): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in <a href="man-to-man%20defense">man-to-man defense</a>).

<a href="Center%20%28basketball%29">Center</a> (the "5"): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.

The above descriptions are flexible. For most teams today, the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings, as do the power forward and center, who are often called post players. While most teams describe two players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center, on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations.

There are two main defensive strategies: "zone defense" and "man-to-man defense". In a <a href="zone%20defense">zone defense</a>, each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court. Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a trap. In a <a href="man-to-man%20defense">man-to-man defense</a>, each defensive player guards a specific opponent.

Offensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a "cut". A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a "<a href="screen%20%28basketball%29">screen</a>" or "pick". The two plays are combined in the "<a href="pick%20and%20roll">pick and roll</a>", in which a player sets a pick and then "rolls" away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.

Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.

Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket. A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a "follow-through". Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.

The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the "<a href="set%20shot%20%28basketball%29">set shot</a>" and the "<a href="Jump%20shot%20%28basketball%29">jump shot</a>". The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws, and in other circumstances while the jump shot is taken in mid-air, the ball released near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.

Another common shot is called the "<a href="lay-up">lay-up</a>". This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to "lay" the ball "up" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a "<a href="finger%20roll">finger roll</a>"). The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the "<a href="slam%20dunk">slam dunk</a>", in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket while touching it.

Another shot that is becoming common is the "circus shot". The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket. A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.

A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an "<a href="air%20ball">air ball</a>". A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a <a href="brick%20%28basketball%29">brick</a>. The "hang time" is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, lay-up or jump shot.

The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.

A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.

A staple pass is the "chest pass". The ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest. A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.

Another type of pass is the "bounce pass". Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.

The "overhead pass" is used to pass the ball over a defender. The ball is released while over the passer's head.

The "outlet pass" occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound. The next pass after the rebound is the "outlet pass".

The crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept. Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. This is called a "no-look pass".

Another advanced style of passing is the "behind-the-back pass", which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate. Although some players can perform such a pass effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.

Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand, and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.

When dribbling past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball. It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.

Good dribblers (or "ball handlers") tend to bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to "steal" the ball. Good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs, between their legs, and switch directions suddenly, making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against. This is called a crossover, which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling.

A skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the dribbling motion or <a href="peripheral%20vision">peripheral vision</a> to keep track of the ball's location. By not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her.

A block is performed when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as "<a href="goaltending">goaltending</a>". It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. Under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim. After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.

To block a shot, a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released. Thus, height can be an advantage in blocking. Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions. However, with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap, even shorter players can be effective shot blockers.

At the professional level, most male players are above and most women above . Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest players. Almost all forwards in the top men's pro leagues are or taller. Most centers are over tall. According to a survey given to all NBA teams, the average height of all NBA players is just under , with the average weight being close to . The tallest players ever in the NBA were <a href="Manute%20Bol">Manute Bol</a> and <a href="Gheorghe%20Mure%C8%99an">Gheorghe Mureșan</a>, who were both tall. The tallest current NBA player is <a href="Sim%20Bhullar">Sim Bhullar</a>, who stands at . At , <a href="Margo%20Dydek">Margo Dydek</a> was the tallest player in the history of the WNBA.

The shortest player ever to play in the NBA is <a href="Muggsy%20Bogues">Muggsy Bogues</a> at . Other short players have thrived at the pro level. <a href="Spud%20Webb">Anthony "Spud" Webb</a> was just tall, but had a vertical leap, giving him significant height when jumping. While shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game, their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths.

The first <a href="non-white">non-white</a> player entered the league in 1947. According to <a href="racial%20equality">racial equality</a> activist <a href="Richard%20Lapchick">Richard Lapchick</a>, the NBA in 2011 was composed of 78 percent <a href="black%20people">black</a> players, 17 percent <a href="white%20people">white</a> players, four percent <a href="Latinos">Latinos</a> (of any race), and one percent <a href="Asian%20people">Asian</a>.

"And if you just had a couple of white guys in there, you might get them [the fans, not the guys] a little excited. But it is a black man's game, and it will be forever. I mean, the greatest athletes in the world are African-American," said Bird.

Variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball, using common basketball skills and equipment (primarily the ball and basket). Some variations are only superficial rules changes, while others are distinct games with varying degrees of basketball influences. Other variations include children's games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.

There are principal basketball sports with variations on basketball including <a href="Wheelchair%20basketball">Wheelchair basketball</a>, <a href="Water%20basketball">Water basketball</a>, <a href="Beach%20Basketball">Beach basketball</a>, <a href="Slamball">Slamball</a>, <a href="Streetball">Streetball</a> and <a href="Unicycle">Unicycle</a> basketball. An earlier version of basketball, played primarily by women and girls, was <a href="Six-on-six%20basketball">Six-on-six basketball</a>. <a href="Horseball">Horseball</a> is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net (approximately 1.5m×1.5m). The sport is like a combination of <a href="polo">polo</a>, <a href="rugby%20football">rugby</a>, and basketball. There is even a form played on donkeys known as <a href="Donkey%20basketball">Donkey basketball</a>, but that version has come under attack from animal rights groups.


There are also other basketball sports, such as:


Beach basketball has grown to a very popular, widespread competitive sport. 15 Annual World Championships have been organized.

Basketball has been adopted by various social groups, which have established their own environments and sometimes their own rules. Such socialized forms of basketball include the following.

Ball

A ball is a round object (usually <a href="sphere">spherical</a> but sometimes <a href="ovoid">ovoid</a>) with various uses. It is used in <a href="ball%20game">ball game</a>s, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, <a href="marbles">marbles</a> and <a href="juggling">juggling</a>. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in <a href="engineering">engineering</a> applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as <a href="ball%20bearings">ball bearings</a>. <a href="Black%20powder">Black-powder</a> weapons use stone and metal balls as <a href="projectile">projectile</a>s.

Although many types of balls are today made from <a href="rubber">rubber</a>, this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Columbus</a>. The Spanish were the first Europeans to see bouncing rubber balls (albeit solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballgame">Mesoamerican ballgame</a>. Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials.

As balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word "ball" is used to refer to, or to describe, anything spherical or near-spherical.

The first known use of the word "ball" in English in the sense of a globular body that is played with was in 1205 in "" in the phrase, "" The word came from the <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> "bal" (inflected as "ball-e, -es", in turn from <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "böllr" (pronounced ; compare Old Swedish "baller," and Swedish "boll") from <a href="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> "ballu-z," (whence probably Middle High German "bal, ball-es," Middle Dutch "bal"), a <a href="cognate">cognate</a> with <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> "ballo, pallo," Middle High German balle from Proto-Germanic "*ballon" (weak masculine), and Old High German "ballâ, pallâ," Middle High German "balle," Proto-Germanic "*ballôn" (weak feminine). No Old English representative of any of these is known. (The answering forms in Old English would have been "beallu, -a, -e"—compare "bealluc, ballock".) If "ball-" was native in Germanic, it may have been a cognate with the Latin "foll-is" in sense of a "thing blown up or inflated." In the later Middle English spelling "balle" the word coincided graphically with the French "balle" "ball" and "bale" which has hence been erroneously assumed to be its source. French "balle" (but not "boule") is assumed to be of Germanic origin, itself, however. In <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> the word πάλλα ("palla") for "ball" is attested besides the word "σφαίρα", "<a href="sphere">sphere</a>".

A ball, as the essential feature in many forms of gameplay requiring physical exertion, must date from the very earliest times. A rolling object appeals not only to a <a href="human%20baby">human baby</a> but to a <a href="kitten">kitten</a> and a <a href="puppy">puppy</a>. Some form of game with a ball is found portrayed on <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> monuments, and is played among aboriginal tribes at the present day. In <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, <a href="Nausicaa">Nausicaa</a> was playing at ball with her maidens when <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> first saw her in the land of the <a href="Phaeacia">Phaeacia</a>ns (Od. vi. 100). And Halios and Laodamas performed before <a href="Alcinous">Alcinous</a> and Odysseus with ball play, accompanied with dancing (Od. viii. 370).

Among the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a> games with balls (σφαῖραι) were regarded as a useful subsidiary to the more violent athletic exercises, as a means of keeping the body supple, and rendering it graceful, but were generally left to boys and girls. Of regular rules for the playing of ball games, little trace remains, if there were any such. The names in Greek for various forms, which have come down to us in such works as the Ὀνομαστικόν of <a href="Julius%20Pollux">Julius Pollux</a>, imply little or nothing of such; thus, ἀπόρραξις ("aporraxis") only means the putting of the ball on the ground with the open hand, οὐρανία ("ourania"), the flinging of the ball in the air to be caught by two or more players; φαινίνδα ("phaininda") would seem to be a game of catch played by two or more, where feinting is used as a test of quickness and skill. Pollux (i. x. 104) mentions a game called <a href="episkyros">episkyros</a> (ἐπίσκυρος), which has often been looked on as the origin of football. It seems to have been played by two sides, arranged in lines; how far there was any form of "goal" seems uncertain.

Among the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, ball games were looked upon as an adjunct to the bath, and were graduated to the age and health of the bathers, and usually a place (sphaeristerium) was set apart for them in the baths (thermae). There appear to have been three types or sizes of ball, the <a href="Pila%20%28ball%29">pila</a>, or small ball, used in catching games, the <a href="Paganica%20%28ball%20game%29">paganica</a>, a heavy ball stuffed with feathers, and the <a href="Follis%20%28ball%20game%29">follis</a>, a leather ball filled with air, the largest of the three. This was struck from player to player, who wore a kind of <a href="Gauntlet%20%28glove%29">gauntlet</a> on the arm. There was a game known as <a href="Trigon%20%28game%29">trigon</a>, played by three players standing in the form of a triangle, and played with the follis, and also one known as <a href="harpastum">harpastum</a>, which seems to imply a "scrimmage" among several players for the ball. These games are known to us through the Romans, though the names are Greek.

The various modern games played with a ball or balls and subject to rules are treated under their various names, such as <a href="polo">polo</a>, <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="football">football</a>, etc.

Several sports use a ball in the shape of a <a href="prolate%20spheroid">prolate spheroid</a>:

Binary relation

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a binary relation on a <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> "A" is a collection of <a href="ordered%20pair">ordered pair</a>s of elements of "A". In other words, it is a <a href="subset">subset</a> of the <a href="Cartesian%20product">Cartesian product</a> "A" = . More generally, a binary relation between two sets "A" and "B" is a subset of . The terms correspondence, dyadic relation and 2-place relation are synonyms for binary relation.

An example is the "<a href="divides">divides</a>" relation between the set of <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s P and the set of <a href="integer">integer</a>s Z, in which every prime "p" is associated with every integer "z" that is a <a href="divisibility">multiple</a> of "p" (but with no integer that is not a multiple of "p"). In this relation, for instance, the prime 2 is associated with numbers that include −4, 0, 6, 10, but not 1 or 9; and the prime 3 is associated with numbers that include 0, 6, and 9, but not 4 or 13.

Binary relations are used in many branches of mathematics to model concepts like "<a href="inequality%20%28mathematics%29">is greater than</a>", "<a href="Equality%20%28mathematics%29">is equal to</a>", and "divides" in <a href="arithmetic">arithmetic</a>, "<a href="Congruence%20%28geometry%29">is congruent to</a>" in <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, "is adjacent to" in <a href="graph%20theory">graph theory</a>, "is <a href="orthogonal">orthogonal</a> to" in <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a> and many more. The concept of <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> is defined as a special kind of binary relation. Binary relations are also heavily used in <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>.

A binary relation is the special case of an <a href="finitary%20relation">"n"-ary relation</a> "R" ⊆ "A" × … × "A", that is, a set of <a href="tuple">"n"-tuple</a>s where the "j"th component of each "n"-tuple is taken from the "j"th domain "A" of the relation. An example for a ternary relation on Z×Z×Z is " ... lies between ... and ...", containing e.g. the triples , , and .

In some systems of <a href="axiomatic%20set%20theory">axiomatic set theory</a>, relations are extended to <a href="class%20%28mathematics%29">classes</a>, which are generalizations of sets. This extension is needed for, among other things, modeling the concepts of "is an element of" or "is a subset of" in <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a>, without running into logical inconsistencies such as <a href="Russell%27s%20paradox">Russell's paradox</a>.

A binary <a href="finitary%20relation">relation</a> "R" between arbitrary <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a>s (or <a href="class%20%28set%20theory%29">class</a>es) "X" (the set of departure) and "Y" (the set of destination or <a href="codomain">codomain</a>) is specified by its <a href="graph%20of%20a%20relation">graph</a> "G", which is a <a href="subset">subset</a> of the <a href="Cartesian%20product">Cartesian product</a> "X" × "Y". The binary relation "R" itself is usually identified with its graph "G", but some authors define it as an ordered triple , which is otherwise referred to as a <a href="correspondence%20%28mathematics%29">correspondence</a>.

The statement is read ""x" is "R"-related to "y"", and is denoted by "xRy" or The latter notation corresponds to viewing "R" as the <a href="indicator%20function">characteristic function</a> of the subset "G" of i.e. equals to 1 (true), if and 0 (false) otherwise.

The order of the elements in each pair of "G" is important: if "a" ≠ "b", then "aRb" and "bRa" can be true or false, independently of each other. Resuming the above example, the prime 3 divides the integer 9, but 9 doesn't divide 3.

The <a href="domain%20of%20a%20function">domain</a> of "R" is the set of all "x" such that "xRy" for at least one "y". The <a href="image%20%28mathematics%29">range</a> of "R" is the set of all "y" such that "xRy" for at least one "x". The field of "R" is the union of its domain and its range.

According to the definition above, two relations with identical <a href="graph%20of%20a%20relation">graph</a>s but different domains or different codomains are considered different. For example, if formula_1, then formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 are three distinct relations, where formula_5 is the set of <a href="integer">integer</a>s, formula_6 is the set of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s and formula_7 is the set of <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s.

Especially in <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a>, binary relations are often defined as sets of ordered pairs, identifying binary relations with their graphs. The domain of a binary relation formula_8 is then defined as the set of all formula_9 such that there exists at least one formula_10 such that formula_11, the range of formula_8 is defined as the set of all formula_10 such that there exists at least one formula_9 such that formula_11, and the field of formula_8 is the union of its domain and its range.

A special case of this difference in points of view applies to the notion of <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a>. Many authors insist on distinguishing between a function's <a href="codomain">codomain</a> and its <a href="range%20%28mathematics%29">range</a>. Thus, a single "rule," like mapping every real number "x" to "x", can lead to distinct functions formula_17 and formula_18, depending on whether the images under that rule are understood to be reals or, more restrictively, non-negative reals. But others view functions as simply sets of ordered pairs with unique first components. This difference in perspectives does raise some nontrivial issues. As an example, the former camp considers <a href="surjection">surjectivity</a>—or being onto—as a property of functions, while the latter sees it as a relationship that functions may bear to sets.

Either approach is adequate for most uses, provided that one attends to the necessary changes in language, notation, and the definitions of concepts like <a href="restriction%20%28mathematics%29">restriction</a>s, <a href="composition%20of%20relations">composition</a>, <a href="inverse%20relation">inverse relation</a>, and so on. The choice between the two definitions usually matters only in very formal contexts, like <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a>.

Example: Suppose there are four objects {ball, car, doll, gun} and four persons {John, Mary, Ian, Venus}. Suppose that John owns the ball, Mary owns the doll, and Venus owns the car. Nobody owns the gun and Ian owns nothing. Then the binary relation "is owned by" is given as

Thus the first element of R is the set of objects, the second is the set of persons, and the last element is a set of ordered pairs of the form (object, owner).

The pair (ball, John), denoted by "R" means that the ball is owned by John.

Two different relations could have the same graph. For example: the relation
is different from the previous one as everyone is an owner. But the graphs of the two relations are the same.

Nevertheless, "R" is usually identified or even defined as G("R") and "an ordered pair ("x", "y") ∈ G("R")" is usually denoted as "("x", "y") ∈ "R"".

Some important types of binary relations "R" between two sets "X" and "Y" are listed below. To emphasize that "X" and "Y" can be different sets, some authors call such binary relations heterogeneous.

Uniqueness properties:

Totality properties (only definable if the sets of departure "X" resp. destination "Y" are specified; not to be confused with a <a href="total%20relation">total relation</a>):

Uniqueness and totality properties:

Less commonly encountered is the notion of difunctional (or regular) relation, defined as a relation "R" such that "R"="RR""R".

To understand this notion better, it helps to consider a relation as mapping every element "x"∈"X" to a set "xR" = { "y"∈"Y" | "xRy" }. This set is sometimes called the successor neighborhood of "x" in "R"; one can define the predecessor neighborhood analogously. Synonymous terms for these notions are afterset and respectively foreset.

A difunctional relation can then be equivalently characterized as a relation "R" such that wherever "x""R" and "x""R" have a non-empty intersection, then these two sets coincide; formally "x""R" ∩ "x""R" ≠ ∅ implies "x""R" = "x""R".

As examples, any function or any functional (right-unique) relation is difunctional; the converse doesn't hold. If one considers a relation "R" from set to itself ("X" = "Y"), then if "R" is both transitive and symmetric (i.e. a <a href="partial%20equivalence%20relation">partial equivalence relation</a>), then it is also difunctional. The converse of this latter statement also doesn't hold.

A characterization of difunctional relations, which also explains their name, is to consider two functions "f": "A" → "C" and "g": "B" → "C" and then define the following set which generalizes the <a href="kernel%20%28set%20theory%29">kernel</a> of a single function as joint kernel: ker("f", "g") = { ("a", "b") ∈ "A" × "B" | "f"("a") = "g"("b") }. Every difunctional relation "R" ⊆ "A" × "B" arises as the joint kernel of two functions "f": "A" → "C" and "g": "B" → "C" for some set "C".

In <a href="automata%20theory">automata theory</a>, the term rectangular relation has also been used to denote a difunctional relation. This terminology is justified by the fact that when represented as a boolean matrix, the columns and rows of a difunctional relation can be arranged in such a way as to present rectangular blocks of true on the (asymmetric) main diagonal. Other authors however use the term "rectangular" to denote any heterogeneous relation whatsoever.

If "X" = "Y" then we simply say that the binary relation is over "X", or that it is an endorelation over "X". In computer science, such a relation is also called a homogeneous (binary) relation. Some types of endorelations are widely studied in <a href="graph%20theory">graph theory</a>, where they are known as simple <a href="directed%20graph">directed graph</a>s permitting <a href="Loop%20%28graph%20theory%29">loops</a>.

The set of all binary relations Rel("X") on a set "X" is the set <a href="Power%20set">2</a> which is a <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29">Boolean algebra</a> augmented with the <a href="Involution%20%28mathematics%29">involution</a> of mapping of a relation to its <a href="%23Operations%20on%20binary%20relations">inverse</a> relation. For the theoretical explanation see <a href="Relation%20algebra">Relation algebra</a>.

Some important properties that a binary relation "R" over a set "X" may have are:


A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an <a href="equivalence%20relation">equivalence relation</a>. A relation that is symmetric, transitive, and serial is also reflexive. A relation that is only symmetric and transitive (without necessarily being reflexive) is called a <a href="partial%20equivalence%20relation">partial equivalence relation</a>.

A relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive is called a <a href="partial%20order">partial order</a>. A partial order that is total is called a <a href="total%20order">total order</a>, "simple order", linear order, or a chain. A linear order where every nonempty subset has a <a href="least%20element">least element</a> is called a <a href="well-order">well-order</a>.

If "R", "S" are binary relations over "X" and "Y", then each of the following is a binary relation over "X" and "Y":

If "R" is a binary relation over "X" and "Y", and "S" is a binary relation over "Y" and "Z", then the following is a binary relation over "X" and "Z": (see main article "<a href="composition%20of%20relations">composition of relations</a>")
A relation "R" on sets "X" and "Y" is said to be contained in a relation "S" on "X" and "Y" if "R" is a <a href="subset">subset</a> of "S", that is, if "x" "R" "y" always implies "x" "S" "y". In this case, if "R" and "S" disagree, "R" is also said to be smaller than "S". For example, > is contained in ≥.

If "R" is a binary relation over "X" and "Y", then the following is a binary relation over "Y" and "X":
If "R" is a binary relation over "X", then each of the following is a binary relation over "X":

If "R" is a binary relation over "X" and "Y", then the following too:

The complement of the inverse is the inverse of the complement.

If "X" = "Y", the complement has the following properties:

The complement of the inverse has these same properties.

The <a href="restriction%20%28mathematics%29">restriction</a> of a binary relation on a set "X" to a subset "S" is the set of all pairs ("x", "y") in the relation for which "x" and "y" are in "S".

If a relation is <a href="reflexive%20relation">reflexive</a>, <a href="irreflexive%20relation">irreflexive</a>, <a href="symmetric%20relation">symmetric</a>, <a href="antisymmetric%20relation">antisymmetric</a>, <a href="asymmetric%20relation">asymmetric</a>, <a href="transitive%20relation">transitive</a>, <a href="total%20relation">total</a>, <a href="Binary%20relation%23Relations%20over%20a%20set">trichotomous</a>, a <a href="partial%20order">partial order</a>, <a href="total%20order">total order</a>, <a href="strict%20weak%20order">strict weak order</a>, <a href="Strict%20weak%20order%23Total%20preorders">total preorder</a> (weak order), or an <a href="equivalence%20relation">equivalence relation</a>, its restrictions are too.

However, the transitive closure of a restriction is a subset of the restriction of the transitive closure, i.e., in general not equal.
For example, restricting the relation ""x" is parent of "y"" to females yields the relation ""x" is mother of the woman "y""; its transitive closure doesn't relate a woman with her paternal grandmother. On the other hand, the transitive closure of "is parent of" is "is ancestor of"; its restriction to females does relate a woman with her paternal grandmother.

Also, the various concepts of <a href="completeness%20%28order%20theory%29">completeness</a> (not to be confused with being "total") do not carry over to restrictions. For example, on the set of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s a property of the relation "≤" is that every <a href="empty%20set">non-empty</a> subset "S" of R with an <a href="upper%20bound">upper bound</a> in R has a <a href="supremum">least upper bound</a> (also called supremum) in R. However, for a set of rational numbers this supremum is not necessarily rational, so the same property does not hold on the restriction of the relation "≤" to the set of rational numbers.

The "left-restriction" ("right-restriction", respectively) of a binary relation between "X" and "Y" to a subset "S" of its domain (codomain) is the set of all pairs ("x", "y") in the relation for which "x" ("y") is an element of "S".

Various operations on binary endorelations can be treated as giving rise to an <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a>, known as <a href="relation%20algebra">relation algebra</a>. It should not be confused with <a href="relational%20algebra">relation"al" algebra</a> which deals in <a href="finitary%20relation">finitary relation</a>s (and in practice also <a href="Finite%20set">finite</a> and <a href="many-sorted">many-sorted</a>).

For heterogenous binary relations, a <a href="category%20of%20relations">category of relations</a> arises.

Despite their simplicity, binary relations are at the core of an abstract computation model known as an <a href="abstract%20rewriting%20system">abstract rewriting system</a>.

Certain mathematical "relations", such as "equal to", "member of", and "subset of", cannot be understood to be binary relations as defined above, because their domains and codomains cannot be taken to be sets in the usual systems of <a href="axiomatic%20set%20theory">axiomatic set theory</a>. For example, if we try to model the general concept of "equality" as a binary relation =, we must take the domain and codomain to be the "class of all sets", which is not a set in the usual set theory.

In most mathematical contexts, references to the relations of equality, membership and subset are harmless because they can be understood implicitly to be restricted to some set in the context. The usual work-around to this problem is to select a "large enough" set "A", that contains all the objects of interest, and work with the restriction = instead of =. Similarly, the "subset of" relation ⊆ needs to be restricted to have domain and codomain "P"("A") (the power set of a specific set "A"): the resulting set relation can be denoted ⊆. Also, the "member of" relation needs to be restricted to have domain "A" and codomain "P"("A") to obtain a binary relation ∈ that is a set. Bertrand Russell has shown that assuming ∈ to be defined on all sets leads to a <a href="Russell%27s%20paradox">contradiction</a> in naive set theory.

Another solution to this problem is to use a set theory with proper classes, such as <a href="Von%20Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del%20set%20theory">NBG</a> or <a href="Morse%E2%80%93Kelley%20set%20theory">Morse–Kelley set theory</a>, and allow the domain and codomain (and so the graph) to be <a href="proper%20class">proper class</a>es: in such a theory, equality, membership, and subset are binary relations without special comment. (A minor modification needs to be made to the concept of the ordered triple ("X", "Y", "G"), as normally a proper class cannot be a member of an ordered tuple; or of course one can identify the function with its graph in this context.) With this definition one can for instance define a function relation between every set and its power set.

The number of distinct binary relations on an "n"-element set is 2 :
Notes:

The binary relations can be grouped into pairs (relation, <a href="Binary%20relation%23Complement">complement</a>), except that for "n" = 0 the relation is its own complement. The non-symmetric ones can be grouped into <a href="4-tuple">quadruple</a>s (relation, complement, <a href="Binary%20relation%23Operations%20on%20binary%20relations">inverse</a>, inverse complement).

Braille

Braille (; ) is a tactile <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a> used by people who are <a href="Blindness">blind</a> or <a href="visually%20impaired">visually impaired</a>. It is traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to <a href="refreshable%20braille%20display">refreshable braille display</a>s. They can write braille with the original <a href="slate%20and%20stylus">slate and stylus</a> or type it on a <a href="braille%20writer">braille writer</a>, such as a portable <a href="braille%20notetaker">braille notetaker</a> or computer that prints with a <a href="braille%20embosser">braille embosser</a>.

Braille is named after its creator, <a href="Louis%20Braille">Louis Braille</a>, a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident. In 1824, at age 15, he developed a code for the <a href="French%20alphabet">French alphabet</a> as an improvement on <a href="night%20writing">night writing</a>. He published his system, which subsequently included <a href="musical%20notation">musical notation</a>, in 1829. The second revision, published in 1837, was the first <a href="Binary%20numeral%20system">binary</a> form of writing developed in the modern era.

Braille characters are rectangular blocks called "cells" containing tiny bumps called "raised dots". The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as <a href="Transcription%20%28linguistics%29">transcription</a> codes for printed writing, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language. Furthermore, in <a href="English%20Braille">English Braille</a> there are three levels of encoding: Grade 1 – a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; Grade 2 – an addition of abbreviations and contractions; and Grade 3 – various non-standardized personal <a href="shorthand">shorthand</a>s.

Braille cells are not the only thing to appear in braille text. There may be embossed illustrations and graphs, with the lines either solid or made of series of dots, arrows, bullets that are larger than braille dots, etc. A full Braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two columns, each having three dots. The dot positions are identified by numbers from one through six. 64 solutions are possible using one or more dots. A cell can be used to represent a letter, number, punctuation mark, or even a word.

In the face of <a href="screen%20reader">screen reader</a> software, braille usage has declined. However, because it teaches spelling and punctuation, braille education remains important for <a href="Learning%20to%20read">developing reading skills</a> among blind and visually impaired children, and <a href="braille%20literacy">braille literacy</a> correlates with higher employment rates.

Braille was based on a tactile military <a href="code">code</a> called <a href="night%20writing">night writing</a>, developed by <a href="Charles%20Barbier">Charles Barbier</a> in response to <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s demand for a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source. In Barbier's system, sets of 12 embossed dots encoded 36 different sounds. It proved to be too difficult for soldiers to recognize by touch and was rejected by the military. In 1821 Barbier visited the Royal Institute for the Blind in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, where he met Louis Braille. Braille identified two major defects of the code: first, by representing only sounds, the code was unable to render the orthography of the words; second, the human finger could not encompass the whole 12-dot symbol without moving, and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another. Braille's solution was to use 6-dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet.
At first, Braille was a one-to-one transliteration of French orthography, but soon various abbreviations, contractions, and even <a href="logogram">logogram</a>s were developed, creating a system much more like shorthand. The expanded English system, called <a href="Grade-2%20Braille">Grade-2 Braille</a>, was complete by 1905. For blind readers, Braille is an independent writing system, rather than a code of printed orthography.

Braille is derived from the Latin alphabet, albeit indirectly. In Braille's original system, the dot patterns were assigned to letters according to their position within the <a href="collating%20sequence">alphabetic order</a> of the French alphabet, with <a href="diacritic">accented</a> letters and "w" sorted at the end.

The first ten letters of the alphabet, "a–j," use the upper four dot positions: (black dots in the table below). These stand for the ten digits "1–9" and "0" in a system parallel to Hebrew <a href="gematria">gematria</a> and Greek <a href="isopsephy">isopsephy</a>. (Though the dots are assigned in no obvious order, the cells with the fewest dots are assigned to the first three letters (and lowest digits), "abc = 123" (), and to the three vowels in this part of the alphabet, "aei" (), whereas the even digits, "4, 6, 8, 0" (), are corners/right angles.)

The next ten letters, "k–t," are identical to "a–j," respectively, apart from the addition of a dot at position 3 (red dots in the table): :

The next ten letters (the next "<a href="wikt%3Adecade%23English">decade</a>") are the same again, but with dots also at positions both 3 and 6 (green dots). Here "w" was left out as not being a part of the official French alphabet at the time of Braille's life; the French braille order is "u v x y z ç é à è ù" ().

The next ten, ending in "w", are the same again, except that for this series position 6 (purple dot) is used without position 3. These are "â ê î ô û ë ï ü ö w" ().

The "a–j" series lowered by one dot space () are used for punctuation. Letters "a" and "c" , which only use dots in the top row, were lowered two places for the apostrophe and hyphen: . (These are the decade diacritics, at left in the table below, of the second and third decade.)

In addition, there are ten patterns that are based on the first two letters () shifted to the right; these were assigned to non-French letters ("ì ä ò" ), or serve non-letter functions: (superscript; in English the accent mark), (currency prefix), (capital, in English the decimal point), (number sign), (emphasis mark), (symbol prefix).

Originally there had been nine decades. The fifth through ninth used dashes as well as dots, but proved to be impractical and was soon abandoned. These could be replaced with what we now know as the number sign (), though that only caught on for the digits (old 5th decade → modern 1st decade). The dash occupying the top row of the original sixth decade was simply dropped, producing the modern fifth decade. (See <a href="1829%20braille">1829 braille</a>.)

Historically, there have been three principles in assigning the values of a <a href="Linear%20writing">linear script</a> (print) to Braille: Using Louis Braille's original French letter values; reassigning the braille letters according to the <a href="sort%20order">sort order</a> of the print alphabet being transcribed; and reassigning the letters to improve the efficiency of writing in braille.

Under international consensus, most braille alphabets follow the French sorting order for the 26 letters of the <a href="ISO%20basic%20Latin%20alphabet">basic Latin alphabet</a>, and there have been attempts at unifying the letters beyond these 26 (see <a href="international%20braille">international braille</a>), though differences remain, for example in <a href="German%20Braille">German Braille</a> and the contractions of <a href="English%20Braille">English Braille</a>. This unification avoids the chaos of each nation reordering the braille code to match the sorting order of its print alphabet, as happened in <a href="Algerian%20Braille">Algerian Braille</a>, where braille codes were numerically reassigned to match the order of the Arabic alphabet and bear little relation to the values used in other countries (compare modern <a href="Arabic%20Braille">Arabic Braille</a>, which uses the French sorting order), and as happened in an early American version of English Braille, where the letters "w, x, y, z" were reassigned to match English alphabetical order. A convention sometimes seen for letters beyond the basic 26 is to exploit the physical symmetry of braille patterns iconically, for example, by assigning a reversed "n" to "ñ" or an inverted "s" to "sh". (See <a href="Hungarian%20Braille">Hungarian Braille</a> and <a href="Bharati%20Braille">Bharati Braille</a>, which do this to some extent.)

A third principle was to assign braille codes according to frequency, with the simplest patterns (quickest ones to write) assigned to the most frequent letters of the alphabet. Such frequency-based alphabets were used in Germany and the United States in the 19th century (see <a href="American%20Braille">American Braille</a>), but none are attested in modern use. Finally, there are braille scripts which don't order the codes numerically at all, such as <a href="Japanese%20Braille">Japanese Braille</a> and <a href="Korean%20Braille">Korean Braille</a>, which are based on more abstract principles of syllable composition.

Academic texts are sometimes written in a script of eight dots per cell rather than six, enabling them to encode a greater number of symbols. (See <a href="Gardner%E2%80%93Salinas%20braille%20codes">Gardner–Salinas braille codes</a>.) <a href="Luxembourgish%20Braille">Luxembourgish Braille</a> has adopted eight-dot cells for general use; for example, it adds a dot below each letter to derive its capital variant.

Braille was the first writing system with <a href="Binary%20numeral%20system">binary</a> <a href="Character%20encoding">encoding</a>. The system as devised by Braille consists of two parts:

Within an individual cell, the dot positions are arranged in two columns of three positions. A raised dot can appear in any of the six positions, producing sixty-four (2) possible patterns, including one in which there are no raised dots. For reference purposes, a pattern is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised, the positions being universally numbered, from top to bottom, as 1 to 3 on the left and 4 to 6 on the right. For example, dot pattern 1-3-4 describe a cell with three dots raised, at the top and bottom in the left column and at the top of the right column: that is, the letter "m". The lines of horizontal Braille text are separated by a space, much like visible printed text, so that the dots of one line can be differentiated from the braille text above and below. Different assignments of braille codes (or <a href="code%20page">code page</a>s) are used to map the character sets of different printed scripts to the six-bit cells. Braille assignments have also been created for mathematical and musical notation. However, because the six-dot braille cell allows only 64 (2) patterns, including space, the characters of a braille script commonly have multiple values, depending on their context. That is, character mapping between print and braille is not one-to-one. For example, the character corresponds in print to both the letter "d" and the digit "4".

In addition to simple encoding, many braille alphabets use contractions to reduce the size of braille texts and to increase reading speed. (See <a href="English%20Braille%23Contractions">Contracted braille</a>)

Braille may be produced by hand using a <a href="slate%20and%20stylus">slate and stylus</a> in which each dot is created from the back of the page, writing in mirror image, or it may be produced on a <a href="braille%20typewriter">braille typewriter</a> or <a href="Perkins%20Brailler">Perkins Brailler</a>, or an electronic Brailler or eBrailler. Because braille letters cannot be effectively erased and written over if an error is made, an error is overwritten with all six dots (). "Interpoint" refers to braille printing that is offset, so that the paper can be embossed on both sides, with the dots on one side appearing between the divots that form the dots on the other (see the photo in the box at the top of this article for an example).
Using a computer or other electronic device, Braille may be produced with a <a href="braille%20embosser">braille embosser</a> (printer) or a <a href="refreshable%20braille%20display">refreshable braille display</a> (screen).

Braille has been extended to an 8-dot code, particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays. In 8-dot braille the additional dots are added at the bottom of the cell, giving a matrix 4 dots high by 2 dots wide. The additional dots are given the numbers 7 (for the lower-left dot) and 8 (for the lower-right dot). Eight-dot braille has the advantages that the case of an individual letter is directly coded in the cell containing the letter and that all the printable <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> characters can be represented in a single cell. All 256 (2) possible combinations of 8 dots are encoded by the <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> standard. Braille with six dots is frequently stored as <a href="Braille%20ASCII">Braille ASCII</a>.

The first 25 braille letters, up through the first half of the 3rd decade, transcribe "a–z" (skipping "w"). In English Braille, the rest of that decade is rounded out with the ligatures "and, for, of, the," and "with". Omitting dot 3 from these forms the 4th decade, the ligatures "ch, gh, sh, th, wh, ed, er, ou, ow" and the letter "w".

Various formatting marks affect the values of the letters that follow them. They have no direct equivalent in print. The most important in English Braille are:
That is, is read as capital 'A', and as the digit '1'.

Basic punctuation marks in English Braille include:

Punctuation varies from language to language. For example, <a href="French%20Braille">French Braille</a> uses for its question mark and swaps the quotation marks and parentheses (to and ); it uses the period () for the decimal point, as in print, and the decimal point () to mark capitalization.

Braille contractions are words and affixes that are shortened so that they take up fewer cells. In English Braille, for example, the word "afternoon" is written with just three letters, , much like <a href="stenoscript">stenoscript</a>. There are also several abbreviation marks that create what are effectively <a href="logogram">logogram</a>s. The most common of these is dot 5, which combines with the first letter of words. With the letter "m", the resulting word is "mother". There are also <a href="ligature%20%28typography%29">ligature</a>s ("contracted" letters), which are single letters in braille but correspond to more than one letter in print. The letter "and", for example, is used to write words with the sequence "a-n-d" in them, such as "hand".

Most <a href="braille%20embosser">braille embosser</a>s support between 34 and 40 cells per line, and 25 lines per page.

A manually operated Perkins braille typewriter supports a maximum of 42 cells per line (its margins are adjustable), and typical paper allows 25 lines per page.

A large interlining Stainsby has 36 cells per line and 18 lines per page.

An A4-sized Marburg braille frame, which allows interpoint braille (dots on both sides of the page, offset so they do not interfere with each other) has 30 cells per line and 27 lines per page.

A sighted child who is reading at a basic level should be able to understand common words and answer simple questions about the information presented. The child should also have enough fluency to get through the material in a timely manner. Over the course of a child's education, these foundations are built upon to teach higher levels of math, science, and comprehension skills. 

Children who are blind not only have the education disadvantage of not being able to see — they also miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools. Children who are blind or visually impaired can begin learning pre-braille skills from a very young age to become fluent braille readers as they get older.

In 1960, 50% of <a href="legally%20blind">legally blind</a>, school-age children were able to read braille in the U.S. According to the 2015 "Annual Report" from the <a href="American%20Printing%20House%20for%20the%20Blind">American Printing House for the Blind</a>, there were 61,739 legally blind students registered in the U.S. Of these, 8.6% (5,333) were registered as braille readers, 31% (19,109) as visual readers, 9.4% (5,795) as auditory readers, 17% (10,470) as pre-readers, and 34% (21,032) as non-readers.

There are numerous causes for the decline in braille usage, including school budget constraints, technology advancement, and different philosophical views over how <a href="blindness">blind</a> children should be educated.

A key turning point for braille literacy was the passage of the <a href="Rehabilitation%20Act%20of%201973">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a>, an <a href="act%20of%20Congress">act of Congress</a> that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into <a href="mainstreaming%20%28education%29">mainstream</a> public schools. Because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire braille-qualified teachers, braille literacy has declined since the law took effect. Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.

In 1998 there were 57,425 legally blind students registered in the United States, but only 10% (5,461) of them used braille as their primary reading medium.

Early Braille education is crucial to literacy for a blind or low-vision child. A study conducted in the state of Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well, if not better than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce.

Though Braille is thought to be the main way blind people read and write, in Britain (for example) out of the reported 2 million blind and low vision population, it is estimated that only around 15–20 thousand people use braille. Younger people are turning to electronic text on computers with <a href="screen%20reader">screen reader</a> software instead, a more portable communication method that they can use with their friends. A debate has started on how to make braille more attractive and for more teachers to be available to teach it.

Although it is possible to transcribe print by simply substituting the equivalent braille character for its printed equivalent, in English such a character-by-character transcription (known as "uncontracted braille") is only used by beginners.

Braille characters are much larger than their printed equivalents, and the standard 11" by 11.5" (28 cm × 30 cm) page has room for only 25 lines of 43 characters. To reduce space and increase reading speed, most braille alphabets and orthographies use ligatures, abbreviations, and contractions. Virtually all English Braille books are transcribed in this "contracted braille," which adds an additional layer of complexity to English orthography: The Library of Congress's "Instruction Manual for Braille Transcribing" runs to over 300 pages and braille transcribers must pass certification tests.

Fully contracted braille is known as "Grade 2 Braille". There is an intermediate form between Computer Braille—one-for-one identity with print—and Grade 2, which is called Grade 1 Braille. In Grade 1, the capital sign and Number sign are used, and most punctuation marks are shown using their Grade 2 values.

The system of <a href="contraction%20%28grammar%29">contraction</a>s in English Braille begins with a set of 23 words which are contracted to single characters. Thus the word "but" is contracted to the single letter "b," "can" to "c", "do" to "d", and so on. Even this simple rule creates issues requiring special cases; for example, "d" is, specifically, an abbreviation of the verb "do;" the noun "do" representing the note of the musical scale is a different word, and must be spelled out.

Portions of words may be contracted, and many rules govern this process. For example, the character with dots 2-3-5 (the letter "f" lowered in the Braille cell) stands for "ff" when used in the middle of a word. At the beginning of a word, this same character stands for the word "to"; the character is written in braille with no space following it. (This contraction was removed in the <a href="Unified%20English%20Braille%20Code">Unified English Braille Code</a>.) At the end of a word, the same character represents an exclamation point.

Some contractions are more similar than their print equivalents. For example, the contraction , meaning 'letter', differs from , meaning 'little', only in adding one dot to the second : "little", "letter". This causes greater confusion between the braille spellings of these words and can hinder the learning process of contracted braille.

The contraction rules take into account the linguistic structure of the word; thus, contractions are generally not to be used when their use would alter the usual braille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added. Some portions of the transcription rules are not fully codified and rely on the judgment of the transcriber. Thus, when the contraction rules permit the same word in more than one way, preference is given to "the contraction that more nearly approximates correct pronunciation."

"Grade 3 Braille" is a variety of non-standardized systems that include many additional shorthand-like contractions. They are not used for publication, but by individuals for their personal convenience.

When people produce braille, this is called braille transcription. When computer software produces braille, this is called braille
translation. Braille translation software exists to handle most of the common languages of the world, and many technical areas,
such as <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> (<a href="mathematical%20notation">mathematical notation</a>), for example <a href="WIMATS">WIMATS</a>, <a href="music">music</a> (<a href="musical%20notation">musical notation</a>), and tactile graphics.

Since Braille is one of the few writing systems where tactile perception is used, as opposed to visual perception, a braille reader must develop new skills. One skill important for Braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one's fingers along the words. There are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of braille, even though a study by B. F. Holland suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other.

Another study by Lowenfield & Abel shows that braille could be read "the fastest and best... by students who read using the index fingers of both hands." Another important reading skill emphasized in this study is to finish reading the end of a line with the right hand and to find the beginning of the next line with the left hand simultaneously. One final conclusion drawn by both Lowenfield and Abel is that children have difficulty using both hands independently where the right hand is the dominant hand. But this hand preference does not correlate to other activities.

When Braille was first adapted to languages other than French, many schemes were adopted, including mapping the native alphabet to the alphabetical order of French – e.g. in English W, which was not in the French alphabet at the time, is mapped to braille X, X to Y, Y to Z, and Z to the first French-accented letter – or completely rearranging the alphabet such that common letters are represented by the simplest braille patterns. Consequently, mutual intelligibility was greatly hindered by this state of affairs. In 1878, the International Congress on Work for the Blind, held in Paris, proposed an international braille standard, where braille codes for different languages and scripts would be based, not on the order of a particular alphabet, but on phonetic correspondence and transliteration to Latin.

This unified braille has been applied to the languages of India and Africa, Arabic, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Russian, and Armenian, as well as nearly all Latin-script languages. Greek, for example, "gamma" is written as Latin "g", despite the fact that it has the alphabetic position of "c"; Hebrew "bet", the second letter of the alphabet and <a href="cognate">cognate</a> with the Latin letter "b", is sometimes pronounced /b/ and sometimes /v/, and is written "b" or "v" accordingly; Russian "ts" is written as "c", which is the usual letter for /ts/ in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet; and Arabic "f" is written as "f", despite being historically "p", and occurring in that part of the Arabic alphabet (between historic "o" and "q").

Other systems for assigning values to braille patterns are also followed beside the simple mapping of the alphabetical order onto the original French order. Some braille alphabets start with <a href="unified%20braille">unified braille</a>, and then diverge significantly based on the phonology of the target languages, while others diverge even further.

In the various Chinese systems, traditional braille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels. In both <a href="Mainland%20Chinese%20Braille">Mandarin</a> and <a href="Cantonese%20braille">Cantonese Braille</a>, however, characters have different readings depending on whether they are placed in syllable-initial (onset) or syllable-final (rime) position. For instance, the cell for Latin "k", , represents Cantonese "k" ("g" in <a href="Yale%20romanization%20of%20Cantonese">Yale</a> and other modern romanizations) when initial, but "aak" when final, while Latin "j", , represents Cantonese initial "j" but final "oei".

Novel systems of braille mapping include Korean, which adopts separate syllable-initial and syllable-final forms for its consonants, explicitly grouping braille cells into syllabic groups in the same way as <a href="hangul">hangul</a>. Japanese, meanwhile, combines independent vowel dot patterns and modifier consonant dot patterns into a single braille cell – an <a href="abugida">abugida</a> representation of each Japanese <a href="Mora%20%28linguistics%29%23Japanese">mora</a>.

The current series of <a href="Banknotes%20of%20the%20Canadian%20dollar">Canadian banknotes</a> has a <a href="Canadian%20currency%20tactile%20feature">tactile feature</a> consisting of raised dots that indicate the denomination, allowing bills to be easily identified by blind or low vision people. It does not use standard braille; rather, the feature uses a system developed in consultation with blind and low vision Canadians after research indicated that braille was not sufficiently robust and that not all potential users read braille. <a href="Mexican%20peso%23Series%20D">Mexican bank notes</a>, <a href="Australian%20dollar">Australian bank notes</a>, <a href="Indian%20rupee">Indian rupee</a> notes, <a href="Israeli%20New%20Shekel">Israeli New Shekel</a> notes, <a href="Russian%20Ruble">Russian Ruble</a> and <a href="Swiss%20Franc">Swiss Franc</a> notes also have special raised symbols to make them identifiable by persons who are blind or low vision. 

In <a href="India">India</a> there are instances where the parliament acts have been published in braille, such as "The Right to Information Act".

In the United States, the <a href="Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201990">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</a> requires various building signage to be in braille.

In the United Kingdom, it is required that medicines have the name of the medicine in Braille on the labeling.

Australia also recently introduced the tactile feature onto their five dollar banknote

Braille was added to the <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.

Most <a href="braille%20embosser">braille embosser</a>s and <a href="refreshable%20braille%20display">refreshable braille display</a>s do not support Unicode, using instead 6-dot <a href="braille%20ASCII">braille ASCII</a>. Some embossers have proprietary control codes for 8-dot braille or for full graphics mode, where dots may be placed anywhere on the page without leaving any space between braille cells so that continuous lines can be drawn in diagrams, but these are rarely used and are not standard.

The Unicode standard encodes 8-dot braille glyphs according to their binary appearance, rather than following their assigned numeric order. Dot 1 corresponds to the <a href="least%20significant%20bit">least significant bit</a> of the low byte of the Unicode scalar value, and dot 8 to the high bit of that byte.

The Unicode block for braille is U+2800 ... U+28FF:

Every year on the 4th of January, World Braille Day is observed internationally to commemorate the birth of <a href="Louis%20Braille">Louis Braille</a> and to recognize his efforts. However, the event is not considered a public holiday.

Bastille Day

Bastille Day is the common name given in English-speaking countries/lands to the French <a href="National%20Day">National Day</a>, which is celebrated on the 14th of July each year. In France, it is formally called ' (; "The National Celebration") and commonly and legally ' (; "the fourteenth of July").

The French National Day commemorates the first anniversary of <a href="Storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">Storming of the Bastille</a> on 14 July 1789, a turning point of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, as well as the <a href="F%C3%AAte%20de%20la%20F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration">Fête de la Fédération</a> which celebrated the unity of the French people on 14 July 1790. Celebrations are held throughout France. The oldest and largest regular <a href="Bastille%20Day%20Military%20Parade">military parade</a> in Europe is held on the morning of 14 July, on the <a href="Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es">Champs-Élysées</a> in Paris in front of the <a href="President%20of%20France">President of the Republic</a>, along with other French officials and foreign guests.

On 19 May 1789, <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a> invited the <a href="Estates-General%20of%201789">Estates-General</a> (') to air their grievances. Of the three estates in France, the deputies of the Third Estate ('), representing the common people, decided to break away from the two others - the Catholic <a href="clergy">clergy</a> (', Roman Catholicism being the state religion at that time) and the <a href="nobility">nobility</a> ('). The Third Estate took the <a href="Tennis%20Court%20Oath">Tennis Court Oath</a> (', 20 June 1789), swearing not to separate until a constitution had been established. They were gradually joined by sympathising delegates of the other estates; <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a> started to recognise the validity of their concerns on 27 June. The assembly renamed itself the National Constituent Assembly (') on 9 July. 
<a href="Jacques%20Necker">Jacques Necker</a>, the finance minister, who was sympathetic to the Third Estate, was dismissed on 11 July. The people of Paris then stormed the <a href="Bastille">Bastille</a>, fearful that they and their representatives would be attacked by the royal army or by foreign regiments of mercenaries in the king's service, and seeking to gain ammunition and gunpowder for the general populace. The Bastille was a fortress-prison in Paris which had often held people jailed on the basis of "<a href="lettre%20de%20cachet">lettres de cachet</a>" (literally "signet letters"), arbitrary royal indictments that could not be appealed and did not indicate the reason for the imprisonment. The Bastille held a large cache of ammunition and gunpowder, and was also known for holding political prisoners whose writings had displeased the royal government, and was thus a symbol of the <a href="political%20absolutism">absolutism</a> of the monarchy. As it happened, at the time of the attack in July 1789 there were only seven inmates, none of great political significance.

The crowd was eventually reinforced by mutinous "<a href="Gardes%20Fran%C3%A7aises">Gardes Françaises</a>" ("French Guards"), whose usual role was to protect public buildings. They proved a fair match for the fort's defenders, and <a href="Bernard-Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Launay">Governor de Launay</a>, the commander of the Bastille, capitulated and opened the gates to avoid a mutual massacre. However, possibly because of a misunderstanding, fighting resumed. According to the official documents, about 200 attackers and just one defender died in the initial fighting, but in the aftermath, de Launay and seven other defenders were killed, as was <a href="Jacques%20de%20Flesselles">Jacques de Flesselles</a>, the "prévôt des marchands" ("provost of the merchants"), the elected head of the city's guilds, who under the feudal monarchy also had the competences of a present-day mayor.

Shortly after the storming of the Bastille, late in the evening of 4 August, after a very stormy session of the "Assemblée Constituante", <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> was abolished. On 26 August, the <a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a> ("Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen") was proclaimed ("Homme" with an uppercase h meaning “human”, while "homme" with a lowercase h means “man”).

The ' on 14 July 1790 was a celebration of the unity of the French nation during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. The aim of this celebration, one year after the <a href="Storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">Storming of the Bastille</a>, was to symbolise peace. The event took place on the <a href="Champ%20de%20Mars">Champ de Mars</a>, which was at the time far outside Paris. The place had been transformed on a voluntary basis by the population of Paris, in what was recalled as the ' ("Wheelbarrow Day").

A <a href="mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> was celebrated by <a href="Charles%20Maurice%20de%20Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord">Talleyrand</a>, <a href="bishop%20of%20Autun">bishop of Autun</a>. The popular <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20marquis%20de%20La%20Fayette">General Lafayette</a>, as captain of the National Guard of Paris and a confidant of the king, took his oath to the constitution, followed by King <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a>. After the end of the official celebration, the day ended in a huge four-day popular feast and people celebrated with fireworks, as well as fine wine and running nude through the streets in order to display their great freedom.

On 30 June 1878, a feast was officially arranged in Paris to honour the French Republic (the event was commemorated in a painting by <a href="Claude%20Monet">Claude Monet</a>). On 14 July 1879, there was another feast, with a semi-official aspect. The day's events included a reception in the Chamber of Deputies, organised and presided over by <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Gambetta">Léon Gambetta</a>, a military review at Longchamp, and a Republican Feast in the <a href="Bois%20de%20Boulogne">Pré Catelan</a>. All through France, "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" wrote, "people feasted much to honour the storming of the Bastille".

On 21 May 1880, <a href="Benjamin%20Raspail">Benjamin Raspail</a> proposed a law to have "the Republic choose the 14 July as a yearly national holiday". The Assembly voted in favour of the proposal on 21 May and 8 June. The Senate approved it on 27 and 29 June, favouring 14 July against 4 August (which would have commemorated the <a href="The%20Abolition%20of%20Feudalism">end of the feudal system</a> on 4 August 1789). The law was made official on 6 July 1880, and the Ministry of the Interior recommended to Prefects that the day should be "celebrated with all the brilliance that the local resources allow". Indeed, the celebrations of the new holiday in 1880 were particularly magnificent.

In the debate leading up to the adoption of the holiday, <a href="Henri%20Martin%20%28historian%29">Henri Martin</a>, chairman of the French Senate, addressed that chamber on 29 June 1880:

The <a href="Bastille%20Day%20Military%20Parade">Bastille Day Military Parade</a> is the French <a href="military%20parade">military parade</a> that has been held on the morning of 14 July each year in Paris since 1880. While previously held elsewhere within or near the capital city, since 1918 it has been held on the <a href="Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es">Champs-Élysées</a>, with the participation of the Allies as represented in the Versailles Peace Conference, and with the exception of the period of German occupation from 1940 to 1944 (when the ceremony took place in London under the command of General <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>). The parade passes down the Champs-Élysées from the <a href="Arc%20de%20Triomphe">Arc de Triomphe</a> to the <a href="Place%20de%20la%20Concorde">Place de la Concorde</a>, where the <a href="President%20of%20the%20French%20Republic">President of the French Republic</a>, his government and foreign ambassadors to France stand. This is a popular event in France, broadcast on French TV, and is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe. In some years, invited detachments of foreign troops take part in the parade and foreign statesmen attend as guests.

Smaller military parades are held in French garrison towns, including <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> and <a href="Belfort">Belfort</a>, with local troops.

Blowfish (cipher)

Blowfish is a <a href="Symmetric-key%20algorithm">symmetric-key</a> <a href="block%20cipher">block cipher</a>, designed in 1993 by <a href="Bruce%20Schneier">Bruce Schneier</a> and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> of it has been found to date. However, the <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (AES) now receives more attention.

Schneier designed Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the aging <a href="Data%20Encryption%20Standard">DES</a> and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by <a href="patent">patent</a>s or were commercial or government secrets. Schneier has stated that, "Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>, and can be freely used by anyone."

Notable features of the design include key-dependent <a href="S-box">S-box</a>es and a highly complex <a href="key%20schedule">key schedule</a>.

Blowfish has a 64-bit <a href="block%20size%20%28cryptography%29">block size</a> and a variable <a href="key%20length">key length</a> from 32 bits up to 448 bits. It is a 16-round <a href="Feistel%20cipher">Feistel cipher</a> and uses large key-dependent <a href="Substitution%20box">S-boxes</a>. In structure it resembles <a href="CAST-128">CAST-128</a>, which uses fixed S-boxes.

The diagram to the left shows Blowfish's encryption routine. Each line represents 32 bits. There are five subkey-arrays: one 18-entry P-array (denoted as K in the diagram, to avoid confusion with the Plaintext) and four 256-entry S-boxes (S0, S1, S2 and S3).

Every round "r" consists of 4 actions: First, XOR the left half (L) of the data with the "r" th P-array entry, second, use the XORed data as input for Blowfish's F-function, third, XOR the F-function's output with the right half (R) of the data, and last, swap L and R.

The F-function splits the 64-bit input into four eight-bit quarters, and uses the quarters as input to the S-boxes. The S-boxes accept 8-bit input and produce 32-bit output. The outputs are added <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modulo</a> 2 and XORed to produce the final 32-bit output (see image in the upper right corner).

After the 16th round, undo the last swap, and XOR L with K18 and R with K17 (output whitening).

Decryption is exactly the same as encryption, except that P1, P2, …, P18 are used in the reverse order. This is not so obvious because xor is commutative and associative. A common misconception is to use inverse order of encryption as decryption algorithm (i.e. first XORing P17 and P18 to the ciphertext block, then using the P-entries in reverse order).

Blowfish's <a href="key%20schedule">key schedule</a> starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values derived from the <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> digits of <a href="pi">pi</a>, which contain no obvious pattern (see <a href="nothing%20up%20my%20sleeve%20number">nothing up my sleeve number</a>). The secret key is then, byte by byte, cycling the key if necessary, XORed with all the P-entries in order. A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P and P. The same ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and the new ciphertext replaces P and P. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish encryption algorithm will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys - about 4KB of data is processed.

Because the P-array is 576 bits long, and the key bytes are XORed through all these 576 bits during the initialization, many implementations support key sizes up to 576 bits. While this is certainly possible, the 448 bits limit is here to ensure that every bit of every subkey depends on every bit of the key, as the last four values of the P-array don't affect every bit of the ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn't really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.

Blowfish is a fast <a href="block%20cipher">block cipher</a>, except when changing keys. Each new <a href="key%20%28cryptography%29">key</a> requires pre-processing equivalent to encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This prevents its use in certain applications, but is not a problem in others.

In one application Blowfish's slow key changing is actually a benefit: the <a href="password">password</a>-hashing method used in <a href="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a> uses an algorithm derived from Blowfish that makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against <a href="dictionary%20attack">dictionary attack</a>s. "See" <a href="key%20stretching">key stretching</a>.

Blowfish has a memory footprint of just over 4 kilobytes of <a href="Random%20Access%20Memory">RAM</a>. This constraint is not a problem even for older desktop and <a href="laptop%20computers">laptop computers</a>, though it does prevent use in the smallest <a href="embedded%20systems">embedded systems</a> such as early <a href="smartcard">smartcard</a>s.

Blowfish was one of the first secure block ciphers not subject to any patents and therefore freely available for anyone to use. This benefit has contributed to its popularity in cryptographic software.

<a href="bcrypt">bcrypt</a> is a <a href="Cryptographic_hash_function%23Password_verification">password hashing function</a> which, combined with a variable number of iterations (work "cost"), exploits the expensive key setup phase of Blowfish to increase the workload and duration of hash calculations, further reducing threats from brute force attacks.

bcrypt is also the name of a cross-platform file encryption utility implementing Blowfish developed in 2002.

Blowfish's use of a 64-bit block size (as opposed to e.g. AES's 128-bit block size) makes it vulnerable to <a href="Birthday_attack">birthday attacks</a>, particularly in contexts like <a href="HTTPS">HTTPS</a>. In 2016, the SWEET32 attack demonstrated how to leverage birthday attacks to perform plaintext recovery (i.e. decrypting ciphertext) against ciphers with a 64-bit block size such as Blowfish.

A reduced-round variant of Blowfish is known to be susceptible to <a href="known-plaintext%20attack">known-plaintext attack</a>s on reflectively weak keys. Blowfish implementations use 16 rounds of encryption, and are not susceptible to this attack. Blowfish users are encouraged by Bruce Schneier, Blowfish's creator, to use the more modern and computationally efficient alternative <a href="Twofish">Twofish</a>. He is quoted in 2007 as saying: The <a href="FAQ">FAQ</a> for <a href="GnuPG">GnuPG</a> (which features Blowfish as one of its algorithms) recommends that Blowfish should "not" be used to encrypt files that are larger than 4 Gb because of its small 64-bit block size.

<doc id="3942" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3942" title="Bijection">
Bijection

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a bijection, bijective function or one-to-one correspondence is a <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> between the elements of two <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">sets</a>, where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function "f": "X" → "Y" is a <a href="Injective%20function">one-to-one (injective)</a> and <a href="Surjective%20function">onto (surjective)</a> mapping of a set "X" to a set "Y".

A bijection from the set "X" to the set "Y" has an <a href="inverse%20function">inverse function</a> from "Y" to "X". If "X" and "Y" are <a href="finite%20set">finite set</a>s, then the existence of a bijection means they have the same number of elements. For <a href="infinite%20set">infinite set</a>s the picture is more complicated, leading to the concept of <a href="cardinal%20number">cardinal number</a>, a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a "<a href="permutation">permutation</a>".

Bijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of <a href="isomorphism">isomorphism</a>, <a href="homeomorphism">homeomorphism</a>, <a href="diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a>, <a href="permutation%20group">permutation group</a>, and <a href="projective%20map">projective map</a>.

For a pairing between "X" and "Y" (where "Y" need not be different from "X") to be a bijection, four properties must hold:

Satisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a bijection is a <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> with <a href="Domain%20of%20a%20function">domain</a> "X". It is more common to see properties (1) and (2) written as a single statement: Every element of "X" is paired with exactly one element of "Y". Functions which satisfy property (3) are said to be "<a href="onto">onto</a> "Y" " and are called <a href="Surjective%20function">surjections</a> (or surjective functions). Functions which satisfy property (4) are said to be "<a href="one-to-one%20function">one-to-one function</a>s" and are called <a href="Injective%20function">injections</a> (or injective functions). With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both "one-to-one" and "onto".

Bijections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow with tail (), as in "f" : "X" ⤖ "Y". This symbol is a combination of the two-headed rightwards arrow () sometimes used to denote surjections and the rightwards arrow with a barbed tail () sometimes used to denote injections.

Consider the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">batting line-up</a> of a <a href="baseball">baseball</a> or <a href="cricket">cricket</a> team (or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up). The set "X" will be the players on the team (of size nine in the case of baseball) and the set "Y" will be the positions in the batting order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The "pairing" is given by which player is in what position in this order. Property (1) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list. Property (2) is satisfied since no player bats in two (or more) positions in the order. Property (3) says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property (4) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.

In a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:
The instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.


A bijection "f" with domain "X" (indicated by "f": "X → Y" in <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29%23Notation">functional notation</a>) also defines a <a href="Relation%20%28mathematics%29">relation</a> starting in "Y" and going to "X" (by turning the arrows around). The process of "turning the arrows around" for an arbitrary function does not, "in general", yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this <a href="inverse%20relation">inverse relation</a> is a function with domain "Y". Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse "function" is a surjection and an injection, that is, the <a href="inverse%20function">inverse function</a> exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be <a href="Invertible%20function">invertible</a>. A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.

Stated in concise mathematical notation, a function "f": "X → Y" is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition

Continuing with the baseball batting line-up example, the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order. Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.

The <a href="composition%20%28mathematics%29">composition</a> formula_3 of two bijections "f": "X → Y" and "g": "Y → Z" is a bijection. The inverse of formula_3 is formula_5.
Conversely, if the composition formula_3 of two functions is bijective, we can only say that "f" is <a href="Injective%20function">injective</a> and "g" is <a href="surjective%20function">surjective</a>.

If "X" and "Y" are <a href="finite%20set">finite set</a>s, then there exists a bijection between the two sets "X" and "Y" <a href="iff">if and only if</a> "X" and "Y" have the same number of elements. Indeed, in <a href="axiomatic%20set%20theory">axiomatic set theory</a>, this is taken as the definition of "same number of elements" (<a href="equinumerosity">equinumerosity</a>), and generalising this definition to <a href="infinite%20set">infinite set</a>s leads to the concept of <a href="cardinal%20number">cardinal number</a>, a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.


Bijections are precisely the <a href="isomorphism">isomorphism</a>s in the <a href="category%20theory">category</a> <a href="Category%20of%20sets">Set</a> of <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">sets</a> and set functions. However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories. For example, in the category <a href="Category%20of%20groups">Grp</a> of <a href="Group%20%28mathematics%29">groups</a>, the morphisms must be <a href="homomorphism">homomorphism</a>s since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are "group isomorphisms" which are bijective homomorphisms.

The notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to <a href="partial%20functions">partial functions</a>, where they are called partial bijections, although partial bijections are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a <a href="total%20function">total function</a>, i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the <a href="symmetric%20inverse%20semigroup">symmetric inverse semigroup</a>.

Another way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from "A" to "B" is any relation 
"R" (which turns out to be a partial function) with the property that "R" is the <a href="Graph%20of%20a%20function">graph of</a> a bijection "f":"A′"→"B′", where "A′" is a <a href="subset">subset</a> of "A" and "B′" is a subset of "B".

When the partial bijection is on the same set, it is sometimes called a one-to-one partial <a href="transformation%20%28function%29">transformation</a>. An example is the <a href="M%C3%B6bius%20transformation">Möbius transformation</a> simply defined on the complex plane, rather than its completion to the extended complex plane.



This topic is a basic concept in set theory and can be found in any text which includes an introduction to set theory. Almost all texts that deal with an introduction to writing proofs will include a section on set theory, so the topic may be found in any of these:

<doc id="3943" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3943" title="Binary function">
Binary function

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a binary function (also called bivariate function, or function of two variables) is a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> that takes two inputs.

Precisely stated, a function formula_1 is binary if there exists <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a>s formula_2 such that
where formula_4 is the <a href="Cartesian%20product">Cartesian product</a> of formula_5 and formula_6

<a href="Naive%20set%20theory">Set-theoretically</a>, one may represent a binary function as a <a href="subset">subset</a> of the <a href="Cartesian%20product">Cartesian product</a> "X" × "Y" × "Z", where ("x","y","z") belongs to the subset <a href="if%20and%20only%20if">if and only if</a> "f"("x","y") = "z".
Conversely, a subset "R" defines a binary function if and only if <a href="universal%20quantification">for any</a> "x" in "X" and "y" in "Y", <a href="existential%20quantification">there exists</a> a <a href="uniqueness%20quantification">unique</a> "z" in "Z" such that ("x","y","z") belongs to "R".
We then define "f"("x","y") to be this "z".

Alternatively, a binary function may be interpreted as simply a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> from "X" × "Y" to "Z".
Even when thought of this way, however, one generally writes "f" ("x","y") instead of "f"(("x","y")).

Division of <a href="Integer">whole numbers</a> can be thought of as a function; if Z is the set of <a href="integer">integer</a>s, N is the set of <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s (except for zero), and Q is the set of <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s, then <a href="division%20%28mathematics%29">division</a> is a binary function from Z and N to Q.

Another example is that of inner products, or more generally functions of the form formula_7 where "x,y" are real-valued vectors of appropriate size and "M" is a matrix. If "M" is a <a href="positive%20definite%20matrix">positive definite matrix</a>, this yields an <a href="inner%20product">inner product</a>.

Functions whose domain is a subset of formula_8 are often also called functions of two variables even if their domain does not form a rectangle and thus the cartesian product of two sets.

In turn, one can also derive ordinary functions of one variable from a binary function.
Given any element "x" of "X", there is a function "f" , or "f" ("x",·), from "Y" to "Z", given by "f" ("y") := "f" ("x","y").
Similarly, given any element "y" of "Y", there is a function "f" , or "f" (·,"y"), from "X" to "Z", given by "f" ("x") := "f" ("x","y"). In computer science, this identification between a function from "X" × "Y" to "Z" and a function from "X" to "Z", where "Z" is the set of all functions from "Y" to "Z", is called "<a href="currying">currying</a>".

The various concepts relating to functions can also be generalised to binary functions.
For example, the division example above is "<a href="surjective%20function">surjective</a>" (or "onto") because every rational number may be expressed as a quotient of an integer and a natural number.
This example is "<a href="injective%20function">injective</a>" in each input separately, because the functions "f" and "f" are always injective.
However, it's not injective in both variables simultaneously, because (for example) "f" (2,4) = "f" (1,2).

One can also consider "partial" binary functions, which may be defined only for certain values of the inputs.
For example, the division example above may also be interpreted as a partial binary function from Z and N to Q, where N is the set of all natural numbers, including zero.
But this function is undefined when the second input is zero.

A <a href="binary%20operation">binary operation</a> is a binary function where the sets "X", "Y", and "Z" are all equal; binary operations are often used to define <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a>s.

In <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a>, a <a href="bilinear%20operator">bilinear transformation</a> is a binary function where the sets "X", "Y", and "Z" are all <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>s and the derived functions "f" and "f" are all <a href="linear%20transformation">linear transformation</a>s.
A bilinear transformation, like any binary function, can be interpreted as a function from "X" × "Y" to "Z", but this function in general won't be linear.
However, the bilinear transformation can also be interpreted as a single linear transformation from the <a href="tensor%20product">tensor product</a> formula_9 to "Z".

The concept of binary function generalises to "ternary" (or "3-ary") "function", "quaternary" (or "4-ary") "function", or more generally to "n-ary function" for any <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a> "n".
A "0-ary function" to "Z" is simply given by an element of "Z".
One can also define an "A-ary function" where "A" is any <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a>; there is one input for each element of "A".

In <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a>, "n"-ary functions generalise to "n"-ary morphisms in a <a href="multicategory">multicategory</a>.
The interpretation of an "n"-ary morphism as an ordinary morphisms whose domain is some sort of product of the domains of the original "n"-ary morphism will work in a <a href="monoidal%20category">monoidal category</a>.
The construction of the derived morphisms of one variable will work in a <a href="closed%20monoidal%20category">closed monoidal category</a>.
The category of sets is closed monoidal, but so is the category of vector spaces, giving the notion of bilinear transformation above.

Blue Velvet is a 1986 American <a href="neo-noir">neo-noir</a> <a href="mystery%20film">mystery film</a>, written and directed by <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>. Blending <a href="psychological%20horror">psychological horror</a> with <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, the film stars <a href="Kyle%20MacLachlan">Kyle MacLachlan</a>, <a href="Isabella%20Rossellini">Isabella Rossellini</a>, <a href="Dennis%20Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a> and <a href="Laura%20Dern">Laura Dern</a>. The title is taken from <a href="Bobby%20Vinton">Bobby Vinton</a>'s 1963 <a href="Blue%20Velvet%20%28song%29">song of the same name</a>.

The screenplay of "Blue Velvet" had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with many major studios declining it because of its strong sexual and violent content. After the commercial and critical failure of Lynch's "<a href="Dune%20%28film%29">Dune</a>" (1984), the director made attempts at developing a more "personal story," somewhat characteristic of the <a href="surrealism">surrealist</a> style displayed in his debut "<a href="Eraserhead">Eraserhead</a>" (1977). The independent studio <a href="De%20Laurentiis%20Entertainment%20Group">De Laurentiis Entertainment Group</a>, owned at the time by Italian film producer <a href="Dino%20De%20Laurentiis">Dino De Laurentiis</a>, agreed to finance and produce the film.

"Blue Velvet" initially received a divided critical response, with many stating that its objectionable content served little artistic purpose. It nevertheless earned Lynch his second <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for Best Director and came to achieve <a href="cult%20film">cult status</a>. As an example of a director casting against the norm, it was credited for re-launching Hopper's career and for providing Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond her previous work as a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman. 

In the years since, the film has generated significant academic attention with regard to its thematic symbolism, and is now widely regarded as one of Lynch's major works and one of the greatest films of the 1980s. Publications including "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>", "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" and "<a href="BBC">BBC Magazine</a>" have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time. In 2008, "Blue Velvet" was chosen by the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> as one of the <a href="AFI%27s%2010%20Top%2010">greatest American mystery films ever made</a>.

Jeffrey Beaumont returns to his logging home town of <a href="Lumberton%2C%20North%20Carolina">Lumberton, North Carolina</a>, from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams and becomes reacquainted with the detective's daughter, Sandy. She tells him details about the ear case and a suspicious woman, Dorothy Vallens, who may be connected to the case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.

Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, in which she sings "<a href="Blue%20Velvet%20%28song%29">Blue Velvet</a>," and leave early so Jeffrey can sneak into her apartment to snoop. He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, discovers him and threatens to kill him. Believing his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knife-point and begins to <a href="Fellatio">fellate</a> him before their encounter is interrupted by a knock at the door. Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there he witnesses the visitor, Frank Booth, inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities—which include inhaling an unidentified gas, <a href="Non-penetrative%20sex">dry humping</a>, and <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a>—upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent man whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. He continually refers to her as "Mommy" and to himself as both the "Daddy" and the "Baby," who "wants to fuck." Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors; to "Do it for van Gogh." When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.

Jeffrey relays his experience to Sandy, asking her why there are people like Frank. Sandy in turn tells him of a wonderful dream she had about robins that she interprets as a sign of hope for humanity. Jeffrey and Sandy find themselves attracted to each other, though Sandy has a boyfriend.

Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's apartment and she tells him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends the next few days spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.

Afterwards, Frank catches Dorothy and Jeffrey together and forces them both to accompany him to the apartment of Ben, his suave, effeminate partner in crime who is holding Dorothy's son. Ben <a href="lip-syncs">lip-syncs</a> a performance of <a href="Roy%20Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s "<a href="In%20Dreams%20%28Roy%20Orbison%20song%29">In Dreams</a>," sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a lumber yard and when he molests Dorothy, Jeffrey stands up to Frank by punching him. Frank's cronies drag Jeffrey out of the car and Frank kisses Jeffrey's face, intimidates him, and then savagely beats him to the overture of "In Dreams." Jeffrey wakes the next day at the same place and walks home, overcome with guilt and despair. He goes to the police station, where he notices that Sandy's father's partner is the Yellow Man—an officer named Lieutenant Detective Tom Gordon. Later, at Sandy's home, her father is amazed by Jeffrey's story, but warns Jeffrey to stop his amateur sleuthing lest he endanger himself and the investigation. Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance together and profess their love, only to be confronted by Sandy's boyfriend. A confrontation is averted when the group finds Dorothy—naked, battered, and distressed—on Jeffrey's front lawn. Barely conscious, Dorothy reveals her intimacy with Jeffrey, causing Sandy to become upset and to slap Jeffrey, although she later forgives him.

Jeffrey insists on returning to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot to the head and identifiable by his missing ear, as well as the Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.


The film's story originated from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind over a period of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only "a feeling" and the title "Blue Velvet," Lynch told "<a href="Cineaste%20%28magazine%29">Cineaste</a>" in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else ... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was <a href="Bobby%20Vinton">Bobby Vinton</a>'s classic rendition of the song "Blue Velvet" and "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while."

After completing "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28film%29">The Elephant Man</a>" (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth had read and enjoyed Lynch's "<a href="Ronnie%20Rocket">Ronnie Rocket</a>" script, but did not think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with <a href="Dino%20De%20Laurentiis">Dino De Laurentiis</a> that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that "Blue Velvet" was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. "After "Dune" I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.

The cast of "Blue Velvet" included several then-relatively unknown actors. Isabella Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her <a href="Lanc%C3%B4me">Lancôme</a> ads in the early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a> and Italian film director <a href="Roberto%20Rossellini">Roberto Rossellini</a>. After completion of the film, during test screenings, <a href="ICM%20Partners">ICM Partners</a>—the agency representing Rossellini—immediately dropped her as a client. Furthermore, the <a href="nuns">nuns</a> at the school in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> that Rossellini attended in her youth called to say they were praying for her. Dennis Hopper was the biggest "name" in the film, having starred in "<a href="Easy%20Rider">Easy Rider</a>" (1969), while Kyle MacLachlan had played the central role in Lynch's critical and commercial failure "<a href="Dune%20%28film%29">Dune</a>" (1984), a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> epic based on <a href="Dune%20%28novel%29">the novel of the same name</a>. MacLachlan later became a recurring collaborator with Lynch, who remarked: "Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with." Dennis Hopper—said to be Lynch's third choice—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, "I've got to play Frank! I am Frank!" as Hopper confirmed in the "Blue Velvet" "making-of" documentary "The Mysteries of Love," produced for the 2002 special edition. For the role of Dorothy Vallens, Lynch met Isabella Rossellini at a restaurant, and she accepted the role. Laura Dern, then just 19 years old, was cast after various successful actresses at the time turned it down, including <a href="Molly%20Ringwald">Molly Ringwald</a>.

The scene in which Dorothy appears naked outside was inspired by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> of "Blue Velvet" began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at <a href="EUE/Screen%20Gems">EUE/Screen Gems</a> studio in <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.

Lynch's original rough cut ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated to deliver a two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts at the request of the <a href="MPAA">MPAA</a>. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. Lynch announced in 2011, that footage from the <a href="deleted%20scene">deleted scene</a>s, long thought lost, had been discovered. It later appeared on the 2011 special edition <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> disc release of the film. The final cut produced by Lynch runs for just under two hours.

Despite "Blue Velvet"s initial appearance as a mystery, the film operates on a number of thematic levels. The film owes a large debt to 1950s <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, containing and exploring such conventions as the <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a> (Dorothy Vallens), a seemingly unstoppable <a href="villain">villain</a> (Frank Booth), and the questionable moral outlook of the hero (Jeffrey Beaumont), as well as its unusual use of shadowy, sometimes dark <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a>. "Blue Velvet" represents and establishes Lynch's famous "askew vision," and introduces several common elements of Lynch's work, some of which would later become his trademarks, including distorted characters, a polarized world, and debilitating damage to the skull or brain. Perhaps the most significant Lynchian trademark in the film is the depiction of unearthing a dark underbelly in a seemingly idealized small town; Jeffrey even proclaims in the film that he is "seeing something that was always hidden," alluding to the plot's central idea. Lynch's characterization of films, symbols, and motifs have become well-known, and his particular style, characterised largely in "Blue Velvet" for the first time, has been written about extensively using descriptions like "dreamlike," "ultraweird," "dark," and "oddball." Red curtains also show up in key scenes, specifically in Dorothy's apartment, which have since become a Lynch trademark. The film has been compared to <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>" (1960) because of its stark treatment of psychotic evil. The premise of both films is curiosity, leading to an investigation that draws the lead characters into a hidden, voyeuristic underworld of crime.

The film's thematic framework hearkens back to Poe, James, and early <a href="gothic%20fiction">gothic fiction</a>, as well as films such as "<a href="Shadow%20of%20a%20Doubt">Shadow of a Doubt</a>" (1943) and "<a href="The%20Night%20of%20the%20Hunter%20%28film%29">The Night of the Hunter</a>" (1955) and the entire notion of film noir. Lynch has called it a "film about things that are hidden—within a small city and within people." Like many other Lynch films, "Blue Velvet" is immersed in <a href="popular%20culture">pop culture</a> imagery, both from the 1950s and the 1960s, as well as the 1980s.

<a href="Feminist">Feminist</a> psychoanalytic film theorist <a href="Laura%20Mulvey">Laura Mulvey</a> argues that "Blue Velvet" establishes a metaphorical <a href="Oedipal">Oedipal</a> family—"the child," Jeffrey Beaumont, and his "parents," Frank Booth and Dorothy Vallens—through deliberate references to film noir and its underlying Oedipal theme. The resulting violence, she claims, can be read as symbolic of domestic violence within real families. For instance, Frank's violent acts can be seen to reflect the different types of abuse within families, and the control he has over Dorothy might represent the hold an abusive husband has over his wife. Michael Atkinson reads Jeffrey as an innocent youth who is both horrified by the violence inflicted by Frank, but also tempted by it as the means of possessing Dorothy for himself. Atkinson takes a <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freudian</a> approach to the film; considering it to be an expression of the traumatised innocence which characterises Lynch's work. He states, "Dorothy represents the sexual force of the mother [figure] because she is forbidden and because she becomes the object of the unhealthy, infantile impulses at work in Jeffrey's <a href="subconscious">subconscious</a>."

Symbolism is used heavily in "Blue Velvet." The most consistent symbolism in the film is an <a href="insect">insect</a> motif introduced at the end of the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan</a>esque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black <a href="ants">ants</a>. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like <a href="Oxygen%20mask%23Anesthesia%20oxygen%20masks">gas mask</a> that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an <a href="insect">insect</a> exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a <a href="Yellowjacket">type of wasp</a>. Finally, a <a href="American%20Robin">robin</a> eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.

The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers is also a key symbolic element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, the audience is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal until the end of the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.

The "Blue Velvet" soundtrack was supervised by <a href="Angelo%20Badalamenti">Angelo Badalamenti</a> (who makes a brief cameo appearance as the <a href="pianist">pianist</a> at the Slow Club where Dorothy performs). The soundtrack makes heavy usage of vintage pop songs, such as <a href="Bobby%20Vinton">Bobby Vinton</a>'s "Blue Velvet" and <a href="Roy%20Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s "<a href="In%20Dreams%20%28Roy%20Orbison%20song%29">In Dreams</a>," juxtaposed with an orchestral score inspired by <a href="Shostakovich">Shostakovich</a>. During filming, Lynch placed speakers on set and in streets and played Shostakovich to set the mood he wanted to convey. The score makes direct quotations from Shostakovich's <a href="Symphony%20No.%2015%20%28Shostakovich%29">15th Symphony</a>, which Lynch had been listening to regularly while writing the screenplay. Lynch had originally opted to use "<a href="Song%20to%20the%20Siren%20%28Tim%20Buckley%20song%29">Song To The Siren</a>" by <a href="This%20Mortal%20Coil">This Mortal Coil</a> during the scene in which Sandy and Jeffrey share a dance, however he could not obtain the rights for the song at the time. He would go onto use this song in "Lost Highway," eleven years later.

"<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" ranked "Blue Velvet's" soundtrack on its list of the "100 Greatest Film Soundtracks," at the 100th position. Critic John Alexander wrote, "the haunting soundtrack accompanies the title credits, then weaves through the narrative, accentuating the noir mood of the film." Lynch worked with music composer <a href="Angelo%20Badalamenti">Angelo Badalamenti</a> for the first time in this film and asked him to write a score that had to be "like Shostakovich, be very Russian, but make it the most beautiful thing but make it dark and a little bit scary." Badalamenti's success with "Blue Velvet" would lead him to contribute to all of Lynch's future full-length films until "<a href="Inland%20Empire%20%28film%29">Inland Empire</a>" and the cult television program "<a href="Twin%20Peaks">Twin Peaks</a>." Also included in the sound team was long time Lynch collaborator <a href="Alan%20Splet">Alan Splet</a>, a <a href="Sound%20editor%20%28filmmaking%29">sound editor</a> and designer who had won an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for his work on "<a href="The%20Black%20Stallion">The Black Stallion</a>" (1979), and been nominated for "<a href="Never%20Cry%20Wolf">Never Cry Wolf</a>" (1983).

"Blue Velvet" premiered in competition at the <a href="Montr%C3%A9al%20World%20Film%20Festival">Montréal World Film Festival</a> in August 1986, and at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto Festival of Festivals</a> on September 12, 1986, and a few days later in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It debuted commercially in both countries on September 19, 1986, in 98 theatres across the United States. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $789,409. It eventually expanded to another 15 theatres, and domestically grossed a total of $8,551,228. "Blue Velvet" was met with uproar during its audience reception, with lines formed around city blocks in New York City and Los Angeles. There were reports of mass walkouts and refund demands during its opening week. At a <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> screening, a man fainted and had to have his <a href="pacemaker">pacemaker</a> changed. Upon completion, he returned to the cinema to see the ending. At a Los Angeles cinema, two strangers became engaged in a heated disagreement, but decided to resolve the disagreement in order to return to the theatre.

It was also released internationally, in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, most of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, followed by subsequent video releases. The film performed well overseas, grossing $900,000 in Australia, and $450,139 in Hong Kong.

"Blue Velvet" was released to a polarized reception in the United States. The critics who did praise the film were often vociferous. "The New York Times" critic <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> directed much praise toward the performances of Hopper and Rossellini: "Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best understood in terms of sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems to be exactly what's called for." She called it "an instant cult classic." Maslin concluded by saying that "Blue Velvet" "is as fascinating as it is freakish. It confirms Mr. Lynch's stature as an innovator, a superb technician, and someone best not encountered in a dark alley."

<a href="Sheila%20Benson">Sheila Benson</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" called the film "the most brilliantly disturbing film ever to have its roots in small-town American life," describing it as "shocking, visionary, rapturously controlled." Film critic <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> included "Blue Velvet" on his list of the best films of 1986, at the fifth spot. <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a>, film critic for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>," named it the best film of the 1980s and referred to it as an "American masterpiece."

However, the film was not without its detractors. Paul Attanasio of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" said "the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents" and that Angelo Badalamenti "contributes an extraordinary score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score," but stated that Lynch "isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end." A general criticism from U.S. critics was "Blue Velvet"s often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence. They asserted that this detracted from the film's seriousness as a work of art, and some condemned the film as pornographic. One of its detractors, <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, praised Isabella Rossellini's performance as "convincing and courageous" but criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of <a href="misogyny">misogyny</a>: "degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film." While Ebert in later years came to consider Lynch a great filmmaker, his negative view of "Blue Velvet" remained unchanged after he revisited it in the 21st century.

The film is now considered a masterpiece and has a "Certified Fresh" score of 94% on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 62 reviews with an average rating of 8.7 out of 10. The critical consensus states: "If audiences walk away from this subversive, surreal shocker not fully understanding the story, they might also walk away with a deeper perception of the potential of film storytelling." The film also has a score of 75 out of 100 on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> based on 14 critics indicating "Generally favorable reviews". Looking back in his "Guardian/Observer" review, critic Philip French wrote, "The film is wearing well and has attained a classic status without becoming respectable or losing its sense of danger."

Mark Kermode walked out on the film and gave the film a poor review upon its release, but revised his view of the film over time. In 2016, he remarked, "as a film critic, it taught me that when a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, you have to be very careful about assessing it... I didn't walk out on Blue Velvet because it was a bad film. I walked out on it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it."

Lynch was nominated for a Best Director <a href="Academy%20Award">Oscar</a> for the film. Isabella Rossellini won an <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award">Independent Spirit Award</a> for the Best Female Lead in 1987. David Lynch and Dennis Hopper won a <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Film%20Critics%20Association">Los Angeles Film Critics Association</a> award in 1987 for "Blue Velvet" in categories Best Director (Lynch) and Best Supporting Actor (Hopper). In 1987, <a href="National%20Society%20of%20Film%20Critics">National Society of Film Critics</a> awarded Best Film, Best Director (David Lynch), Best Cinematography (Frederick Elmes), and Best Supporting Actor (Dennis Hopper) awards.

Although it initially gained a relatively small theatrical audience in North America and was met with controversy over its artistic merit, "Blue Velvet" soon became the center of a "national firestorm" in 1986, and over time achieved status as an American classic. In the late 1980s, and early 1990s, after its release on videotape, the film became a widely known <a href="cult%20film">cult film</a>, well known for its dark depiction of a suburban America. Followed by myriad VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases, the film became increasingly well-known among American audiences. It marked the entrance of David Lynch into the Hollywood mainstream and the comeback of Dennis Hopper after a significant hiatus from work. Hopper's performance and the character of Frank Booth itself has left an imprint on popular culture, with countless tributes, cultural references and parodies. The success of the film alone has helped propel Hollywood mainstream toward more graphic displays of previously censored themes, a similar case to "Psycho" (1960), to which "Blue Velvet" has been frequently compared. It has become one of the most significant, well-recognized films of its era, spawning countless imitations and parodies in media. The film's dark, stylish and erotic production design has served as a benchmark for a number of films, parodies and even Lynch's own later work, notably "<a href="Twin%20Peaks">Twin Peaks</a>" (1990–91), and "<a href="Mulholland%20Drive%20%28film%29">Mulholland Drive</a>" (2001). <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine cited it as one of the most "influential American films," as did <a href="Michael%20Atkinson%20%28writer%29">Michael Atkinson</a>, who dedicated a book to the film's themes and motifs.

"Blue Velvet" now frequently appears in various critical assessments of all-time great films, also ranked as one of the greatest films of the 1980s, one of the best examples of American surrealism and one of the finest examples of David Lynch's work. In a poll of two American critics ranking the "most outstanding films of the decade," "Blue Velvet" was placed third and fourth, behind "<a href="Raging%20Bull">Raging Bull</a>" (1980), "<a href="E.T.%20The%20Extra%20Terrestrial">E.T. The Extra Terrestrial</a>" (1982) and the German film "<a href="Wings%20of%20Desire">Wings of Desire</a>" (1987). An "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" book special released in 1999 ranked "Blue Velvet" at 37th of the greatest films of all time. The film was ranked by "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" in its list of the 100 Greatest Films. "<a href="Film%20Four">Film Four</a>'s" ranked it on their list of 100 Greatest Films. In a 2007 poll of the online film community held by "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>," "Blue Velvet" came in at the 95th greatest film of all time. "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>" ranked "Blue Velvet" as one of the all-time best films in both a critics list and a public poll, in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In December 2002, a UK film critics poll in "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" ranked the film fifth on their list of the 10 Best Films of the Last 25 Years. In a special "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" issue, 100 new film classics were chosen from 1983 to 2008: "Blue Velvet" was ranked at fourth.

In addition to "Blue Velvet's" various "all-time greatest films" rankings, the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> has awarded the film three honors in its lists: 96th on "<a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...%20100%20Thrills">100 Years...100 Thrills</a>" in 2001, selecting cinema's most thrilling moments and ranked Frank Booth 36th of the 50 greatest villains in "<a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Heroes%20and%20Villains">100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains</a>" in 2003. In June 2008, the AFI revealed its "<a href="AFI%27s%2010%20Top%2010">Ten top Ten</a>"—the best ten films in ten "classic" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. "Blue Velvet" was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the mystery genre. "<a href="Premiere%20%28magazine%29">Premiere</a>" magazine listed Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper, as the 54th on its list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, calling him one of "the most monstrously funny creations in cinema history." The film was ranked 84th on <a href="Bravo%20%28US%20TV%20channel%29">Bravo Television</a>'s four-hour program "100 Scariest Movie Moments" (2004). It is frequently sampled musically and an array of bands and solo artists have taken their names and inspiration from the film. In August 2012, "Sight & Sound" unveiled their latest list of the 250 greatest films of all time, with "Blue Velvet" ranking at 69th.

"Blue Velvet" was also nominated for the following AFI lists:

"Blue Velvet" was released on Blu-ray on November 8, 2011, in a special 25th anniversary edition featuring never-before-seen <a href="deleted%20scenes">deleted scenes</a>. The film had previously been released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> in 1999 and 2002 by MGM Home Entertainment. In early 2015, it was announced that a feature-length documentary film entitled "Blue Velvet Revisited," made up exclusively of behind the scenes footage, was in production for Autumn 2015 release. The film is based on extensive unreleased footage shot on set in 1985 by German filmmaker Peter Braatz, at David Lynch's invitation. <a href="Cult%20With%20No%20Name">Cult With No Name</a>, <a href="Tuxedomoon">Tuxedomoon</a> and <a href="John%20Foxx">John Foxx</a> were commissioned to provide the soundtrack for the film (which was released in October 2015), and a collection of previously unreleased photos is also to be published. The film was premiered at the <a href="London%20Film%20Festival">London Film Festival</a> in October 2016.

Inspired by the film, <a href="baroque%20pop">baroque pop</a> singer <a href="Lana%20Del%20Rey">Lana Del Rey</a> recorded a <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> of <a href="Bobby%20Vinton">Bobby Vinton</a>'s classic rendition of the song "Blue Velvet" in 2012. Used to endorse clothing line <a href="H%26amp%3BM">H&M</a>, a <a href="music%20video">music video</a> accompanied the track and aired as a <a href="television%20commercial">television commercial</a>. Filmed in <a href="Post-war">Post-war</a> <a href="Americana">Americana</a>, the video drew influence from Lynch and "Blue Velvet." In the video, Del Rey plays the role of Dorothy Vallens, performing a private concert similar to the scene where Ben (<a href="Dean%20Stockwell">Dean Stockwell</a>) <a href="Lip-synching%20in%20music">pantomimes</a> "<a href="In%20Dreams%20%28Roy%20Orbison%20song%29">In Dreams</a>" for Frank Booth.

When Lynch heard of the music video, he praised it, telling "<a href="Artinfo">Artinfo</a>": "Lana Del Rey, she's got some fantastic charisma and—this is a very interesting thing—it's like she's born out of another time. She's got something that's very appealing to people. And I didn't know she was influenced by me!"

Binary operation

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a binary operation on a <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> is a calculation that combines two elements of the set (called <a href="operands">operands</a>) to produce another element of the set. More formally, a binary operation is an <a href="Operation%20%28mathematics%29">operation</a> of <a href="arity">arity</a> two whose two <a href="Domain%20of%20a%20function">domains</a> and one <a href="codomain">codomain</a> are the same set. Examples include the familiar <a href="elementary%20arithmetic">elementary arithmetic</a> operations of <a href="addition">addition</a>, <a href="subtraction">subtraction</a>, <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a> and <a href="division%20%28mathematics%29">division</a>. Other examples are readily found in different areas of mathematics, such as <a href="vector%20addition">vector addition</a>, <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a> and <a href="Conjugation%20%28group%20theory%29">conjugation in groups</a>.

More precisely, a binary operation on a <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> "S" is a <a href="Map%20%28mathematics%29">map</a> which sends elements of the <a href="Cartesian%20product">Cartesian product</a> to "S":
Because the result of performing the operation on a pair of elements of "S" is again an element of "S", the operation is called a closed binary operation on "S" (or sometimes expressed as having the property of <a href="closure%20%28mathematics%29">closure</a>). If "f" is not a <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a>, but is instead a <a href="partial%20function">partial function</a>, it is called a partial binary operation. For instance, division of <a href="real%20numbers">real numbers</a> is a partial binary operation, because one can't <a href="Division%20by%20zero">divide by zero</a>: "a"/0 is not defined for any real "a". Note however that both in <a href="algebra">algebra</a> and <a href="model%20theory">model theory</a> the binary operations considered are defined on all of .

Sometimes, especially in <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, the term is used for any <a href="binary%20function">binary function</a>.

Binary operations are the keystone of algebraic structures studied in <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>: they are essential in the definitions of <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">groups</a>, <a href="monoid">monoid</a>s, <a href="semigroup">semigroup</a>s, <a href="ring%20%28algebra%29">ring</a>s, and more. Most generally, a "<a href="magma%20%28algebra%29">magma</a>" is a set together with some binary operation defined on it.

Typical examples of binary operations are the <a href="addition">addition</a> (+) and <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a> (×) of <a href="number">number</a>s and <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrices</a> as well as <a href="composition%20of%20functions">composition of functions</a> on a single set.
For instance,

Many binary operations of interest in both algebra and formal logic are <a href="commutative">commutative</a>, satisfying for all elements "a" and "b" in "S", or <a href="associative">associative</a>, satisfying for all "a", "b" and "c" in "S". Many also have <a href="identity%20element">identity element</a>s and <a href="inverse%20element">inverse element</a>s.

The first three examples above are commutative and all of the above examples are associative.

On the set of real numbers R, <a href="subtraction">subtraction</a>, that is, , is a binary operation which is not commutative since, in general, . It is also not associative, since, in general, ; for instance, but .

On the set of natural numbers N, the binary operation <a href="exponentiation">exponentiation</a>, , is not commutative since, <a href="Equation%20x%CA%B8%3Dy%CB%A3">in general</a>, and is also not associative since . For instance, with , and , , but . By changing the set N to the set of integers Z, this binary operation becomes a partial binary operation since it is now undefined when and "b" is any negative integer. For either set, this operation has a "right identity" (which is 1) since for all "a" in the set, which is not an "identity" (two sided identity) since in general.

<a href="division%20%28mathematics%29">Division</a> (/), a partial binary operation on the set of real or rational numbers, is not commutative or associative. <a href="Tetration">Tetration</a> (↑↑), as a binary operation on the natural numbers, is not commutative or associative and has no identity element.

Binary operations are often written using <a href="infix%20notation">infix notation</a> such as , , or (by <a href="wikt%3Ajuxtaposition">juxtaposition</a> with no symbol) "ab" rather than by functional notation of the form . Powers are usually also written without operator, but with the second argument as <a href="superscript">superscript</a>.

Binary operations sometimes use prefix or (probably more often) postfix notation, both of which dispense with parentheses. They are also called, respectively, <a href="Polish%20notation">Polish notation</a> and <a href="reverse%20Polish%20notation">reverse Polish notation</a>.

A binary operation, "ab", depends on the <a href="ordered%20pair">ordered pair</a> ("a, b") and so ("ab")"c" (where the parentheses here mean first operate on the ordered pair ("a", "b") and then operate on the result of that using the ordered pair (("ab"), "c")) depends in general on the ordered pair (("a", "b"), "c"). Thus, for the general, non-associative case, binary operations can be represented with <a href="binary%20tree">binary tree</a>s.

However:

A binary operation "f" on a set "S" may be viewed as a "ternary" <a href="Finitary%20relation">relation</a> on "S", that is, the set of triples ("a", "b", "f(a,b)") in "S" × "S" × "S" for all "a" and "b" in "S".

An <a href="external%20%28mathematics%29">external</a> binary operation is a binary function from "K" × "S" to "S". This differs from a binary operation in the strict sense in that "K" need not be "S"; its elements come from "outside".

An example of an <a href="external%20%28mathematics%29">external</a> binary operation is <a href="scalar%20multiplication">scalar multiplication</a> in <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a>. Here "K" is a <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> and "S" is a <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a> over that field.

An <a href="external%20%28mathematics%29">external</a> binary operation may alternatively be viewed as an <a href="group%20action">action</a>; "K" is acting on "S".

Note that the <a href="dot%20product">dot product</a> of two vectors is not a binary operation, external or otherwise, as it maps from "S"× "S" to "K", where "K" is a field and "S" is a vector space over "K".

<doc id="3950" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3950" title="Bagpipes">
Bagpipes

Bagpipes are a wind instrument using enclosed <a href="reed%20%28music%29">reeds</a> fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag. Though the Scottish <a href="Great%20Highland%20bagpipe">Great Highland bagpipe</a>s are the best known in the <a href="Anglophone%20world">Anglophone world</a>, bagpipes have been played for a millennium or more throughout large parts of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="northern%20Africa">northern Africa</a>, and <a href="western%20Asia">western Asia</a>, including <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, and around the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. The term "bagpipe" is equally correct in the singular or plural, though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as "the pipes", "a set of pipes" or "a stand of pipes".

A set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a <a href="chanter">chanter</a>, and usually at least one <a href="Drone%20%28music%29">drone</a>. Many bagpipes have more than one drone (and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various combinations, held in place in stocks—sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.

The most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe, or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling, but most blowpipes have a <a href="non-return%20valve">non-return valve</a> that eliminates this need.

An innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century, is the use of a <a href="bellows">bellows</a> to supply air. In these pipes, sometimes called "<a href="cauld%20wind%20pipes%20%28disambiguation%29">cauld wind pipes</a>", air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the Irish <a href="uilleann%20pipes">uilleann pipes</a>; the Scottish <a href="border%20pipes">border pipes</a> and <a href="Lowland%20pipes">Lowland pipes</a>; <a href="Northumbrian%20smallpipes">Northumbrian smallpipes</a>, <a href="pastoral%20pipes">pastoral pipes</a> and <a href="English%20Border%20pipes">English Border pipes</a> in Britain; and the <a href="musette%20de%20cour">musette de cour</a> in France.

The bag is an airtight <a href="reservoir">reservoir</a> that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including <a href="Gore-Tex">Gore-Tex</a> have become much more common. A drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of lung infection. An advantage of a synthetic bag is that they have a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag.

Bags cut from larger materials are usually <a href="saddle%20stitch">saddle-stitched</a> with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.

The chanter is the <a href="melody">melody</a> pipe, played with two hands. Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter; some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, the Balkans in Southern Europe, and Southwest Asia. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel (or "cylindrical") for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape. 

The chanter is usually open-ended, so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. Thus most bagpipes share a constant, <a href="legato">legato</a> sound where there are no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments (or "ornaments") are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take many years of study to master. A few bagpipes (such as the musette de cour, the uilleann pipes, the Northumbrian smallpipe, the piva and the left chanter of the "surdulina") have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg, so that when the player "closes" (covers all the holes) the chanter becomes silent.

A <a href="practice%20chanter">practice chanter</a> is a chanter without bag or drones, allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter.

The term "chanter" is derived from the Latin "cantare", or "to sing", much like the modern French word "<a href="wikt%3Achanteur%23French">chanteur</a>".

The note from the chanter is produced by a <a href="Reed%20%28instrument%29">reed</a> installed at its top. The reed may be a <a href="Single-reed%20instrument">single</a> (a reed with one vibrating tongue) or <a href="double%20reed">double reed</a> (of two pieces that vibrate against each other). Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally (although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions.

Most bagpipes have at least one <a href="drone%20%28music%29">drone</a>: a pipe which is generally not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play (usually the tonic note of the chanter). Exceptions are generally those pipes which have a double-chanter instead. A drone is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed, although drones with double reeds exist. The drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted.

Depending on the type of pipes, the drones may lie over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag, or may run parallel to the chanter. Some drones have a tuning screw, which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole, allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches. The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether. In most types of pipes, where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter. Additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.

The evidence for pre-Roman era bagpipes is still uncertain but several textual and visual clues have been suggested. The "Oxford History of Music" says that a sculpture of bagpipes has been found on a <a href="Hittites">Hittite</a> slab at <a href="Euyuk">Euyuk</a> in the Middle East, dated to 1000 BC. Several authors identify the <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> "askaulos" (ἀσκός "askos" – <a href="wine-skin">wine-skin</a>, αὐλός "<a href="aulos">aulos</a>" – reed pipe) with the bagpipe. In the 2nd century AD, <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> described the Roman emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a> as a player of the "tibia utricularis". <a href="Dio%20Chrysostom">Dio Chrysostom</a> wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe (<a href="Tibia%20%28instrument%29">tibia</a>, Roman reedpipes similar to Greek and Etruscan instruments) with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit.

In the early part of the second millennium, definite clear attestations of bagpipes began to appear with frequency in Western European art and iconography. The <a href="Cantigas%20de%20Santa%20Maria">Cantigas de Santa Maria</a>, written in <a href="Galician-Portuguese">Galician-Portuguese</a> and compiled in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a> in the mid-13th century, depicts several types of bagpipes. Several illustrations of bagpipes also appear in the "Chronique dite de Baudoin d’Avesnes", a 13th-century manuscript of northern French origin. Though evidence of bagpipes in the British Isles prior to the 14th century is contested, bagpipes are explicitly mentioned in "<a href="The%20Canterbury%20Tales">The Canterbury Tales</a>" (written around 1380):
Bagpipes were also frequent subjects for carvers of wooden choir stalls in the late 15th and early 16th century throughout Europe, sometimes with animal musicians.

Actual examples of bagpipes from before the 18th century are extremely rare; however, a substantial number of paintings, carvings, engravings, manuscript illuminations, and so on survive. They make it clear that bagpipes varied hugely throughout Europe, and even within individual regions. Many examples of early folk bagpipes in continental Europe can be found in the paintings of Brueghel, Teniers, Jordaens, and Durer.
The first clear reference to the use of the Scottish <a href="Highland%20bagpipes">Highland bagpipes</a> is from a French history, which mentions their use at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pinkie%20Cleugh">Battle of Pinkie Cleugh</a> in 1547. <a href="George%20Buchanan">George Buchanan</a> (1506–82) claimed that they had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the "ceòl mór" (great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments. The Highlands of the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the <a href="MacCrimmon%20%28piping%20family%29">MacCrimmonds</a>, MacArthurs, <a href="Clan%20Gregor">MacGregors</a> and the Mackays of <a href="Gairloch">Gairloch</a>.

Evidence of the bagpipe in Ireland occurs in 1581, when John Derrick's "<a href="The%20Image%20of%20Irelande">The Image of Irelande</a>" clearly depicts a bagpiper. Derrick's illustrations are considered to be reasonably faithful depictions of the attire and equipment of the English and Irish population of the 16th century. The "Battell" sequence from "<a href="My%20Ladye%20Nevells%20Booke">My Ladye Nevells Booke</a>" (1591) by <a href="William%20Byrd">William Byrd</a>, which probably alludes to the Irish wars of 1578, contains a piece entitled "The bagpipe: & the drone". In 1760, the first serious study of the Scottish Highland bagpipe and its music was attempted, in Joseph MacDonald's "Compleat Theory". Further south, a manuscript from the 1730s by a <a href="William%20Dixon%20manuscript">William Dixon</a> from <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> contains music that fits the <a href="border%20pipes">border pipes</a>, a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe whose chanter is similar to that of the modern <a href="Great%20Highland%20bagpipe">Great Highland bagpipe</a>. However the music in Dixon's manuscript varied greatly from modern Highland bagpipe tunes, consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes. Some of the tunes in the Dixon manuscript correspond to tunes found in early 19th century published and manuscript sources of <a href="Northumbrian%20smallpipe">Northumbrian smallpipe</a> tunes, notably the rare book of 50 tunes, many with variations, by John Peacock.

As Western classical music developed, both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology, bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour due to their limited range and function. This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.

Extensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York City, the <a href="International%20Bagpipe%20Museum">International Bagpipe Museum</a> in <a href="Gij%C3%B3n">Gijón</a>, Spain, the <a href="Pitt%20Rivers%20Museum">Pitt Rivers Museum</a> in Oxford, England and the <a href="Morpeth%20Chantry%20Bagpipe%20Museum">Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum</a> in Northumberland, and the <a href="Musical%20Instrument%20Museum%20%28Phoenix%29">Musical Instrument Museum</a> in Phoenix, Arizona.

During the expansion of the British Empire, spearheaded by British military forces that included <a href="Scottish%20regiment%23Highland%20Regiments">Highland regiments</a>, the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe became well-known worldwide. This surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.

In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Nations such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia the <a href="Great%20Highland%20bagpipe">Great Highland bagpipe</a> is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British Army have also taken the Highland bagpipe into use including Uganda, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Oman. Many police and fire services in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands.
In recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. In <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, the Great Highland bagpipe and concept of the <a href="pipe%20band">pipe band</a> were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation, the <a href="bagad">bagad</a>. The pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the <a href="Galician%20bagpipe">Galician gaita</a> as well. Additionally, bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film "<a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>" and the theatrical show "<a href="Riverdance">Riverdance</a>" have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known.

Bagpipes are sometimes played at formal events in Commonwealth universities, particularly in Canada. Because of the Scottish influences on the sport of <a href="curling">curling</a>, bagpipes are also the official instrument of the <a href="World%20Curling%20Federation">World Curling Federation</a> and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships.

Bagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive local traditional styles. Today, the world's biggest producer of the instrument is Pakistan, where the industry was worth $6.8 million in 2010. In the late 20th century, various models of <a href="electronic%20bagpipes">electronic bagpipes</a> were invented. The first custom-built <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> bagpipes were developed by the Asturian piper known as <a href="Hevia">Hevia</a> (José Ángel Hevia Velasco).

Dozens of types of bagpipes today are widely spread across Europe and the Middle East, as well as through much of the former <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the <a href="Great%20Highland%20bagpipe">Great Highland bagpipe</a>, overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out; for example, the <a href="Uilleann%20pipes">Irish piping tradition</a>, which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing a situation similar to that of the <a href="gaita%20asturiana">Asturian gaita</a>, the <a href="Galician%20gaita">Galician gaita</a>, the Portuguese <a href="gaita%20transmontana">gaita transmontana</a>, the Aragonese <a href="gaita%20de%20boto">gaita de boto</a>, <a href="Northumbrian%20smallpipe">Northumbrian smallpipe</a>s, the <a href="Breton%20people">Breton</a> <a href="biniou">biniou</a>, the <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a> <a href="gaida">gaida</a>, the <a href="Romanians">Romanian</a> <a href="cimpoi">cimpoi</a>, the Black Sea <a href="Tulum%20%28bagpipe%29">tulum</a>, the <a href="Scottish%20smallpipes">Scottish smallpipes</a> and <a href="pastoral%20pipes">pastoral pipes</a>, as well as other varieties.

Traditionally, one of the purposes of the bagpipe was to provide music for dancing. This has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music.

Since the 1960s, bagpipes have also made <a href="List%20of%20nontraditional%20bagpipe%20usage">appearances in other forms of music</a>, including rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and classical music, for example with <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>'s "<a href="Mull%20of%20Kintyre%20%28song%29">Mull of Kintyre</a>", <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a>'s "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Long%20Way%20to%20the%20Top%20%28If%20You%20Wanna%20Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%29">It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)</a>", and <a href="Peter%20Maxwell%20Davies">Peter Maxwell Davies</a>'s composition "<a href="An%20Orkney%20Wedding%2C%20with%20Sunrise">An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise</a>".

Biochemistry

Biochemistry, sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of <a href="chemical%20process">chemical process</a>es within and relating to living <a href="organism">organism</a>s. By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of <a href="chemical%20energy">chemical energy</a> through <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of <a href="life">life</a>. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all <a href="List%20of%20life%20sciences">areas of the life sciences</a> from <a href="botany">botany</a> to <a href="medicine">medicine</a> to <a href="genetics">genetics</a> are engaged in biochemical research. Today, the main focus of <a href="basic%20research">pure</a> biochemistry is on understanding how <a href="biomolecule">biological molecules</a> give rise to the processes that occur within living <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a>, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a>, <a href="organ%20%28anatomy%29">organs</a>, and whole organisms—that is, all of <a href="biology">biology</a>.

Biochemistry is closely related to <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>, the study of the <a href="molecule">molecular</a> mechanisms by which <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> information <a href="Genetic%20code">encoded</a> in <a href="DNA">DNA</a> is able to result in the processes of life. Depending on the exact definition of the terms used, molecular biology can be thought of as a branch of biochemistry, or biochemistry as a tool with which to investigate and study molecular biology.

Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of biological <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a>s, such as <a href="protein">protein</a>s, <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s, <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s and <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life. The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s and <a href="ion">ion</a>s. These can be <a href="inorganic">inorganic</a>, for example <a href="water">water</a> and <a href="metal">metal</a> ions, or <a href="Organic%20compound">organic</a>, for example the <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, which are used to <a href="Protein%20biosynthesis">synthesize proteins</a>. The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in <a href="medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="nutrition">nutrition</a>, and <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and <a href="Pharmaceutical%20drug">cures</a> of <a href="disease">disease</a>s. In nutrition, they study how to maintain health wellness and study the effects of <a href="nutritional%20deficiencies">nutritional deficiencies</a>. In agriculture, biochemists investigate <a href="soil">soil</a> and <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s, and try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation, crop storage and <a href="pest%20control">pest control</a>.

At its broadest definition, biochemistry can be seen as a study of the components, and composition of living things and how they come together to become life, and the history of biochemistry may therefore go back as far as the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a>. However, biochemistry as a specific <a href="scientific%20discipline">scientific discipline</a> has its beginning sometime in the <a href="19th%20century">19th century</a>, or a little earlier, depending on which aspect of biochemistry is being focused on. Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>, <a href="diastase">diastase</a> (today called <a href="amylase">amylase</a>), in 1833 by <a href="Anselme%20Payen">Anselme Payen</a>, while others considered <a href="Eduard%20Buchner">Eduard Buchner</a>'s first demonstration of a complex biochemical process <a href="Ethanol%20fermentation">alcoholic fermentation</a> in cell-free extracts in 1897 to be the birth of biochemistry. Some might also point as its beginning to the influential 1842 work by <a href="Justus%20von%20Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a>, "Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology", which presented a chemical theory of metabolism, or even earlier to the 18th century studies on <a href="fermentation">fermentation</a> and <a href="Cellular%20respiration">respiration</a> by <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>. Many other pioneers in the field who helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed founders of modern biochemistry, for example <a href="Hermann%20Emil%20Fischer">Emil Fischer</a> for his work on the chemistry of proteins, and <a href="Frederick%20Gowland%20Hopkins">F. Gowland Hopkins</a> on enzymes and the dynamic nature of biochemistry.

The term "biochemistry" itself is derived from a combination of <a href="biology">biology</a> and <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>. In 1877, <a href="Felix%20Hoppe-Seyler">Felix Hoppe-Seyler</a> used the term ("biochemie" in German) as a synonym for <a href="physiological%20chemistry">physiological chemistry</a> in the foreword to the first issue of "<a href="Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Physiologische%20Chemie">Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie</a>" (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) where he argued for the setting up of institutes dedicated to this field of study. The German <a href="chemist">chemist</a> <a href="Carl%20Neuberg">Carl Neuberg</a> however is often cited to have coined the word in 1903, while some credited it to <a href="Franz%20Hofmeister">Franz Hofmeister</a>.
It was once generally believed that life and its materials had some essential property or substance (often referred to as the "<a href="vital%20principle">vital principle</a>") distinct from any found in non-living matter, and it was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life. Then, in 1828, <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> published a paper on <a href="W%C3%B6hler%20synthesis">the synthesis</a> of <a href="urea">urea</a>, proving that <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic</a> compounds can be created artificially. Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as <a href="chromatography">chromatography</a>, <a href="X-ray%20diffraction">X-ray diffraction</a>, <a href="dual%20polarisation%20interferometry">dual polarisation interferometry</a>, <a href="protein%20nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance%20spectroscopy">NMR spectroscopy</a>, <a href="radioisotopic%20labeling">radioisotopic labeling</a>, <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscopy</a>, and <a href="molecular%20dynamics">molecular dynamics</a> simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s of the <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a>, such as <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a> and the <a href="Krebs%20cycle">Krebs cycle</a> (citric acid cycle).

Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the <a href="gene">gene</a> and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. This part of biochemistry is often called <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>. In the 1950s, <a href="James%20D.%20Watson">James D. Watson</a>, <a href="Francis%20Crick">Francis Crick</a>, <a href="Rosalind%20Franklin">Rosalind Franklin</a>, and <a href="Maurice%20Wilkins">Maurice Wilkins</a> were instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with genetic transfer of information. In 1958, <a href="George%20Beadle">George Beadle</a> and <a href="Edward%20Tatum">Edward Tatum</a> received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> for work in fungi showing that <a href="one%20gene-one%20enzyme%20hypothesis">one gene produces one enzyme</a>. In 1988, <a href="Colin%20Pitchfork">Colin Pitchfork</a> was the first person convicted of murder with <a href="DNA">DNA</a> evidence, which led to the growth of <a href="forensic%20science">forensic science</a>. More recently, <a href="Andrew%20Z.%20Fire">Andrew Z. Fire</a> and <a href="Craig%20C.%20Mello">Craig C. Mello</a> received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">2006 Nobel Prize</a> for discovering the role of <a href="RNA%20interference">RNA interference</a> (<a href="RNAi">RNAi</a>), in the silencing of <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>.

Around two dozen of the 92 naturally occurring <a href="chemical%20elements">chemical elements</a> are essential to various kinds of <a href="life">biological life</a>. Most <a href="Rare%20earth%20element">rare elements on Earth</a> are not needed by life (exceptions being <a href="selenium">selenium</a> and <a href="iodine">iodine</a>), while a few common ones (<a href="aluminum">aluminum</a> and <a href="titanium">titanium</a>) are not used. Most organisms share element needs, but there are a few differences between <a href="plants">plants</a> and <a href="animals">animals</a>. For example, ocean algae use <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, but land plants and animals seem to need none. All animals require <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, but some plants do not. Plants need <a href="boron">boron</a> and <a href="silicon">silicon</a>, but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).

Just six elements—<a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>—make up almost 99% of the mass of living cells, including those in the human body (see <a href="composition%20of%20the%20human%20body">composition of the human body</a> for a complete list). In addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body, humans require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more.

The four main classes of molecules in biochemistry (often called <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a>s) are <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s, <a href="protein">protein</a>s, and <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s. Many biological molecules are <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s: in this terminology, <a href="monomer">monomer</a>s are relatively small micromolecules that are linked together to create large <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a>s known as polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a <a href="Biopolymer">biological polymer</a>, they undergo a process called <a href="Dehydration%20reaction">dehydration synthesis</a>. Different macromolecules can assemble in larger complexes, often needed for <a href="biological%20activity">biological activity</a>.

The function of carbohydrates includes energy storage and providing structure. <a href="Sugar">Sugar</a>s are carbohydrates, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule; they are used to store energy and <a href="genetic%20information">genetic information</a>, as well as play important roles in cell to <a href="Cell%E2%80%93cell%20interaction">cell interactions</a> and <a href="Cell%20signaling">communications</a>.

The simplest type of carbohydrate is a <a href="monosaccharide">monosaccharide</a>, which among other properties contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1 (generalized formula CHO, where "n" is at least 3). <a href="Glucose">Glucose</a> (CHO) is one of the most important carbohydrates; others include <a href="fructose">fructose</a> (CHO), the sugar commonly associated with the <a href="sweet%20taste">sweet taste</a> of <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s, and <a href="deoxyribose">deoxyribose</a> (CHO).

A monosaccharide can switch from the <a href="Open-chain%20compound">acyclic (open-chain) form</a> to a <a href="cyclic%20compound">cyclic</a> form, through a <a href="nucleophilic%20addition">nucleophilic addition</a> reaction between the <a href="carbonyl%20group">carbonyl group</a> and one of the <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a>s of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> atom. The resulting molecule has an <a href="hemiacetal">hemiacetal</a> or <a href="hemiketal">hemiketal</a> group, depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a ketose. The reaction is easily reversed, yielding the original open-chain form.

In these cyclic forms, the ring usually has 5 or 6 atoms. These forms are called <a href="furanose">furanose</a>s and <a href="pyranose">pyranose</a>s, respectively — by analogy with <a href="furan">furan</a> and <a href="pyran">pyran</a>, the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the <a href="double%20bond">double bond</a>s of these two molecules). For example, the aldohexose <a href="glucose">glucose</a> may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called <a href="glucofuranose">glucofuranose</a>. The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called <a href="glucopyranose">glucopyranose</a>. Cyclic forms with a 7-atom ring (the same of <a href="oxepane">oxepane</a>), rarely encountered, are called <a href="heptoses">heptoses</a>.

When two monosaccharides undergo <a href="Dehydration%20reaction">dehydration synthesis</a> whereby a molecule of water is released, as two <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atoms and one <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> atom are lost from the two monosaccharides, the new molecule, consisting of two monosaccharides, is called a "<a href="disaccharide">disaccharide</a>" and is conjoined together by a <a href="Glycosidic%20bond">glycosidic</a> or <a href="ether%20bond">ether bond</a>. The reverse reaction can also occur, using a molecule of water to split up a disaccharide and break the glycosidic bond; this is termed "<a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>". The most well-known disaccharide is <a href="sucrose">sucrose</a>, ordinary <a href="sugar">sugar</a> (in scientific contexts, called "table sugar" or "<a href="cane%20sugar">cane sugar</a>" to differentiate it from other sugars). Sucrose consists of a <a href="glucose">glucose</a> molecule and a <a href="fructose">fructose</a> molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is <a href="lactose">lactose</a>, consisting of a glucose molecule and a <a href="galactose">galactose</a> molecule. As most humans age, the production of <a href="lactase">lactase</a>, the enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose back into glucose and <a href="galactose">galactose</a>, typically decreases. This results in <a href="lactase%20deficiency">lactase deficiency</a>, also called "lactose intolerance".

When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined, it is called an "<a href="oligosaccharide">oligosaccharide</a>" ("oligo-" meaning "few"). These molecules tend to be used as markers and <a href="Cell%20signaling">signals</a>, as well as having some other uses. Many monosaccharides joined together make a <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>. They can be joined together in one long linear chain, or they may be <a href="Branching%20%28polymer%20chemistry%29">branched</a>. Two of the most common polysaccharides are <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> and <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a>, both consisting of repeating glucose <a href="monomer">monomer</a>s. Examples are "cellulose" which is an important structural component of plant's <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>s, and "<a href="glycogen">glycogen</a>", used as a form of energy storage in animals.

<a href="Sugar">Sugar</a> can be characterized by having <a href="Reducing%20sugar">reducing</a> or non-reducing ends. A <a href="reducing%20end">reducing end</a> of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a> (<a href="aldose">aldose</a>) or keto form (<a href="ketose">ketose</a>). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the <a href="pyranose">pyranose</a> or <a href="furanose">furanose</a> form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full <a href="acetal">acetal</a>. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. <a href="Saccharose">Saccharose</a> does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).

<a href="Lipid">Lipid</a>s comprises a diverse range of <a href="molecules">molecules</a> and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or <a href="nonpolar">nonpolar</a> compounds of biological origin, including <a href="wax">wax</a>es, <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s, fatty-acid derived <a href="phospholipid">phospholipid</a>s, <a href="sphingolipid">sphingolipid</a>s, <a href="glycolipid">glycolipid</a>s, and <a href="terpenoid">terpenoid</a>s (e.g., <a href="retinoid">retinoid</a>s and <a href="steroid">steroid</a>s). Some lipids are linear <a href="aliphatic">aliphatic</a> molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are <a href="aromatic">aromatic</a>, while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.

Lipids are usually made from one molecule of <a href="glycerol">glycerol</a> combined with other molecules. In <a href="triglyceride">triglyceride</a>s, the main group of bulk lipids, there is one molecule of glycerol and three <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s. Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and may be <a href="Saturation%20%28chemistry%29">saturated</a> (no <a href="double%20bond">double bond</a>s in the carbon chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds in the carbon chain).

Most lipids have some <a href="polar%20molecule">polar</a> character in addition to being largely nonpolar. In general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> ("water-fearing"), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or <a href="hydrophilic">hydrophilic</a> ("water-loving") and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them <a href="amphiphilic">amphiphilic</a> molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, the polar group is a mere -OH (hydroxyl or alcohol). In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.

Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most <a href="oil">oil</a>s and <a href="milk%20product">milk product</a>s that we use for cooking and eating like <a href="butter">butter</a>, <a href="cheese">cheese</a>, <a href="ghee">ghee</a> etc., are composed of <a href="fat">fat</a>s. <a href="Vegetable%20oil">Vegetable oil</a>s are rich in various <a href="polyunsaturated%20fatty%20acid">polyunsaturated fatty acid</a>s (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol, which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids. Lipids, especially <a href="phospholipid">phospholipid</a>s, are also used in various <a href="pharmaceutical%20product">pharmaceutical product</a>s, either as co-solubilisers (e.g., in <a href="wikt%3Aparenteral">parenteral</a> infusions) or else as <a href="drug%20carrier">drug carrier</a> components (e.g., in a <a href="liposome">liposome</a> or <a href="transfersome">transfersome</a>).

<a href="Protein">Protein</a>s are very large molecules – macro-biopolymers – made from monomers called <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s. An amino acid consists of a carbon atom bound to four groups. One is an <a href="amino">amino</a> group, —NH, and one is a <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a> group, —COOH (although these exist as —NH and —COO under physiologic conditions). The third is a simple hydrogen atom. The fourth is commonly denoted "—R" and is different for each amino acid. There are 20 <a href="proteinogenic%20amino%20acid">standard amino acids</a>, each containing a <a href="carboxyl%20group">carboxyl group</a>, an <a href="amino%20group">amino group</a>, and a <a href="Substituent">side-chain</a> (known as an "R" group). The "R" group is what makes each amino acid different, and the properties of the side-chains greatly influence the overall <a href="Protein%20tertiary%20structure">three-dimensional conformation</a> of a protein. Some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a> functions as an important <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>. Amino acids can be joined via a <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>. In this <a href="Dehydration%20reaction">dehydration</a> synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a "<a href="dipeptide">dipeptide</a>", and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than thirty) are called "peptides" or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title "proteins". As an example, the important blood <a href="blood%20plasma">serum</a> protein <a href="human%20serum%20albumin">albumin</a> contains 585 amino acid residues.

Some proteins perform largely structural roles. For instance, movements of the proteins <a href="actin">actin</a> and <a href="myosin">myosin</a> ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules—they may be "extremely" selective in what they bind. <a href="Antibody">Antibodies</a> are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. In fact, the <a href="enzyme-linked%20immunosorbent%20assay">enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</a> (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s. Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called "<a href="substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrate</a>s"; they then <a href="Catalysis">catalyze</a> the reaction between them. By lowering the <a href="activation%20energy">activation energy</a>, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10 or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.

The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The <a href="primary%20structure">primary structure</a> of a protein simply consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, "alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-…". <a href="Secondary%20structure">Secondary structure</a> is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an <a href="alpha%20helix">α-helix</a> or into a sheet called a <a href="Beta%20sheet">β-sheet</a>; some α-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above. <a href="Tertiary%20structure">Tertiary structure</a> is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a> residue at position 6 with a <a href="valine">valine</a> residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in <a href="sickle-cell%20disease">sickle-cell disease</a>. Finally, <a href="quaternary%20structure">quaternary structure</a> is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.

Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the <a href="small%20intestine">small intestine</a>, and then absorbed. They can then be joined to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the <a href="pentose%20phosphate%20pathway">pentose phosphate pathway</a> can be used to make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize <a href="isoleucine">isoleucine</a>, <a href="leucine">leucine</a>, <a href="lysine">lysine</a>, <a href="methionine">methionine</a>, <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, <a href="threonine">threonine</a>, <a href="tryptophan">tryptophan</a>, and valine. These are the <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">essential amino acid</a>s, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize <a href="alanine">alanine</a>, <a href="asparagine">asparagine</a>, <a href="aspartate">aspartate</a>, <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a>, <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a>, <a href="glutamine">glutamine</a>, <a href="glycine">glycine</a>, <a href="proline">proline</a>, <a href="serine">serine</a>, and <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a>, the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize <a href="arginine">arginine</a> and <a href="histidine">histidine</a>, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.

If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an α-<a href="keto%20acid">keto acid</a>. Enzymes called <a href="transaminase">transaminase</a>s can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via <a href="transamination">transamination</a>. The amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein.

A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> (NH), existing as the <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> ion (NH) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different tactics have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals' needs. <a href="Unicellular">Unicellular</a> organisms, of course, simply release the ammonia into the environment. Likewise, <a href="osteichthyes">bony fish</a> can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert the ammonia into urea, via the <a href="urea%20cycle">urea cycle</a>.

In order to determine whether two proteins are related, or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison methods. Methods like <a href="sequence%20alignment">sequence alignment</a>s and <a href="structural%20alignment">structural alignment</a>s are powerful tools that help scientists identify <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologies</a> between related molecules. The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of <a href="Protein%20family">protein families</a>. By finding how similar two protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function.

<a href="Nucleic%20acids">Nucleic acids</a>, so called because of their prevalence in cellular <a href="cell%20nucleus">nuclei</a>, is the generic name of the family of biopolymers. They are complex, high-molecular-weight biochemical macromolecules that can convey <a href="genetic%20information">genetic information</a> in all living cells and viruses. The monomers are called <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s, and each consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a> (either a <a href="purine">purine</a> or a <a href="pyrimidine">pyrimidine</a>), a pentose sugar, and a <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> group.

The most common nucleic acids are <a href="deoxyribonucleic%20acid">deoxyribonucleic acid</a> (DNA) and <a href="ribonucleic%20acid">ribonucleic acid</a> (RNA). The <a href="phosphate%20group">phosphate group</a> and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid, while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information. The most common nitrogenous bases are <a href="adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="cytosine">cytosine</a>, <a href="guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="thymine">thymine</a>, and <a href="uracil">uracil</a>. The <a href="nitrogenous%20base">nitrogenous base</a>s of each strand of a nucleic acid will form <a href="hydrogen%20bonds">hydrogen bonds</a> with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid (similar to a zipper). Adenine binds with thymine and uracil; thymine binds only with adenine; and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another.

Aside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as <a href="second%20messenger">second messenger</a>s, as well as forming the base molecule for <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP), the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms. Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA.

Glucose is the major energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers (<a href="glycogen%20phosphorylase">glycogen phosphorylase</a> removes glucose residues from glycogen). Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.

Glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important ten-step <a href="Metabolic%20pathway">pathway</a> called <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a>, the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of <a href="pyruvate">pyruvate</a>. This also produces a net two molecules of <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>, the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting <a href="Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide">NAD</a> (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to <a href="lactic%20acid">lactate (lactic acid)</a> (e.g., in humans) or to <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> plus carbon dioxide (e.g., in <a href="yeast">yeast</a>). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.

In <a href="aerobic%20glycolysis">aerobic</a> cells with sufficient oxygen, as in most human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to <a href="acetyl-CoA">acetyl-CoA</a>, giving off one carbon atom as the waste product <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, generating another reducing equivalent as <a href="NADH">NADH</a>. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>, producing two more molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via <a href="FADH2">FADH</a> as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an <a href="electron%20transport%20system">electron transport system</a> transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane (<a href="inner%20mitochondrial%20membrane">inner mitochondrial membrane</a> in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD and <a href="quinone">quinone</a> are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional "28" molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle). It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.

In <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, vigorously contracting <a href="skeletal%20muscle">skeletal muscle</a>s (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to <a href="Fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">anaerobic metabolism</a>, converting glucose to lactate. The <a href="liver">liver</a> regenerates the glucose, using a process called <a href="gluconeogenesis">gluconeogenesis</a>. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or <a href="starch">starch</a> in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the <a href="Cori%20cycle">Cori cycle</a>.

Researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a> and <a href="biophysics">biophysics</a>. There has never been a hard-line among these disciplines in terms of content and technique. Today, the terms "molecular biology" and "biochemistry" are nearly interchangeable. The following figure is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields:



a. Fructose is not the only sugar found in fruits. Glucose and sucrose are also found in varying quantities in various fruits, and indeed sometimes exceed the fructose present. For example, 32% of the edible portion of date is glucose, compared with 23.70% fructose and 8.20% sucrose. However, peaches contain more sucrose (6.66%) than they do fructose (0.93%) or glucose (1.47%).

Badminton

Badminton is a racquet sport played using <a href="racket%20%28sports%20equipment%29">racquets</a> to hit a <a href="shuttlecock">shuttlecock</a> across a <a href="net%20%28device%29">net</a>. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.

Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.

The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a>, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.

The game developed in <a href="British%20India">British India</a> from the earlier game of <a href="battledore%20and%20shuttlecock">battledore and shuttlecock</a>. European play came to be dominated by <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> but the game has became very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by <a href="China">China</a>. Since 1992, badminton has been a <a href="Summer%20Olympics">Summer</a> <a href="Olympic%20sports">Olympic sport</a> with <a href="Badminton%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">five events</a>: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require <a href="Aerobic%20conditioning">aerobic stamina</a>, <a href="agility">agility</a>, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good <a href="motor%20coordination">motor coordination</a> and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.

Games employing <a href="shuttlecock">shuttlecock</a>s have been played for centuries across <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the <a href="British%20people">British</a> as a variant of the earlier game of <a href="battledore%20and%20shuttlecock">battledore and shuttlecock</a>. ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".) Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the <a href="Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Duke of Beaufort</a>'s <a href="Badminton%20House">Badminton House</a> in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named <a href="Isaac%20Spratt">Isaac Spratt</a> published a booklet entitled "Badminton Battledore – A New Game", but no copy is known to have survived. An 1863 article in "The Cornhill Magazine" describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground".

The game may have originally developed among expatriate officers in <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, where it was very popular by the 1870s. <a href="Ball%20badminton">Ball badminton</a>, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in <a href="Thanjavur%20Maratha%20kingdom">Thanjavur</a> as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.

Early on, the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of <a href="Pune">Pune</a>, where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873. By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a>. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best. The shuttlecocks were coated with <a href="India%20rubber">India rubber</a> and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with <a href="lead">lead</a>. Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.

The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the <a href="Bath%2C%20England">Bath</a> Badminton Club drew up revised regulations. In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules. The <a href="Badminton%20England">Badminton Association</a> of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called "Dunbar" in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on 13 September. The BAE started the first badminton competition, the <a href="All%20England%20Open%20Badminton%20Championships">All England Open Badminton Championships</a> for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899. Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an <a href="England">England</a>–<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> championship match appeared in 1904.

England, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in 1934, now known as the <a href="Badminton%20World%20Federation">Badminton World Federation</a>. <a href="India">India</a> joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs international badminton. Although initiated in England, competitive men's badminton has traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations have become dominant in international competition. <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, and <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> are the nations which have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men's and women's competition recently.

The game has also become a popular backyard sport in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

The following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, "Laws of Badminton".

The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only. The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.

The full width of the court is 6.1 metres (20 ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18 metres (17 ft). The full length of the court is 13.4 metres (44 ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 metres (2 ft 6 inch) from the back boundary.

The net is 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 inch) high at the edges and 1.524 metres (5 ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.

The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.

When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault.

At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite "service courts" (see <a href="%23Playing%20court%20dimensions">court dimensions</a>). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar to <a href="tennis">tennis</a>, except that a badminton serve must be hit below waist height and with the racquet shaft pointing downwards, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts unlike tennis.

When the serving side loses a rally, the serve immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a "second serve").

In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.

In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is that, each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did "not" serve last time.

Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.

If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24–22), except when there is a tie at 29-all, in which the game goes to a golden point. Whoever scores this point will win.

At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy first, and their opponents making the leftover the remaining choice.

In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.

The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.

If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on court (having been hit there by players playing in adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.

If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, the receiver shall be judged to have been ready.

Badminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks.

Badminton <a href="Racket%20%28sports%20equipment%29">racquets</a> are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between not including grip or strings. They are composed of many different materials ranging from <a href="carbon%20fiber%20composite">carbon fibre composite</a> (<a href="graphite%20reinforced%20plastic">graphite reinforced plastic</a>) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials. <a href="carbon%20fiber">Carbon fibre</a> has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminum. Earlier still, racquets were made of wood. Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as <a href="fullerene">fullerene</a> and <a href="carbon%20nanotubes">carbon nanotubes</a> are added to racquets giving them greater durability.

There is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape. Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an <a href="wikt%3Aisometric">isometric</a> head shape is increasingly common in new racquets.

Badminton strings are thin, high performing strings with thicknesses ranging from about 0.62 to 0.73 mm. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 80 to 160 <a href="newton%20%28unit%29">N</a> (18 to 36 <a href="pound-force">lbf</a>). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 80 and 110 N (18 and 25 lbf). Professionals string between about 110 and 160 N (25 and 36 lbf). Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker than specified when slack. Ashaway Micropower is actually 0.7mm but Yonex BG-66 is about 0.72mm.

It is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power. The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. This is in fact incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player: the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment.

The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.

Players may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are <a href="polyurethane">PU</a> synthetic grips or towelling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his/her grip more frequently.

There are two main types of grip: "replacement" grips and "overgrips". Replacement grips are thicker, and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1 mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Towelling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.

A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to "shuttle"; also called a "birdie") is a high-drag <a href="projectile">projectile</a>, with an open <a href="Cone%20%28geometry%29">conical shape</a>: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping <a href="feathers">feathers</a> embedded into a rounded cork base. The <a href="Cork%20%28material%29">cork</a> is covered with thin <a href="leather">leather</a> or synthetic material. <a href="Nylon%20%28material%29">Synthetic</a> shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base, and a plastic skirt.

Badminton rules also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed:

Badminton <a href="Athletic%20shoe">shoes</a> are lightweight with soles of <a href="rubber">rubber</a> or similar high-grip, non-marking materials.

Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little <a href="support%20%28structure%29">lateral support</a>. High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.

Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either "forehand" or "backhand". A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.

In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a "round-the-head" forehand overhead (a forehand "on the backhand side") rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The "backhand clear" is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court. For the same reason, "backhand smashes" tend to be weak.

The choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above net height, and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. In the forecourt, a high shuttlecock will be met with a "net kill", hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation. In the midcourt, a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful "smash", also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic "jump smashes", where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. In the rearcourt, players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This "overhead" hitting allows them to play smashes, "clears" (hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents' court), and "drop shots" (hitting the shuttlecock softly so that it falls sharply downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.

When the shuttlecock is well below net height, players have no choice but to hit upwards. "Lifts", where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents' court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, his only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt this is called a "netshot"; in the midcourt or rearcourt, it is often called a "push" or "block".

When the shuttlecock is near to net height, players can hit "drives", which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rearcourt. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.

Balls may be spun to alter their bounce (for example, topspin and backspin in tennis) or trajectory, and players may slice the ball (strike it with an angled racquet face) to produce such spin; but, since the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, this does not apply to badminton.

Slicing the shuttlecock so that it spins, however, does have applications, and some are particular to badminton. (See <a href="%23Basic%20Strokes">Basic strokes</a> for an explanation of technical terms.)

Due to the way that its feathers overlap, a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry. The spin is in a counter-clockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock. This natural spin affects certain strokes: a tumbling netshot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left, rather than from left to right.

Badminton <a href="biomechanics">biomechanics</a> have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm. Recent guides to the sport thus emphasize forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.

The feathers impart substantial drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance. The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable: regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork-first, and remain in the cork-first orientation.

One consequence of the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires considerable power to hit it the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racquet sports. The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted ("lobbed") shuttlecock: the <a href="parabola">parabola</a> of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises. With very high serves, the shuttlecock may even fall vertically.

When defending against a smash, players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes, but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides, because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.

The service is restricted by <a href="%23Laws%20of%20the%20game">the Laws</a> and presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in tennis, the server's racquet must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net. The server can choose a "low serve" into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat "drive serve". Lifted serves may be either "high serves", where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or "flick serves", where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.

Once players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either he is tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or he is forced to delay his movement until he actually sees the shuttle's direction. "Deception" in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, he will often lose the point immediately because he cannot change his direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay his movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.

"Slicing" and using a "shortened hitting action" are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt "sliced dropshot" will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create "spinning netshots" (also called "tumbling netshots"), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning netshot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning netshots are especially important for high level singles players.

The lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold his racquet ready for a netshot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when she or he notices the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played. A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground. This makes the opponent's task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when he has no time for a big arm swing. A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as "finger power". Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a racquet swing.

It is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rearcourt (for example, dropshots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as netshots).

Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use "double motion", where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction. Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction. The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke cross court, or vice versa. "Triple motion" is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a "racquet head fake", where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction, but does not require as much time.

To win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a netshot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the netshot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.

Deception is also important. Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical, and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change his body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.

Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.

In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.

At high levels of play, singles demands extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.

Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rearcourt, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rearcourt attacker plays a dropshot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.

At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.

At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles is the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges. Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men's doubles than for singles.

In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can therefore produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.

At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in the back.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF) is the internationally recognized governing body of the sport responsible for conduction of tournaments and approaching fair play. Five regional confederations are associated with the BWF:


The BWF organizes several international competitions, including the <a href="Thomas%20Cup">Thomas Cup</a>, the premier men's international team event first held in <a href="1949%20Thomas%20Cup">1948–1949</a>, and the <a href="Uber%20Cup">Uber Cup</a>, the women's equivalent first held in <a href="1957%20Uber%20Cup">1956–1957</a>. The competitions now take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004. It was further increased to 16 teams in 2012.

The <a href="Sudirman%20Cup">Sudirman Cup</a>, a gender-mixed international team event held once every two years, began in 1989. Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament, a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men's doubles and singles, women's doubles and singles, and mixed doubles). Like <a href="association%20football">association football</a> (soccer), it features a promotion and relegation system in every level. However, the system was last used in <a href="2009%20Sudirman%20Cup">2009</a> and teams competing will now grouped by world rankings.

Badminton was a demonstration event in the <a href="1972%20Summer%20Olympics">1972</a> and <a href="1988%20Summer%20Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a>. It became an official <a href="Badminton%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Summer Olympic</a> sport at the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">Barcelona Olympics</a> in <a href="Badminton%20at%20the%201992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992</a> and its gold medals now generally rate as the sport's most coveted prizes for individual players.

In the <a href="BWF%20World%20Championships">BWF World Championships</a>, first held in <a href="1977%20IBF%20World%20Championships">1977</a>, currently only the highest ranked 64 players in the world, and a maximum of four from each country, can participate in any category. In both the Olympic and BWF World competitions restrictions on the number of participants from any one country have caused some controversy because they sometimes result in excluding elite world level players from the strongest badminton nations. The Thomas, Uber, and Sudirman Cups, the Olympics, and the BWF World (and <a href="BWF%20World%20Junior%20Championships">World Junior Championships</a>), are all categorized as level one tournaments.

At the start of 2007, the BWF introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level tournaments aside from those in level one: the <a href="BWF%20Super%20Series">BWF Super Series</a>. This level two tournament series, a tour for the world's elite players, stages twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Finals held at the year end. Among the tournaments in this series is the venerable <a href="All%20England%20Open%20Badminton%20Championships">All-England Championships</a>, first held in 1900, which was once considered the unofficial world championships of the sport.

Level three tournaments consist of <a href="BWF%20Grand%20Prix%20Gold%20and%20Grand%20Prix">Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix event</a>. Top players can collect the world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments. These include the regional competitions in Asia (<a href="Badminton%20Asia%20Championships">Badminton Asia Championships</a>) and Europe (<a href="European%20Badminton%20Championships">European Badminton Championships</a>), which produce the world's best players as well as the <a href="Pan%20Am%20Badminton%20Championships">Pan America Badminton Championships</a>.

The level four tournaments, known as International Challenge, International Series, and Future Series, encourage participation by junior players.

Badminton is frequently compared to tennis. The following is a list of manifest differences:

Statistics such as the smash speed, above, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport. Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racquet sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve.

While fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games. No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during game play.

Badminton and tennis techniques differ substantially. The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton racquets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racquet swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than . For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racquet swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.

Baroque

The Baroque ( or ) is a period of artistic <a href="Style%20%28visual%20arts%29">style</a> that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theatre, and music. The style began around 1600 in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, and spread to most of Europe.

The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, which had decided at the time of the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>, in response to the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement. The <a href="nobility">aristocracy</a> viewed the dramatic style of Baroque art and architecture as a means of impressing visitors by projecting triumph, power, and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases, and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence. However, "baroque" has a resonance and application that extend beyond a simple reduction to either a style or period.

The French word "baroque" is derived from the Portuguese word "barroco" or Spanish "barrueco", both of which refer to a "rough or imperfect <a href="pearl">pearl</a>", though whether it entered those languages via Latin, Arabic, or some other source is uncertain. It is also yields the Italian "barocco" and modern Spanish "barroco", German "Barock", Dutch "Barok", and so on. The 1911 <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition">"Encyclopædia Britannica" 11th edition</a> thought the term was derived from the Spanish "barrueco", a large, irregularly-shaped pearl, and that it had for a time been confined to the craft of the jeweller. Others derive it from the <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> term <a href="Syllogism%23Baroco%20%28AOO-2%29">"Baroco", a supposedly laboured form of syllogism</a> in logical "Scholastica". The Latin root can be found in "bis-roca".

In informal usage, the word "baroque" can simply mean that something is "elaborate", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the 17th and 18th centuries.

The word "Baroque", like most <a href="Periodization">periodic</a> or stylistic designations, was invented by later critics rather than practitioners of the arts in the 17th and early 18th centuries. It is a French transliteration of the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> phrase "pérola barroca", which means "irregular <a href="pearl">pearl</a>", and natural pearls that deviate from the usual, regular forms so they do not have an <a href="axis%20of%20rotation">axis of rotation</a> are known as "<a href="baroque%20pearl">baroque pearl</a>s".

The term "Baroque" was initially used in a derogatory sense, to underline the excesses of its emphasis. In particular, the term was used to describe its eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details, which sharply contrasted the clear and sober rationality of the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. Although it was long thought that the word as a critical term was first applied to architecture, in fact it appears earlier in reference to music. In an anonymous satirical review of the première of <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Jean-Philippe Rameau</a>'s "<a href="Hippolyte%20et%20Aricie">Hippolyte et Aricie</a>" in October 1733, which was printed in the "<a href="Mercure%20de%20France">Mercure de France</a>" in May 1734, the critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.

Another hypothesis says that the word comes from precursors of the style: <a href="Giacomo%20Barozzi%20da%20Vignola">Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola</a> and <a href="Federico%20Barocci">Federico Barocci</a>.

The <a href="Switzerland">Swiss-born</a> <a href="Art%20History">art historian</a> <a href="Heinrich%20W%C3%B6lfflin">Heinrich Wölfflin</a> (1864–1945) started the rehabilitation of the word "Baroque" in his "Renaissance und Barock" (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a> and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Long despised, Baroque art and architecture became fashionable <a href="Interwar%20period">between the two World Wars</a>, and has largely remained in critical favour. For example, the often extreme <a href="Sicilian%20Baroque">Sicilian Baroque</a> architecture is today recognised largely due to the work of Sir <a href="Sacheverall%20Sitwell">Sacheverall Sitwell</a>, whose "Southern Baroque Art" of 1924 was the first book to appreciate the style, followed by the more academic work of <a href="Anthony%20Blunt">Anthony Blunt</a>. In painting the gradual rise in popular esteem of <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a> has been the best barometer of modern taste.

In <a href="art%20history">art history</a> it has become common to recognise "Baroque" stylistic phases, characterised by energetic movement and display, in earlier art, so that <a href="John%20Boardman%20%28art%20historian%29">Sir John Boardman</a> describes the ancient sculpture "<a href="Laoco%C3%B6n%20and%20His%20Sons">Laocoön and His Sons</a>" as "one of the finest examples of the <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Hellenistic</a> baroque", and a later phase of Imperial Roman sculpture is also often called "Baroque". <a href="William%20Watson%20%28sinologist%29">William Watson</a> describes a late phase of <a href="Shang-dynasty">Shang-dynasty</a> <a href="Chinese%20ritual%20bronze">Chinese ritual bronze</a>s of the 11th century BC as "baroque".

The term "Baroque" may still be used, usually pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line.

The Baroque originated around 1600, several decades after the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a> (1545–63), by which the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> answered many questions of internal reform and formulated policy on the representational arts by demanding that paintings and sculptures in church contexts should speak to the illiterate rather than to the well-informed. Many <a href="Art%20history">art historians</a> see this turn toward a populist conception of the function of ecclesiastical art as driving the innovations of <a href="Michelangelo%20Merisi">Caravaggio</a> and of the brothers <a href="Agostino%20Carracci">Agostino</a> and <a href="Annibale%20Carracci">Annibale Carracci</a>, all of whom were working (and competing for commissions) in Rome around 1600.

The appeal of Baroque style turned consciously from the witty, intellectual qualities of 16th-century <a href="Mannerism">Mannerist</a> art to a visceral appeal aimed at the senses. It employed an <a href="iconography">iconography</a> that was direct, simple, obvious, and theatrical. Baroque art drew on certain broad and heroic tendencies in <a href="Annibale%20Carracci">Annibale Carracci</a> and his circle, and found inspiration in other artists like <a href="Antonio%20da%20Correggio">Correggio</a> and <a href="Michelangelo%20Merisi">Caravaggio</a> and <a href="Federico%20Barocci">Federico Barocci</a>, nowadays sometimes termed 'proto-Baroque'. Germinal ideas of the Baroque can also be found in the work of <a href="Michelangelo%20Buonarroti">Michelangelo</a>. Some general parallels in music make the expression "<a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque music</a>" useful: there are contrasting phrase lengths, harmony and <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> have ousted <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a>, and orchestral colour makes a stronger appearance. Even more generalised parallels perceived by some experts in philosophy, prose style and poetry, are harder to pinpoint.

Though Baroque was superseded in many centers by the <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> style, beginning in France in the late 1720s, especially for interiors, paintings and the decorative arts, the Baroque style continued in use in architecture until the advent of <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassicism</a> in the later 18th century. See the Neapolitan palace of <a href="Caserta">Caserta</a>, a Baroque palace (though in a chaste exterior) whose construction began in 1752.

In paintings Baroque gestures are broader than Mannerist gestures: less ambiguous, less arcane and mysterious, more like the stage gestures of <a href="opera">opera</a>, a major Baroque art-form. Baroque poses depend on "contrapposto" ("counterpoise"), the tension within the figures that move the planes of shoulders and hips in counterdirections. (See Bernini's "David".)

The dryer, less dramatic and colouristic, chastened later stages of 18th century Baroque architectural style are often seen as a separate Late Baroque manifestation, for example in buildings by <a href="Claude%20Perrault">Claude Perrault</a>. Academic characteristics in the neo-<a href="Palladian">Palladian</a> style, epitomised by <a href="William%20Kent">William Kent</a>, show a parallel development in Britain and the British colonies: within interiors, Kent's furniture designs are vividly influenced by the Baroque furniture of Rome and Genoa, hierarchical tectonic sculptural elements, meant never to be moved from their positions, completed the wall decoration. Baroque is a style of unity imposed upon rich, heavy detail.

<a href="Heinrich%20W%C3%B6lfflin">Heinrich Wölfflin</a> defined the Baroque as the age where the oval replaced the circle as the center of composition, where centralization replaced balance, and where colouristic and "painterly" effects began to become more prominent.
Art historians, often <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> ones, have traditionally emphasized that the Baroque style evolved during a time in which the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> had to react against the many revolutionary cultural movements that produced a new science and new forms of <a href="religion">religion</a> — the <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a>. It has been said that the monumental Baroque is a style that could give the <a href="Papacy">Papacy</a>, like <a href="political%20absolutism">secular absolute monarchies</a>, a formal, imposing way of expression that could restore its prestige, at the point of becoming somehow symbolic of the <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a>.

Whatever the truth of this interpretation, the Baroque was successfully developed in Rome, where Baroque architecture widely renewed the central areas with perhaps the most important urbanistic revision.

The Baroque era is sometimes divided into <a href="Italian%20Baroque%20art">three approximate phases</a> for convenience:


The term "Late Baroque" is also sometimes used synonymously with the succeeding <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> movement.

A defining statement of what "Baroque" signifies in painting is provided by the series of paintings executed by <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a> for <a href="Marie%20de%20Medici">Marie de Medici</a> at the <a href="Luxembourg%20Palace">Luxembourg Palace</a> in Paris (now at the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>), in which a Catholic painter satisfied a Catholic patron: Baroque-era conceptions of monarchy, iconography, handling of paint, and compositions as well as the depiction of space and movement.

Baroque style featured "exaggerated lighting, intense emotions, release from restraint, and even a kind of artistic sensationalism". Baroque art did not really depict the life style of the people at that time; however, "closely tied to the Counter-Reformation, this style melodramatically reaffirmed the emotional depths of the Catholic faith and glorified both church and monarchy" of their power and influence.

There were highly diverse strands of Italian baroque painting, from <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a> to <a href="Pietro%20da%20Cortona">Cortona</a>; both approaching emotive dynamism with different styles. The most prominent Spanish painter of the Baroque was <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Diego Velázquez</a>.

Another frequently cited work of Baroque art is <a href="Bernini">Bernini</a>'s "<a href="Saint%20Theresa%20in%20Ecstasy">Saint Theresa in Ecstasy</a>" for the Cornaro chapel in Saint Maria della Vittoria, which brings together architecture, sculpture, and theatre into one grand conceit.

The later Baroque style gradually gave way to a more decorative <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a>.

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th century <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age%20painting">Dutch Golden Age painting</a>, which had very little religious art, and little <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>, instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as <a href="still%20life">still life</a>, <a href="genre%20painting">genre painting</a>s of everyday scenes, and <a href="landscape%20painting">landscape painting</a>. While the Baroque nature of <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>'s art is clear, the label is less often used for <a href="Vermeer">Vermeer</a> and many other Dutch artists. <a href="Flemish%20Baroque%20painting">Flemish Baroque painting</a> shared a part in this trend, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories.

In a similar way the French classical style of painting exemplified by <a href="Poussin">Poussin</a> is often classed as Baroque, and does share many qualities of the Italian painting of the same period, although the poise and restraint derived from following classical ideas typically give it a very different overall mood.

In Baroque sculpture, groups of figures assumed new importance and there was a dynamic movement and energy of human forms—they spiraled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space. For the first time, Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles. The characteristic Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water <a href="fountains">fountains</a>. <a href="Aleijadinho">Aleijadinho</a> in Brazil was also one of the great names of baroque sculpture, and his master work is the set of statues of the "Santuário de Bom Jesus de Matosinhos" in <a href="Congonhas">Congonhas</a>. The soapstone sculptures of old testament prophets around the terrace are considered amongst his finest work.

The architecture, sculpture and fountains of <a href="Gian%20Lorenzo%20Bernini">Bernini</a> (1598–1680) give highly charged characteristics of Baroque style. Bernini was undoubtedly the most important sculptor of the Baroque period. He approached <a href="Michelangelo%20Buonarroti">Michelangelo</a> in his omnicompetence: Bernini sculpted, worked as an architect, painted, wrote plays, and staged spectacles. In the late 20th century Bernini was most valued for his sculpture, both for his virtuosity in carving marble and his ability to create figures that combine the physical and the spiritual. He was also a fine sculptor of bust portraits in high demand among the powerful.

A good example of Bernini's Baroque work is his "<a href="Ecstasy%20of%20St%20Teresa">Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</a>" (1645–52), created for the Cornaro Chapel of the church of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20della%20Vittoria">Santa Maria della Vittoria</a>, Rome. Bernini designed the entire chapel, a subsidiary space along the side of the church, for the Cornaro family.

<a href="Teresa%20of%20%C3%81vila">Saint Teresa</a>, the focal point of the chapel, is a soft white marble statue surrounded by a polychromatic marble architectural framing. This structure conceals a window that lights the statue from above. Figure-groups of the Cornaro family sculpted in shallow relief inhabit opera boxes on the two side walls of the chapel. The setting places the viewer as a spectator in front of the statue with the Cornaro family leaning out of their box seats and craning forward to see the mystical ecstasy of the saint.

St. Theresa is highly idealised and in an imaginary setting. She was a popular saint of the <a href="Catholic%20Reformation">Catholic Reformation</a>. She wrote of her mystical experiences for an audience of the nuns of her <a href="Carmelite%20Order">Carmelite Order</a>; these writings had become popular reading among lay people interested in spirituality. In her writings, she described the love of God as piercing her heart like a burning arrow. Bernini materialises this by placing St. Theresa on a butt while a Cupid figure holds a golden arrow made of metal and smiles down at her. The angelic figure is not preparing to plunge the arrow into her heart—rather, he has withdrawn it. St. Theresa's face reflects not the anticipation of ecstasy, but her current fulfillment.

This work is widely considered a masterpiece of the Baroque, although the mix of religious and erotic imagery (faithful to St. Teresa's own written account) may raise modern eyebrows. However, Bernini was a devout Catholic and was not attempting to satirize the experience of a <a href="celibacy">chaste</a> nun. Rather, he aimed to portray religious experience as an intensely physical one. Theresa described her bodily reaction to spiritual enlightenment in a language of ecstasy used by many mystics, and Bernini's depiction is earnest.

The Cornaro family promotes itself discreetly in this chapel. They are represented visually, but are placed on the sides of the chapel, witnessing the event from balconies. As in an <a href="opera%20house">opera house</a>, the Cornaro have a privileged position in respect to the viewer, in their private reserve, closer to the saint; the viewer, however, has a better view from the front. They attach their name to the chapel, but St. Theresa is the focus. It is a private chapel in the sense that no one could say mass on the altar beneath the statue (in the 17th century and probably through the 19th) without permission from the family, but the only thing that divides the viewer from the image is the altar rail. The spectacle functions both as a demonstration of mysticism and as a piece of family pride.

In Baroque architecture, new emphasis was placed on bold <a href="massing">massing</a>, <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a>s, <a href="dome">dome</a>s, light-and-shade ("<a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>"), 'painterly' colour effects, and the bold play of volume and void. In interiors, Baroque movement around and through a void informed monumental staircases that had no parallel in previous architecture. The other Baroque innovation in worldly interiors was the state apartment, a sequence of increasingly rich interiors that culminated in a presence chamber or throne room or a state bedroom. The sequence of monumental stairs followed by a state apartment was copied in smaller scale everywhere in aristocratic dwellings of any pretensions.

Baroque architecture was taken up with enthusiasm in central Germany (see, e.g., <a href="Ludwigsburg%20Palace">Ludwigsburg Palace</a> and <a href="Zwinger%2C%20Dresden">Zwinger, Dresden</a>), <a href="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a> (see, e.g., <a href="Peterhof%20Palace">Peterhof</a>). In England the culmination of Baroque architecture was embodied in work by Sir <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>, Sir <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20Hawksmoor">Nicholas Hawksmoor</a>, from ca. 1660 to ca. 1725. Many examples of Baroque architecture and town planning are found in other European towns, and in Latin America. Town planning of this period featured radiating avenues intersecting in squares, which took cues from <a href="History%20of%20gardening">Baroque garden plans</a>. In Sicily, Baroque developed new shapes and themes as in Noto, <a href="Ragusa%2C%20Italy">Ragusa</a> and <a href="Acireale">Acireale</a> "Basilica di San Sebastiano".

Another example of Baroque architecture is the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Morelia">Cathedral of Morelia</a>, in <a href="Michoac%C3%A1n">Michoacán</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Built in the 17th century by Vincenzo Barrochio, it is one of the many Baroque cathedrals in Mexico. Baroque churches built during the Spanish period are also seen in other former colonies of Spain.

<a href="Frank%20Ching">Francis Ching</a> described Baroque architecture as "a style of architecture originating in Italy in the early 17th century and variously prevalent in Europe and the New World for a century and a half, characterised by free and sculptural use of the classical orders and ornament, dynamic opposition and interpenetration of spaces, and the dramatic combined effects of architecture, sculpture, painting, and the decorative arts."

In theatre, the elaborate conceits, multiplicity of plot turns and a variety of situations characteristic of <a href="Mannerism">Mannerism</a>, in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare's tragedies</a> for instance, were superseded by <a href="opera">opera</a>, which drew together all the arts into a unified whole.

Theatre evolved in the Baroque era and became a <a href="multimedia">multimedia</a> experience, starting with the actual architectural space. In fact, much of the technology used in current Broadway or commercial plays was invented and developed during this era. The stage could change from a romantic garden to the interior of a palace in a matter of seconds. The entire space became a framed selected area that only allows the users to see a specific action, hiding all the machinery and technology – mostly ropes and pulleys.

This technology affected the content of the narrated or performed pieces, practicing at its best the <a href="Deus%20ex%20Machina">Deus ex Machina</a> solution. Gods were finally able to come down – literally – from the heavens and rescue the hero in the most extreme and dangerous, even absurd situations.

The term Theatrum Mundi – the world is a stage – was also created. The social and political realm in the real world is manipulated in exactly the same way the actor and the machines are presenting and limiting what is being presented on stage, hiding selectively all the machinery that makes the actions happen.

The films "<a href="Vatel%20%28film%29">Vatel</a>" and "<a href="Farinelli%20%28film%29">Farinelli</a>" give a good idea of the style of productions of the Baroque period. The American musician <a href="William%20Christie%20%28musician%29">William Christie</a> and <a href="Les%20Arts%20Florissants%20%28ensemble%29">Les Arts Florissants</a> have performed extensive research on all the French Baroque Opera, performing pieces from <a href="Marc-Antoine%20Charpentier">Charpentier</a> and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Lully</a>, among others that are extremely faithful to the original 17th-century creations.

The influence of the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> was also very late in England, and Baroque theatre is only partly a useful concept here, for example in discussing <a href="Restoration%20comedy">Restoration comedy</a>. There was an 18-year break when the London theatres were closed during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> and <a href="English%20Commonwealth">English Commonwealth</a> until the <a href="Restoration%20of%20Charles%20II">Restoration of Charles II</a> in 1660.

German theatre in the 17th century lacked major contributions. The best known playwright was <a href="Andreas%20Gryphius">Andreas Gryphius</a>, who used the <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> model of the <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> <a href="Joost%20van%20den%20Vondel">Joost van den Vondel</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Corneille">Pierre Corneille</a>. There was also <a href="Johannes%20Velten">Johannes Velten</a> who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the <a href="commedia%20del%27arte">commedia del'arte</a> with the classic theatre of Corneille and <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.

The Baroque had a Catholic and conservative character in Spain, following an Italian literary models during the Renaissance. The Hispanic Baroque theatre aimed for a public content with an ideal reality that manifested fundamental three sentiments: Catholic religion, monarchist and national pride and honour originating from the chivalric, knightly world.

Two periods are known in the Baroque Spanish theatre, with the division occurring in 1630. The first period is represented chiefly by <a href="Lope%20de%20Vega">Lope de Vega</a>, but also by <a href="Tirso%20de%20Molina">Tirso de Molina</a>, <a href="Gaspar%20Aguilar">Gaspar Aguilar</a>, <a href="Guill%C3%A9n%20de%20Castro">Guillén de Castro</a>, <a href="Antonio%20Mira%20de%20Amescua">Antonio Mira de Amescua</a>, <a href="Luis%20V%C3%A9lez%20de%20Guevara">Luis Vélez de Guevara</a>, <a href="Juan%20Ruiz%20de%20Alarc%C3%B3n">Juan Ruiz de Alarcón</a>, <a href="Diego%20Jim%C3%A9nez%20de%20Enciso">Diego Jiménez de Enciso</a>, <a href="Luis%20Belmonte%20Berm%C3%BAdez">Luis Belmonte Bermúdez</a>, <a href="Felipe%20God%C3%ADnez">Felipe Godínez</a>, <a href="Luis%20Qui%C3%B1ones%20de%20Benavente">Luis Quiñones de Benavente</a> or <a href="Juan%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Montalb%C3%A1n">Juan Pérez de Montalbán</a>. The second period is represented by <a href="Pedro%20Calder%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Barca">Pedro Calderón de la Barca</a> and fellow dramatists <a href="Antonio%20Hurtado%20de%20Mendoza">Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza</a>, <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Cubillo%20de%20Arag%C3%B3n">Álvaro Cubillo de Aragón</a>, <a href="Jer%C3%B3nimo%20de%20C%C3%A1ncer">Jerónimo de Cáncer</a>, <a href="Francisco%20de%20Rojas%20Zorrilla">Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla</a>, <a href="Juan%20de%20Matos%20Fragoso">Juan de Matos Fragoso</a>, <a href="Antonio%20Coello%20y%20Ochoa">Antonio Coello y Ochoa</a>, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Moreto">Agustín Moreto</a>, and <a href="Francisco%20Bances%20Candamo">Francisco Bances Candamo</a>. These classifications are loose because each author had his own way and could occasionally adhere himself to the formula established by Lope. It may even be that the "manner" of Lope was more liberal and structured than Calderón's.

Lope de Vega introduced through his "Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo" (1609) the "new comedy". He established a new dramatic formula that broke the three <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> unities of the Italian school of poetry (action, time and place) and a fourth unity of Aristotle which is about style, mixing of tragic and comic elements showing different types of verses and stanzas upon what is represented. Although Lope has a great knowledge of the plastic arts, he did not use it during the major part of his career nor in theatre or scenography. The Lope's comedy granted a second role to the visual aspects of the theatrical representation.

Tirso de Molina, Lope de Vega, and Calderón were the most important play writers in Golden Era Spain. Their works, known for their subtle intelligence and profound comprehension of a person's humanity, could be considered a bridge between Lope's primitive comedy and the more elaborate comedy of Calderón. Tirso de Molina is best known for two works, "The Convicted Suspicions" and "<a href="The%20Trickster%20of%20Seville">The Trickster of Seville</a>", one of the first versions of the <a href="Don%20Juan">Don Juan</a> myth.

Upon his arrival to Madrid, <a href="Cosimo%20Lotti">Cosimo Lotti</a> brought to the Spanish court the most advanced theatrical techniques of Europe. His techniques and mechanic knowledge were applied in palace exhibitions called "Fiestas" and in lavish exhibitions of rivers or artificial fountains called "Naumaquias". He was in charge of styling the Gardens of <a href="Buen%20Retiro">Buen Retiro</a>, of <a href="Palace%20of%20Zarzuela">Zarzuela</a> and of <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Aranjuez">Aranjuez</a> and the construction of the theatrical building of Coliseo del Buen Retiro. Lope's formulas begins with a verse that it unbefitting of the palace theatre foundation and the birth of new concepts that begun the careers of some play writers like Calderón de la Barca. Marking the principal innovations of the New Lopesian Comedy, Calderón's style marked many differences, with a great deal of constructive care and attention to his internal structure. Calderón's work is in formal perfection and a very lyric and symbolic language. Liberty, vitality and openness of Lope gave a step to Calderón's intellectual reflection and formal precision. In his comedy it reflected his ideological and doctrine intentions in above the passion and the action, the work of <a href="Autos%20sacramentales">Autos sacramentales</a> achieved high ranks. The genre of Comedia is political, multi-artistic and in a sense hybrid. The poetic text interweaved with Medias and resources originating from architecture, music and painting freeing the deception that is in the Lopesian comedy was made up from the lack of scenery and engaging the dialogue of action.

The most important English authors of the 17th century were playwright <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> and epic poet <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>.

In France it was a brilliant period known as <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Grand Siècle</a>. <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Corneille">Pierre Corneille</a> and <a href="Jean%20Racine">Jean Racine</a> wrote famous plays while <a href="Jean%20de%20La%20Fontaine">Jean de La Fontaine</a> and <a href="Charles%20Perrault">Charles Perrault</a> – fables.

Baroque was the greatest era in the history of Spanish literature which is called <a href="Spanish%20Golden%20Age">Siglo de Oro</a> with playwrights <a href="Pedro%20Calderon%20de%20la%20Barca">Pedro Calderon de la Barca</a> and <a href="Lope%20de%20Vega">Lope de Vega</a>, poet <a href="Juana%20In%C3%A9s%20de%20la%20Cruz">Juana Inés de la Cruz</a> as well as <a href="Miguel%20de%20Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a> who is regarded as the first novelist.

<a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a>, <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>, <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>, <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>, <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> and <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> are the most appreciated thinkers of the 17th century. This period was characterised by mixing new ideas with religious tradition. Neostoicism of <a href="Justus%20Lipsius">Justus Lipsius</a>, scholasticism of <a href="Francisco%20Su%C3%A1rez">Francisco Suárez</a> and casuistry of <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a> were predominant.

The term "Baroque" is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art, but usually encompasses a slightly later period.

It is a still-debated question as to what extent Baroque music shares aesthetic principles with the visual and literary arts of the Baroque period. A fairly clear, shared element is a love of <a href="Ornament%20%28art%29">ornamentation</a>, and it is perhaps significant that the role of ornament was greatly diminished in both music and architecture as the Baroque gave way to the Classical period.

The application of the term "Baroque" to music is a relatively recent development, although it has recently been pointed out that the first use of the word "baroque" in criticism of any of the arts related to music, in an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau's "<a href="Hippolyte%20et%20Aricie">Hippolyte et Aricie</a>," printed in the "Mercure de France" in May 1734. The critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque," complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.

However this was an isolated reference, and consistent use of the term as a period designator was only begun in 1919, by <a href="Curt%20Sachs">Curt Sachs</a>, and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English (in an article published by <a href="Manfred%20Bukofzer">Manfred Bukofzer</a>).

Many musical forms were born in that era, like the <a href="concerto">concerto</a> and <a href="sinfonia">sinfonia</a>. Forms such as the <a href="sonata">sonata</a>, <a href="cantata">cantata</a> and <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> flourished. Also, opera was born out of the experimentation of the <a href="Florentine%20Camerata">Florentine Camerata</a>, the creators of <a href="monody">monody</a>, who attempted to recreate the theatrical arts of the Ancient Greeks. An important technique used in baroque music was the use of <a href="ground%20bass">ground bass</a>, a repeated bass line. "Dido's Lament" by <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a> is a famous example of this technique.

Boolean algebra (structure)

In <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, a Boolean algebra or Boolean lattice is a <a href="complemented%20lattice">complemented</a> <a href="distributive%20lattice">distributive lattice</a>. This type of <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a> captures essential properties of both <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> operations and <a href="logic">logic</a> operations. A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a <a href="power%20set">power set</a> algebra or a <a href="field%20of%20sets">field of sets</a>, or its elements can be viewed as generalized <a href="truth%20value">truth value</a>s. It is also a special case of a <a href="De%20Morgan%20algebra">De Morgan algebra</a> and a <a href="Kleene%20algebra%20%28with%20involution%29">Kleene algebra (with involution)</a>.

Every Boolean algebra <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29%23Boolean%20rings">gives rise</a> to a <a href="Boolean%20ring">Boolean ring</a>, and vice versa, with ring multiplication corresponding to <a href="logical%20conjunction">conjunction</a> or <a href="meet%20%28mathematics%29">meet</a> ∧, and ring addition to <a href="exclusive%20or">exclusive disjunction</a> or <a href="symmetric%20difference">symmetric difference</a> (not <a href="logical%20disjunction">disjunction</a> ∨). However, the theory of Boolean rings has an inherent asymmetry between the two operators, while the axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra express the symmetry of the theory described by the <a href="Duality%20principle%20%28Boolean%20algebra%29">duality principle</a>.

The term "Boolean algebra" honors <a href="George%20Boole">George Boole</a> (1815–1864), a self-educated English mathematician. He introduced the <a href="algebraic%20system">algebraic system</a> initially in a small pamphlet, "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic", published in 1847 in response to an ongoing public controversy between <a href="Augustus%20De%20Morgan">Augustus De Morgan</a> and <a href="Sir%20William%20Hamilton%2C%209th%20Baronet">William Hamilton</a>, and later as a more substantial book, "<a href="The%20Laws%20of%20Thought">The Laws of Thought</a>", published in 1854. Boole's formulation differs from that described above in some important respects. For example, conjunction and disjunction in Boole were not a dual pair of operations. Boolean algebra emerged in the 1860s, in papers written by <a href="William%20Jevons">William Jevons</a> and <a href="Charles%20Sanders%20Peirce">Charles Sanders Peirce</a>. The first systematic presentation of Boolean algebra and <a href="distributive%20lattice">distributive lattice</a>s is owed to the 1890 "Vorlesungen" of <a href="Ernst%20Schr%C3%B6der">Ernst Schröder</a>. The first extensive treatment of Boolean algebra in English is <a href="A.%20N.%20Whitehead">A. N. Whitehead</a>'s 1898 "Universal Algebra". Boolean algebra as an axiomatic algebraic structure in the modern axiomatic sense begins with a 1904 paper by <a href="Edward%20V.%20Huntington">Edward V. Huntington</a>. Boolean algebra came of age as serious mathematics with the work of <a href="Marshall%20Stone">Marshall Stone</a> in the 1930s, and with <a href="Garrett%20Birkhoff">Garrett Birkhoff</a>'s 1940 "Lattice Theory". In the 1960s, <a href="Paul%20Cohen%20%28mathematician%29">Paul Cohen</a>, <a href="Dana%20Scott">Dana Scott</a>, and others found deep new results in <a href="mathematical%20logic">mathematical logic</a> and <a href="axiomatic%20set%20theory">axiomatic set theory</a> using offshoots of Boolean algebra, namely <a href="forcing%20%28mathematics%29">forcing</a> and <a href="Boolean-valued%20model">Boolean-valued model</a>s.

A Boolean algebra is a six-<a href="tuple">tuple</a> consisting of a <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> "A", equipped with two <a href="binary%20operation">binary operation</a>s ∧ (called "meet" or "and"), ∨ (called "join" or "or"), a <a href="unary%20operation">unary operation</a> ¬ (called "complement" or "not") and two elements 0 and 1 (called "bottom" and "top", or "least" and "greatest" element, also denoted by the symbols ⊥ and ⊤, respectively), such that for all elements "a", "b" and "c" of "A", the following <a href="axiom">axiom</a>s hold:
Note, however, that the absorption law can be excluded from the set of axioms as it can be derived from the other axioms (see <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29%23Axiomatics">Proven properties</a>).

A Boolean algebra with only one element is called a trivial Boolean algebra or a degenerate Boolean algebra. (Some authors require 0 and 1 to be "distinct" elements in order to exclude this case.)

It follows from the last three pairs of axioms above (identity, distributivity and complements), or from the absorption axiom, that
The relation ≤ defined by "a" ≤ "b" if these equivalent conditions hold, is a <a href="partial%20order">partial order</a> with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet "a" ∧ "b" and the join "a" ∨ "b" of two elements coincide with their <a href="infimum">infimum</a> and <a href="supremum">supremum</a>, respectively, with respect to ≤.

The first four pairs of axioms constitute a definition of a <a href="bounded%20lattice">bounded lattice</a>.

It follows from the first five pairs of axioms that any complement is unique.

The set of axioms is <a href="duality%20%28order%20theory%29">self-dual</a> in the sense that if one exchanges ∨ with ∧ and 0 with 1 in an axiom, the result is again an axiom. Therefore, by applying this operation to a Boolean algebra (or Boolean lattice), one obtains another Boolean algebra with the same elements; it is called its dual.




A "<a href="homomorphism">homomorphism</a>" between two Boolean algebras "A" and "B" is a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> "f" : "A" → "B" such that for all "a", "b" in "A":

It then follows that "f"(¬"a") = ¬"f"("a") for all "a" in "A". The <a href="class%20%28set%20theory%29">class</a> of all Boolean algebras, together with this notion of morphism, forms a <a href="full%20subcategory">full subcategory</a> of the <a href="category%20theory">category</a> of lattices.

Every Boolean algebra (A, ∧, ∨) gives rise to a <a href="ring%20%28algebra%29">ring</a> ("A", +, ·) by defining "a" + "b" := ("a" ∧ ¬"b") ∨ ("b" ∧ ¬"a") = ("a" ∨ "b") ∧ ¬("a" ∧ "b") (this operation is called <a href="symmetric%20difference">symmetric difference</a> in the case of sets and <a href="Truth%20table%23Exclusive%20disjunction">XOR</a> in the case of logic) and "a" · "b" := "a" ∧ "b". The zero element of this ring coincides with the 0 of the Boolean algebra; the multiplicative identity element of the ring is the 1 of the Boolean algebra. This ring has the property that "a" · "a" = "a" for all "a" in "A"; rings with this property are called <a href="Boolean%20ring">Boolean ring</a>s.

Conversely, if a Boolean ring "A" is given, we can turn it into a Boolean algebra by defining "x" ∨ "y" := "x" + "y" + ("x" · "y") and "x" ∧ "y" := "x" · "y".

Since these two constructions are inverses of each other, we can say that every Boolean ring arises from a Boolean algebra, and vice versa. Furthermore, a map "f" : "A" → "B" is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras if and only if it is a homomorphism of Boolean rings. The <a href="category%20theory">categories</a> of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras are equivalent.

Hsiang (1985) gave a <a href="Abstract%20rewriting%20system">rule-based algorithm</a> to <a href="Word%20problem%20%28mathematics%29">check</a> whether two arbitrary expressions denote the same value in every Boolean ring.

More generally, Boudet, <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Jouannaud">Jouannaud</a>, and Schmidt-Schauß (1989) gave an algorithm to <a href="Unification%20%28computer%20science%29%23Particular%20background%20knowledge%20sets%20E">solve equations</a> between arbitrary Boolean-ring expressions.
Employing the similarity of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras, both algorithms have applications in <a href="automated%20theorem%20proving">automated theorem proving</a>.

An "ideal" of the Boolean algebra "A" is a subset "I" such that for all "x", "y" in "I" we have x ∨ y in "I" and for all "a" in "A" we have "a" ∧ "x" in "I". This notion of ideal coincides with the notion of <a href="ring%20ideal">ring ideal</a> in the Boolean ring "A". An ideal "I" of "A" is called "prime" if "I" ≠ "A" and if "a" ∧ "b" in "I" always implies "a" in "I" or "b" in "I". Furthermore, for every "a" ∈ "A" we have that "a" ∧ "-a" = 0 ∈ "I" and then "a" ∈ "I" or "-a" ∈ "I" for every "a" ∈ "A", if "I" is prime. An ideal "I" of "A" is called "maximal" if "I" ≠ "A" and if the only ideal properly containing "I" is "A" itself. For an ideal "I", if "a" ∉ "I" and "-a" ∉ "I", then "I" ∪ {"a"} or "I" ∪ {"-a"} is properly contained in another ideal "J". Hence, that an "I" is not maximal and therefore the notions of prime ideal and maximal ideal are equivalent in Boolean algebras. Moreover, these notions coincide with ring theoretic ones of <a href="prime%20ideal">prime ideal</a> and <a href="maximal%20ideal">maximal ideal</a> in the Boolean ring "A".

The dual of an "ideal" is a "filter". A "filter" of the Boolean algebra "A" is a subset "p" such that for all "x", "y" in "p" we have "x" ∧ "y" in "p" and for all "a" in "A" we have "a" ∨ "x" in "p". The dual of a "maximal" (or "prime") "ideal" in a Boolean algebra is "<a href="ultrafilter">ultrafilter</a>". Ultrafilters can alternatively be described as <a href="2-valued%20morphism">2-valued morphism</a>s from "A" to the two-element Boolean algebra. The statement "every filter in a Boolean algebra can be extended to an ultrafilter" is called the "<a href="Boolean%20prime%20ideal%20theorem%23The%20ultrafilter%20lemma">Ultrafilter Theorem</a>" and can not be proved in <a href="Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel%20set%20theory">ZF</a>, if <a href="Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel%20set%20theory">ZF</a> is <a href="consistent">consistent</a>. Within ZF, it is strictly weaker than the <a href="axiom%20of%20choice">axiom of choice</a>.
The Ultrafilter Theorem has many equivalent formulations: "every Boolean algebra has an ultrafilter", "every ideal in a Boolean algebra can be extended to a prime ideal", etc.

It can be shown that every "finite" Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all subsets of a finite set. Therefore, the number of elements of every finite Boolean algebra is a <a href="power%20of%20two">power of two</a>.

<a href="Marshall%20H.%20Stone">Stone's</a> celebrated "<a href="Stone%27s%20representation%20theorem%20for%20Boolean%20algebras">representation theorem for Boolean algebras</a>" states that "every" Boolean algebra "A" is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all <a href="clopen%20set">clopen</a> sets in some (<a href="compact%20space">compact</a> <a href="totally%20disconnected">totally disconnected</a> <a href="Hausdorff%20space">Hausdorff</a>) topological space.

The first axiomatization of Boolean lattices/algebras in general was given by <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a> in 1898.
It included the <a href="%23Definition">above axioms</a> and additionally "x"∨1=1 and "x"∧0=0.
In 1904, the American mathematician <a href="Edward%20V.%20Huntington">Edward V. Huntington</a> (1874–1952) gave probably the most parsimonious axiomatization based on ∧, ∨, ¬, even proving the associativity laws (see box).
He also proved that these axioms are <a href="Independence%20%28mathematical%20logic%29">independent</a> of each other.
In 1933, Huntington set out the following elegant axiomatization for Boolean algebra. It requires just one binary operation + and a <a href="unary%20functional%20symbol">unary functional symbol</a> "n", to be read as 'complement', which satisfy the following laws:


<a href="Herbert%20Robbins">Herbert Robbins</a> immediately asked: If the Huntington equation is replaced with its dual, to wit:

do (1), (2), and (4) form a basis for Boolean algebra? Calling (1), (2), and (4) a "Robbins algebra", the question then becomes: Is every Robbins algebra a Boolean algebra? This question (which came to be known as the <a href="Robbins%20conjecture">Robbins conjecture</a>) remained open for decades, and became a favorite question of <a href="Alfred%20Tarski">Alfred Tarski</a> and his students. In 1996, <a href="William%20McCune">William McCune</a> at <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, building on earlier work by Larry Wos, Steve Winker, and Bob Veroff, answered Robbins's question in the affirmative: Every Robbins algebra is a Boolean algebra. Crucial to McCune's proof was the <a href="automated%20reasoning%20program">automated reasoning program</a> <a href="EQP">EQP</a> he designed. For a simplification of McCune's proof, see Dahn (1998).

Removing the requirement of existence of a unit from the axioms of Boolean algebra yields "generalized Boolean algebras". Formally, a <a href="distributive%20lattice">distributive lattice</a> "B" is a generalized Boolean lattice, if it has a smallest element 0 and for any elements "a" and "b" in "B" such that "a" ≤ "b", there exists an element "x" such that a ∧ x = 0 and a ∨ x = b. Defining a ∖ b as the unique "x" such that (a ∧ b) ∨ x = a and (a ∧ b) ∧ x = 0, we say that the structure (B,∧,∨,∖,0) is a "generalized Boolean algebra", while (B,∨,0) is a "generalized Boolean <a href="semilattice">semilattice</a>". Generalized Boolean lattices are exactly the <a href="Ideal%20%28order%20theory%29">ideals</a> of Boolean lattices.

A structure that satisfies all axioms for Boolean algebras except the two distributivity axioms is called an <a href="orthocomplemented%20lattice">orthocomplemented lattice</a>. Orthocomplemented lattices arise naturally in <a href="quantum%20logic">quantum logic</a> as lattices of closed subspaces for separable <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert space</a>s.

Bank of Italy

The Bank of Italy, known in Italian as Banca d'Italia (), also known as Bankitalia, is the <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a> of <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and part of the <a href="European%20System%20of%20Central%20Banks">European System of Central Banks</a>. It is located in <a href="Palazzo%20Koch">Palazzo Koch</a>, <a href="via%20Nazionale%20%28Rome%29">via Nazionale</a>, <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. The bank's current governor is <a href="Ignazio%20Visco">Ignazio Visco</a>, who took the office on 1 November 2011.

After the charge of monetary and exchange rate policies was shifted in 1998 to the <a href="European%20Central%20Bank">European Central Bank</a>, within the European institutional framework, the bank implements the decisions, issues <a href="euro">euro</a> banknotes and withdraws and destroys worn pieces.

The main function has thus become banking and financial supervision. The objective is to ensure the stability and efficiency of the system and compliance to rules and regulations; the bank pursues it through secondary legislation, controls and cooperation with governmental authorities.

Following reform in 2005, which was prompted by takeover scandals, the bank has lost exclusive antitrust authority in the credit sector, which is now shared with the <a href="Italian%20Competition%20Authority">Italian Competition Authority</a> ().

Other functions include, market supervision, oversight of the payment system and provision of settlement services, State treasury service, Central Credit Register, economic analysis and institutional consultancy.

Bank of Italy <a href="Official%20gold%20reserves">gold reserves</a> are 2,451.8 <a href="tonnes">tonnes</a> (2006).

The institution was established in 1893 from the combination of three major banks in Italy (after the <a href="Banca%20Romana%20scandal">Banca Romana scandal</a>). The new central bank first issued bank-notes during 1926. Until 1928, it was directed by a general manager, after this time instead by a governor elected by an internal commission of managers, with a decree from the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Italian%20Republic">President of the Italian Republic</a>, for a term of seven years.



The Bank's governing bodies are the <a href="Annual%20General%20Meeting">General Meeting of Shareholders</a>, the <a href="Board%20of%20Directors">Board of Directors</a>, the Governor, the <a href="Director%20General">Director General</a> and three Deputy Directors General; the last five constitute the Directorate. 

The general meeting takes place yearly and with the purpose of approving accounts and appointing the <a href="auditor">auditor</a>s. The Board of Directors has administrative powers and is chaired by the governor (or by the Director General in his absence). Following reform in 2005, the governor lost exclusive responsibility regarding decisions of external relevance (i.e. banking and financial supervision), which has been transferred to the Directorate (by majority vote). The Director General is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the bank, and acts as governor when absent.

The <a href="Board%20of%20Auditors">Board of Auditors</a> assesses the bank's administration and compliance with the law, regulations and the statute.

The Directorate's <a href="term%20of%20office">term of office</a> lasts six years and is renewable once. The appointment of the governor is the responsibility of the government, head of the Board of Directors, with the approval of the President of the Republic (formally a <a href="decree">decree</a> of the President). The Board of Directors is elected by the shareholders according to the bank <a href="statute">statute</a>.

On 25 October 2011, <a href="Silvio%20Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a> named <a href="Ignazio%20Visco">Ignazio Visco</a> as new governor of the bank, replacing <a href="Mario%20Draghi">Mario Draghi</a>.

Banca d'Italia had 300,000 number of shares with a nominal value of €25,000. Original scattered around the banks of whole Italy, the shares now accumulated due to the merger of the banks since 1990s. The status of the bank states that a minimum of 54% of profits would go to the Italian government, and only a maximum of 6% of profits would distributed as dividends according to shares ratio.

Beachcomber (pen name)

Beachcomber was the "<a href="pen%20name">nom de plume</a>" used by two humorous columnists, <a href="D.%20B.%20Wyndham%20Lewis">D. B. Wyndham Lewis</a> and, chiefly, <a href="J.%20B.%20Morton">J. B. Morton</a>, as authors of the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" column "By the Way" in the period 1919–1975. Two other authors have also used the name: <a href="John%20Bernard%20Arbuthnot">Major John Bernard Arbuthnot</a> <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">MVO</a>, the column's founder, and <a href="William%20Hartston">William Hartston</a>, the current author of the column in its revived form.

"By the Way" was originally a column in "<a href="The%20Globe%20%28London%29">The Globe</a>", consisting of unsigned humorous pieces; <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> was assistant editor of the column from August 1903 and editor from August 1904 to May 1909, during which time he was assisted by <a href="Herbert%20Westbrook">Herbert Westbrook</a>. After the "Globe"'s closure, it was reestablished as a society news column in the "Daily Express" from 1917 onwards, initially written by social correspondent <a href="John%20Bernard%20Arbuthnot">Major John Arbuthnot</a>, who invented the name "Beachcomber".

After Arbuthnot was promoted to deputy editor, it was taken over sometime in 1919 by Wyndham-Lewis, who reinvented it as an outlet for his wit and humour. It was then passed to Morton during 1924, though it is likely there was a period when they overlapped. Morton wrote the column until 1975; it was revived in January 1996 and continues today, written by <a href="William%20Hartston">William Hartston</a>. The column is unsigned except by "Beachcomber" and it was not publicly known that Morton or Wyndham-Lewis wrote it until the 1930s. The name is mainly associated with Morton, who has been credited as an influence by <a href="Spike%20Milligan">Spike Milligan</a> amongst others. Morton introduced the recurring characters and continuing stories that were a major feature of the column during his 51-year run.

The format of the column was a random assortment of small paragraphs which were otherwise unconnected. These could be anything, such as:


Morton's other interest, <a href="France">France</a>, was occasionally represented by epic tales of his rambling walks through the French countryside. These were not intended as humour.

"By the Way" was popular with the readership, and of course, one of the reasons it lasted so long. Its style and randomness could be off-putting, however, and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste. Oddly, one of the column's greatest opponents was the "Express" newspaper's owner, <a href="Lord%20Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a>, who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny. A prominent critic was <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, who frequently referred to him in his essays and diaries as "A Catholic Apologist" and accused him of being "silly-clever", in line with his criticisms of <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>, <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Knox">Ronald Knox</a> and Wyndham-Lewis. 

But "By the Way" was one of the few features kept continuously running in the often seriously reduced "Daily Express" throughout <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, when Morton's lampooning of <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a>, including the British invention of bracerot to make the Nazi's trousers fall down at inopportune moments, was regarded as valuable for morale.

The column appeared daily until 1965 when it was changed to weekly. It was cancelled in 1975 and revived as a daily piece in the early 1990s. It continues to the present day in much the same format, but is now entitled "Beachcomber", not "By the Way".


The <a href="Will%20Hay">Will Hay</a> film "<a href="Boys%20Will%20Be%20Boys%20%28film%29">Boys Will Be Boys</a>" (1935) was set at Morton's <a href="Narkover">Narkover</a> school.

According to Spike Milligan, the columns had been an influence on the comedic style of his radio series, "<a href="The%20Goon%20Show">The Goon Show</a>". 

In 1969, Milligan based a BBC television series named "<a href="The%20World%20of%20Beachcomber">The World of Beachcomber</a>" on the columns. A small selection was issued on a 1971 <a href="LP%20%28format%29">LP</a> and a 2-cassette set of the series' soundtrack was made available in the late 1990s.

In 1989, <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> broadcast the first of three series based on Morton's work. This featured <a href="Richard%20Ingrams">Richard Ingrams</a>, <a href="John%20Wells%20%28satirist%29">John Wells</a>, <a href="Patricia%20Routledge">Patricia Routledge</a> and <a href="John%20Sessions">John Sessions</a> playing the perennial Prodnose. The compilations prepared by <a href="Mike%20Barfield">Mike Barfield</a>. Series 1 was also made available as a 2-cassette set.

Bill Joy

William Nelson Joy (born November 8, 1954) is an American <a href="computer%20scientist">computer scientist</a>. He co-founded <a href="Sun%20Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> in 1982 along with <a href="Vinod%20Khosla">Vinod Khosla</a>, <a href="Scott%20McNealy">Scott McNealy</a> and <a href="Andreas%20von%20Bechtolsheim">Andreas von Bechtolsheim</a>, and served as chief scientist at the company until 2003. He played an integral role in the early development of <a href="BSD%20UNIX">BSD UNIX</a> while a graduate student at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">Berkeley</a>, and he is the original author of the <a href="vi">vi</a> text editor. He also wrote the 2000 essay "<a href="Why%20the%20Future%20Doesn%27t%20Need%20Us">Why the Future Doesn't Need Us</a>", in which he expressed deep concerns over the development of modern technologies.

Joy was born in the Detroit suburb of <a href="Farmington%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Farmington Hills, Michigan</a>, to William Joy, a school vice-principal and counselor, and Ruth Joy. He earned a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> in <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> and a <a href="Master%20of%20Science">Master of Science</a> in <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> and <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> in 1979. 

As a UC Berkeley graduate student, he worked for Fabry's Computer Systems Research Group <a href="CSRG">CSRG</a> on the <a href="Berkeley%20Software%20Distribution">Berkeley Software Distribution</a> (BSD) version of the <a href="Unix">Unix</a> operating system. He initially worked on a <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a> compiler left at Berkeley by <a href="Ken%20Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>, who had been visiting the University when Joy had just started his graduate work. 

He later moved on to improving the Unix <a href="Kernel%20%28computing%29">kernel</a>, and also handled BSD distributions. Some of his most notable contributions were the ex and <a href="vi">vi</a> editors and <a href="C%20shell">csh</a>. Joy's prowess as a computer programmer is legendary, with an oft-told anecdote that he wrote the <a href="vi">vi</a> editor in a weekend. Joy denies this assertion. Other of his accomplishments have also been sometimes exaggerated; <a href="Eric%20Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a>, CEO of <a href="Novell">Novell</a> at the time, inaccurately reported during an interview in <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a>'s documentary "<a href="Nerds%202.0.1">Nerds 2.0.1</a>" that Joy had personally rewritten the BSD kernel in a weekend.

According to a "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" article, during the early 1980s, <a href="DARPA">DARPA</a> had contracted the company <a href="BBN%20Technologies">Bolt, Beranek and Newman</a> (BBN) to add <a href="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> to Berkeley UNIX. Joy had been instructed to plug BBN's stack into Berkeley Unix, but he refused to do so, as he had a low opinion of BBN's TCP/IP. So, Joy wrote his own high-performance TCP/IP stack. According to <a href="John%20Gage">John Gage</a>,

BBN had a big contract to implement TCP/IP, but their stuff didn't work, and grad student Joy's stuff worked. So they had this big meeting and this grad student in a T-shirt shows up, and they said, "How did you do this?" And Bill said, "It's very simple — you read the protocol and write the code."

Rob Gurwitz, who was working at BBN at the time, disputes this version of events.

In 1982, after the firm had been going for six months, Joy was brought in with full co-founder status at <a href="Sun%20Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>. At Sun, Joy was an inspiration for the development of <a href="Network%20File%20System%20%28protocol%29">NFS</a>, the <a href="SPARC">SPARC</a> microprocessors, the <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java programming language</a>, <a href="Jini">Jini</a>/<a href="JavaSpaces">JavaSpaces</a> and <a href="JXTA">JXTA</a>.

In 1986, Joy was awarded a <a href="Grace%20Murray%20Hopper%20Award">Grace Murray Hopper Award</a> by the <a href="Association%20for%20Computing%20Machinery">ACM</a> for his work on the Berkeley UNIX Operating System. 

On September 9, 2003, Sun announced Joy was leaving the company and that he "is taking time to consider his next move and has no definite plans".

In 1999, Joy co-founded a venture capital firm, <a href="HighBAR%20Ventures">HighBAR Ventures</a>, with two Sun colleagues, Andreas von Bechtolsheim and Roy Thiele-Sardiña. In January 2005 he was named a partner in venture capital firm <a href="Kleiner%20Perkins%20Caufield%20%26amp%3B%20Byers">Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers</a>. There, Joy has made several investments in green energy industries, even though he does not have any credentials in the field. He once said, "My method is to look at something that seems like a good idea and assume it's true".

In 2011, he was inducted as a Fellow of the <a href="Computer%20History%20Museum">Computer History Museum</a> for his work on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix system and the co-founding of Sun Microsystems.

In 2000, Joy gained notoriety with the publication of his article in "<a href="Wired%20Magazine">Wired Magazine</a>", "<a href="Why%20the%20future%20doesn%27t%20need%20us">Why the future doesn't need us</a>", in which he declared, in what some have described as a "<a href="neo-Luddite">neo-Luddite</a>" position, that he was convinced that growing advances in <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> and <a href="nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a> would bring <a href="existential%20risk">risks</a> to humanity. He argued that intelligent <a href="robot">robot</a>s would replace humanity, at the very least in intellectual and social dominance, in the relatively near future. He advocates a position of relinquishment of GNR (<a href="genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, and <a href="robotics">robotics</a>) technologies, rather than going into an <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> between negative uses of the technology and defense against those negative uses (good nano-machines patrolling and defending against <a href="Grey%20Goo">Grey Goo</a> "bad" nano-machines). This stance of broad relinquishment was criticized by technologists such as <a href="technological%20singularity">technological-singularity</a> thinker <a href="Ray%20Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a>, who instead advocates fine-grained relinquishment and ethical guidelines. Joy was also criticized by the conservative "<a href="American%20Spectator">American Spectator</a>", which characterized Joy's essay as a (possibly unwitting) rationale for <a href="statism">statism</a>.

A bar-room discussion of these technologies with <a href="Ray%20Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a> started to set Joy's thinking along this path. He states in his essay that during the conversation, he became surprised that other serious scientists were considering such possibilities likely, and even more astounded at what he felt was a lack of consideration of the contingencies. After bringing the subject up with a few more acquaintances, he states that he was further alarmed by what he felt was the fact that although many people considered these futures possible or probable, that very few of them shared as serious a concern for the dangers as he seemed to. This concern led to his in-depth examination of the issue and the positions of others in the scientific community on it, and eventually, to his current activities regarding it.

Despite this, he is a <a href="venture%20capitalist">venture capitalist</a>, investing in GNR technology companies. He has also raised a specialty venture fund to address the dangers of pandemic diseases, such as the H5N1 <a href="avian%20influenza">avian influenza</a> and biological weapons.

In his 2013 book "Makers", author <a href="Chris%20Anderson%20%28writer%29">Chris Anderson</a> credited Joy with establishing "Joy's theory" based on a quip: "No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else [other than you]." His argument was that companies use an inefficient process by not hiring the best employees, only those they are able to hire. His "law" was a continuation of <a href="Friedrich%20Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a>'s ""<a href="The%20Use%20of%20Knowledge%20in%20Society">The Use of Knowledge in Society</a>"" and warned that the competition outside of a company would always have the potential to be greater than the company itself.

Bandwidth (signal processing)

Bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous set of frequencies. It is typically measured in <a href="hertz">hertz</a>, and may sometimes refer to "passband bandwidth", sometimes to "baseband bandwidth", depending on context. Passband bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower <a href="cutoff%20frequencies">cutoff frequencies</a> of, for example, a <a href="band-pass%20filter">band-pass filter</a>, a <a href="communication%20channel">communication channel</a>, or a <a href="signal%20spectrum">signal spectrum</a>. In the case of a <a href="low-pass%20filter">low-pass filter</a> or <a href="baseband%20signal">baseband signal</a>, the bandwidth is equal to its upper cutoff frequency.

Bandwidth in hertz is a central concept in many fields, including <a href="electronics">electronics</a>, <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, <a href="digital%20communication">digital communication</a>s, <a href="radio%20communication">radio communication</a>s, <a href="signal%20processing">signal processing</a>, and <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a> and is one of the determinants of the capacity of a given communication channel.

A key characteristic of bandwidth is that any band of a given width can carry the same amount of <a href="information">information</a>, regardless of where that band is located in the <a href="frequency%20spectrum">frequency spectrum</a>. For example, a 3 kHz band can carry a telephone conversation whether that band is at baseband (as in a <a href="plain%20old%20telephone%20service">POTS</a> telephone line) or <a href="modulated">modulated</a> to some higher <a href="frequency">frequency</a>.

Bandwidth is a key concept in many <a href="telecommunication">telecommunication</a>s applications. In <a href="radio">radio</a> communications, for example, bandwidth is the frequency range occupied by a modulated <a href="carrier%20signal">carrier signal</a>. An <a href="FM%20radio">FM radio</a> receiver's <a href="tuner%20%28radio%29">tuner</a> spans a limited range of frequencies. A government agency (such as the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> in the United States) may apportion the regionally available bandwidth to <a href="broadcast%20license">broadcast license</a> holders so that their <a href="signal%20%28electronics%29">signals</a> do not mutually interfere. Each transmitter owns a slice of bandwidth.

For different applications there are different precise definitions. One definition of bandwidth, for a system, could be the range of frequencies over which the system produces a specified level of performance. A less strict and more practically useful definition will refer to the frequencies beyond which frequency response is "small". Small could mean less than 3 <a href="decibel">dB</a> below the maximum value, or more rarely 10 dB below, or it could mean below a certain absolute value. As with any definition of the "width" of a function, many definitions are suitable for different purposes.

Bandwidth typically refers to baseband bandwidth in the context of, for example, the <a href="sampling%20theorem">sampling theorem</a> and <a href="Nyquist%20rate">Nyquist sampling rate</a>, while it refers to passband bandwidth in the context of <a href="Nyquist%20rate">Nyquist symbol rate</a> or <a href="Shannon-Hartley">Shannon-Hartley</a> <a href="channel%20capacity">channel capacity</a> for communication systems.

In some contexts, the signal bandwidth in <a href="hertz">hertz</a> refers to the frequency range in which the signal's <a href="spectral%20density">spectral density</a> (in W/Hz or V/Hz) is nonzero or above a small threshold value. That definition is used in calculations of the lowest sampling rate that will satisfy the <a href="sampling%20theorem">sampling theorem</a>. The threshold value is often defined relative to the maximum value, and is most commonly the , that is the point where the spectral density is half its maximum value (or the spectral amplitude, in V or V/Hz, is 70.7% of its maximum).

The word bandwidth applies to signals as described above, but it could also apply to "systems", for example <a href="Electronic%20filter">filter</a>s or <a href="communication%20channel">communication channel</a>s. To say that a system has a certain bandwidth means that the system can process signals of that bandwidth, or that the system reduces the bandwidth of a white noise input to that bandwidth.

The 3 dB bandwidth of an <a href="electronic%20filter">electronic filter</a> or communication channel is the part of the system's frequency response that lies within 3 dB of the response at its peak, which in the passband filter case is typically at or near its <a href="center%20frequency">center frequency</a>, and in the lowpass filter is near 0 hertz. If the maximum gain is 0 dB, the 3 dB bandwidth is the frequency range where the gain is more than −3 dB, or the attenuation is less than 3 dB. This is also the range of frequencies where the amplitude gain is above 70.7% of the maximum amplitude gain, and the power gain is above half the maximum power gain. This same "half power gain" convention is also used in <a href="spectral%20width">spectral width</a>, and more generally for extent of functions as <a href="full%20width%20at%20half%20maximum">full width at half maximum</a> (FWHM).

In <a href="electronic%20filter">electronic filter</a> design, a filter specification may require that within the filter <a href="passband">passband</a>, the gain is nominally 0 dB ± a small number of dB, for example within the ±1 dB interval. In the <a href="stopband">stopband</a>(s), the required attenuation in dB is above a certain level, for example >100 dB. In a <a href="transition%20band">transition band</a> the gain is not specified. In this case, the filter bandwidth corresponds to the passband width, which in this example is the 1 dB-bandwidth. If the filter shows amplitude ripple within the passband, the "x" dB point refers to the point where the gain is "x" dB below the nominal passband gain rather than "x" dB below the maximum gain.

A commonly used quantity is fractional bandwidth. This is the bandwidth of a device divided by its center frequency. E.g., a passband filter that has a bandwidth of 2 MHz with center frequency 10 MHz will have a fractional bandwidth of 2/10, or 20%.

In communication systems, in calculations of the <a href="Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley">Shannon–Hartley</a> <a href="channel%20capacity">channel capacity</a>, bandwidth refers to the 3 dB-bandwidth. In calculations of the maximum <a href="symbol%20rate">symbol rate</a>, the <a href="Nyquist%20sampling%20rate">Nyquist sampling rate</a>, and maximum bit rate according to the <a href="Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley%23Hartley%27s%20law">Hartley formula</a>, the bandwidth refers to the frequency range within which the gain is non-zero, or the gain in dB is below a very large value.

The fact that in equivalent <a href="baseband">baseband</a> models of communication systems, the signal spectrum consists of both negative and positive frequencies, can lead to confusion about bandwidth, since they are sometimes referred to only by the positive half, and one will occasionally see expressions such as formula_1, where formula_2 is the total bandwidth (i.e. the maximum passband bandwidth of the carrier-modulated RF signal and the minimum passband bandwidth of the physical passband channel), and formula_3 is the positive bandwidth (the baseband bandwidth of the equivalent channel model). For instance, the baseband model of the signal would require a <a href="lowpass%20filter">lowpass filter</a> with cutoff frequency of at least formula_3 to stay intact, and the physical passband channel would require a passband filter of at least formula_2 to stay intact.

In signal processing and <a href="control%20theory">control theory</a> the bandwidth is the frequency at which the <a href="Closed-loop%20transfer%20function">closed-loop system gain</a> drops 3 dB below peak.

In basic electric circuit theory, when studying band-pass and band-reject filters, the bandwidth represents the distance between the two points in the <a href="frequency%20domain">frequency domain</a> where the signal is formula_6 of the maximum signal amplitude (half power).

In the field of <a href="Antenna%20%28radio%29">antennas</a>, two different methods of expressing relative bandwidth are used for <a href="narrowband">narrowband</a> and <a href="wideband">wideband</a> antennas. For either, a set of criteria is established to define the extents of the bandwidth, such as <a href="input%20impedance">input impedance</a>, <a href="pattern">pattern</a>, or <a href="Polarization%20%28antenna%29">polarization</a>.

"Percent bandwidth", usually used for <a href="narrowband">narrowband</a> antennas, is used defined as formula_7. The theoretical limit to percent bandwidth is 200%, which occurs for formula_8.

"Fractional bandwidth or Ratio bandwidth", usually used for <a href="wideband">wideband</a> antennas, is defined as formula_9 and is typically presented in the form of formula_10. Fractional bandwidth is used for wideband antennas because of the compression of the percent bandwidth that occurs mathematically with percent bandwidths above 100%, which corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 3:1.

If formula_11

then formula_12.

In <a href="photonics">photonics</a>, the term "bandwidth" occurs in a variety of meanings:

A related concept is the <a href="spectral%20linewidth">spectral linewidth</a> of the radiation emitted by excited atoms.

Bodhisattva

In <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, Bodhisattva is the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated <a href="Bodhicitta">Bodhicitta</a>, which is a spontaneous wish and a compassionate mind to attain <a href="Buddhahood">Buddhahood</a> for the benefit of all <a href="Sentient%20beings%20%28Buddhism%29">sentient beings</a>. Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in <a href="Buddhist%20art">Buddhist art</a>.

In early Indian Buddhism, the term "bodhisattva" was primarily used to refer specifically to <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> in his former life. The <a href="Jataka%20tales">Jataka tales</a>, which are the stories of the Buddha's past lives, depict the various attempts of the bodhisattva to embrace qualities like self-sacrifice and morality.

According to the Jataka tales, the term "bodhisattva" originally referred to the pre-enlightened practitioner of austerities that surpassed <a href="%C5%9Ar%C4%81vakay%C4%81na">Śrāvakayana</a> and <a href="Pratyekabuddhayana">Pratyekabuddhayana</a> by far and completed <a href="Bodhisattvayana">Bodhisattvayana</a>. <a href="Mount%20Potalaka">Mount Potalaka</a>, for example, is one of Bodhisattvayana. The term for practitioners who have not yet reached Bodhisattvayana was not fixed, but the terms "Śrāvaka-Bodhisattva" (聲聞菩薩) and "Pratyekabuddha-Bodhisattva" (縁覚菩薩) had already appeared in the <a href="%C4%80gama%20%28Buddhism%29">Āgama</a> scriptures of early Indian Buddhism.

<a href="Mahayana%20Buddhism">Mahayana Buddhism</a> did not place much emphasis in honoring Śrāvakayana and Pratyekabuddhayana since they were classified as part of the <a href="Hinayana">Hinayana</a>, but praise of the general Bodhisattvayana was commonplace. Because Hinayana was disliked and the terms Śrāvaka-Bodhisattva or Pratyekabuddha-Bodhisattva were not widely used, while usage of the general term "bodhisattva" had grown in popularity. Nevertheless, "bodhisattva" retained an implied reference to someone on the path to become an <a href="arhat">arhat</a> or <a href="pratyekabuddha">pratyekabuddha</a>. In contrast, the goal of Mahayana's bodhisattva path is to achieve "Samyaksambodhiṃ." 

In <a href="Theravada">Theravada Buddhism</a>, the equivalent <a href="Pali">Pali</a> term "bodhisatta" is used in the <a href="P%C4%81li%20Canon">Pāli Canon</a> to refer to Gautama Buddha in his previous lives and as a young man in his current life in the period during which he was working towards his own <a href="moksha">liberation</a>. During his discourses, to recount his experiences as a young aspirant he regularly uses the phrase "When I was an unenlightened bodhisatta..." The term therefore connotes a being who is "bound for enlightenment", in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the Pāli canon, the bodhisatta is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are featured in the Jataka tales.

According to the Theravāda monk <a href="Bhikkhu%20Bodhi">Bhikkhu Bodhi</a>, the bodhisattva path is not taught in the earliest strata of Buddhist texts such as the Pali <a href="Nikayas">Nikayas</a> (and their counterparts such as the Chinese <a href="%C4%80gama%20%28Buddhism%29">Āgamas</a>) which instead focus on the ideal of the <a href="Arahant">Arahant</a>. In later <a href="Theravada%23Scriptures">Theravada literature</a>, the term "bodhisatta" is used fairly frequently in the sense of someone on the path to liberation. The later tradition of commentary also recognizes two additional types of bodhisattas: the "paccekabodhisatta", who will attain <a href="Pratyekabuddha">Paccekabuddhahood</a>, and the "savakabodhisatta", who will attain enlightenment as a disciple of a Buddha. In the 1st-2nd century BCE Sri Lankan work, the <a href="Buddhavamsa">Buddhavamsa</a>, the idea of the person who makes a Bodhisatta vow to become a fully enlightened Buddha out of compassion for all sentient beings is presented. Another related concept outlined in the Buddhavamsa and in another text called the <a href="Cariyapitaka">Cariyapitaka</a> is the need to cultivate certain Bodhisatta perfections or <a href="paramitas">paramitas</a>

Kings of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> were often described as bodhisattvas, starting at least as early as Sirisanghabodhi (r. 247-249), who was renowned for his compassion, took vows for the welfare of the citizens, and was regarded as a <a href="Mah%C4%81sattva">mahāsatta</a> (Sanskrit "mahāsattva"), an epithet used almost exclusively in Mahayana Buddhism. Many other Sri Lankan kings from the 3rd until the 15th century were also described as bodhisattvas and their royal duties were sometimes clearly associated with the practice of the Ten Pāramitās.

Theravadin <a href="bhikkhu">bhikkhu</a> and scholar <a href="Walpola%20Rahula">Walpola Rahula</a> stated that the bodhisattva ideal has traditionally been held to be higher than the state of a "śrāvaka" not only in Mahayana but also in Theravada Buddhism. He also quotes the 10th century king of Sri Lanka, <a href="List%20of%20Sri%20Lankan%20monarchs%23House%20of%20Lambakanna%20II%20.28691.E2.80.931017.29">Mahinda IV</a> (956-972 CE), who had the words inscribed "none but the bodhisattvas will become kings of a prosperous Lanka," among other examples.
Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas.

According to Jeffrey Samuels, it "may more accurately portray the differences that exist between the two yanas by referring to Mahayana Buddhism as a vehicle in which the bodhisattva ideal is more universally applied, and to Theravada Buddhism as a vehicle in which the bodhisattva ideal is reserved for and appropriated by certain exceptional people."

<a href="Mahayana">Mahāyāna</a> Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva.
According to Jan Nattier, the term "Mahāyāna" ("Great Vehicle") was originally even an honorary synonym for "Bodhisattvayāna", or the "Bodhisattva Vehicle." The "" contains a simple and brief definition for the term "bodhisattva", which is also the earliest known Mahāyāna definition. This definition is given as the following.

The earliest depiction of the Bodhisattva path in texts such as the <a href="Ugraparip%E1%B9%9Bcch%C4%81%20S%C5%ABtra">Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra</a> describe it as an arduous, difficult monastic path suited only for the few which is nevertheless the most glorious path one can take. Three kinds of Bodhisattvas are mentioned in the early Mahayana texts: the forest, city, and monastery Bodhisattvas - with forest dwelling being promoted a superior, even necessary path in sutras such as the Ugraparipṛcchā and the <a href="Samadhiraja%20Sutra">Samadhiraja</a> sutras. The early Rastrapalapariprccha sutra also promotes a solitary life of meditation in the forests, far away from the distractions of the householder life. The Rastrapala is also highly critical of monks living in monasteries and in cities who are seen as not practicing meditation and morality. The Ratnagunasamcayagatha also says the Bodhisattva should undertake ascetic practices (<a href="dhutanga">dhutanga</a>), "wander freely without a home", practice the <a href="paramitas">paramitas</a> and train under a guru in order to perfect his meditation practice and realization of <a href="prajnaparamita">prajnaparamita</a>. These texts seem to indicate the initial Bodhisattva ideal was associated with a strict forest <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a>.

Mahāyāna Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas and to take the <a href="bodhisattva%20vows">bodhisattva vows</a>. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all <a href="Sentient%20beings%20%28Buddhism%29">sentient beings</a> by practicing the six perfections. Indelibly entwined with the bodhisattva vow is <a href="parinamana">merit transference</a> ("pariṇāmanā").

In Mahāyāna, life in this world is compared to people living in a house that is on fire. People take this world as reality pursuing worldly projects and pleasures without realizing that the house is ablaze and will soon burn down (due to the inevitability of death). A bodhisattva is one who has a determination to free sentient beings from <a href="samsara">samsara</a> and its cycle of death, rebirth and suffering. This type of mind is known as the <a href="bodhicitta">mind of awakening</a> ("bodhicitta"). Bodhisattvas take bodhisattva vows in order to progress on the spiritual path towards <a href="buddhahood">buddhahood</a>.

There are a variety of different conceptions of the nature of a bodhisattva in Mahāyāna. According to some sources a bodhisattva is someone on the path to full Buddhahood. Others speak of bodhisattvas renouncing Buddhahood. According to the "Kun-bzang bla-ma'i zhal-lung", a bodhisattva can choose any of three paths in their aspiration to help sentient beings in the process of achieving buddhahood. They are:

According to the doctrine of some Tibetan schools (like Theravāda but for different reasons), only the first of these is recognized. It is held that Buddhas remain in the world, able to help others, so there is no point in delay. <a href="Kelsang%20Gyatso">Geshe Kelsang Gyatso</a> notes:

In reality, the second two types of bodhicitta are wishes that are impossible to fulfill because it is only possible to lead others to enlightenment once we have attained enlightenment ourself. Therefore, only king-like bodhicitta is actual bodhicitta. Je Tsongkhapa says that although the other Bodhisattvas wish for that which is impossible, their attitude is sublime and unmistaken.
The <a href="Nyingma">Nyingma</a> school, however, holds that the lowest level is the way of the king, who primarily seeks his own benefit but who recognizes that his benefit depends crucially on that of his kingdom and his subjects. The middle level is the path of the boatman, who ferries his passengers across the river and simultaneously, of course, ferries himself as well. The highest level is that of the shepherd, who makes sure that all his sheep arrive safely ahead of him and places their welfare above his.

According to many traditions within Mahāyāna Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or "<a href="Bhumi%20%28Buddhism%29">bhūmis</a>." Below is the list of the ten "bhūmis" and their descriptions according to the "<a href="Avatamsaka%20Sutra">Avataṃsaka Sūtra</a>" and "The Jewel Ornament of Liberation," a treatise by <a href="Gampopa">Gampopa</a>, an influential teacher of the <a href="Tibetan%20Buddhism">Tibetan</a> <a href="Kagyu">Kagyu</a> school. (Other schools give slightly variant descriptions.)

Before a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of five paths:

The ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths

The chapter of ten grounds in the "Avataṃsaka Sūtra" refers to 52 stages. The 10 grounds are:


After the ten "bhūmis", according to Mahāyāna Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment and becomes a Buddha.

With the 52 stages, the "<a href="Shurangama%20Sutra">Śūraṅgama Sūtra</a>" recognizes 57 stages. With the 10 grounds, various <a href="Vajrayana">Vajrayāna</a> schools recognize 3–10 additional grounds, mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions.

A bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a "<a href="mah%C4%81sattva">mahāsattva</a>". Some bodhisattvas such as <a href="Samantabhadra">Samantabhadra</a> are also said to have already attained buddhahood.

Some sutras said a beginner would take 3–22 countless eons ("<a href="asa%E1%B9%83khyeya">mahāsaṃkhyeya</a> <a href="Kalpa%20%28aeon%29">kalpas</a>") to become a buddha. <a href="Pure%20Land%20Buddhism">Pure Land Buddhism</a> suggests buddhists go to the <a href="pure%20land">pure land</a>s to practice as bodhisattvas. <a href="Tiantai">Tiantai</a>, <a href="Huayan%20school">Huayan</a>, <a href="Zen">Zen</a> and <a href="Vajrayana">Vajrayāna</a> schools say they teach ways to attain buddhahood within one karmic cycle.

Various traditions within Buddhism believe in specific bodhisattvas. Some bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen as separate entities. For example, <a href="Tibetan%20Buddhism">Tibetan Buddhists</a> believe in various forms of <a href="Chenrezig">Chenrezig</a>, who is <a href="Avalokitesvara">Avalokiteśvara</a> in Sanskrit, <a href="Guanyin">Guanyin</a> in China, Gwan-eum in Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and <a href="Kannon">Kannon</a> in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the <a href="Dalai%20Lama">Dalai Lama</a>s and the <a href="Karmapa">Karmapa</a>s to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.

<a href="Ksitigarbha">Kṣitigarbha</a> is another popular bodhisattva in Japan and China. He is known for aiding those who are lost. His greatest compassionate vow is:

The place of a bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of <a href="enlightenment%20%28Buddhism%29">enlightenment</a> or the acts of <a href="Dharma">Dharma</a>, is known as a "<a href="bodhima%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Da">bodhimaṇḍa</a>", and may be a site of <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>. Many temples and monasteries are famous as bodhimaṇḍas. Perhaps the most famous bodhimaṇḍa of all is the <a href="Bodhi%20Tree">Bodhi Tree</a> under which <a href="Shakyamuni">Śākyamuṇi</a> achieved buddhahood. In the tradition of <a href="Chinese%20Buddhism">Chinese Buddhism</a>, there are four mountains that are regarded as bodhimaṇḍas for bodhisattvas, with each site having major monasteries and being popular for pilgrimages by both monastics and laypeople. These four bodhimandas are:

Buckingham Palace

Buckingham Palace () is the <a href="London">London</a> residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning <a href="monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">monarch of the United Kingdom</a>. Located in the <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">City of Westminster</a>, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the <a href="British%20people">British people</a> at times of national rejoicing and mourning.

Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large <a href="townhouse">townhouse</a> built for the <a href="John%20Sheffield%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Normanby">Duke of Buckingham</a> in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> in 1761 as a private residence for <a href="Charlotte%20of%20Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Queen Charlotte</a> and became known as "The Queen's House". During the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects <a href="John%20Nash%20%28architect%29">John Nash</a> and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> in 1837.

The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds. The palace chapel was destroyed by a German bomb during World War II; the <a href="Queen%27s%20Gallery">Queen's Gallery</a> was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the <a href="Royal%20Collection">Royal Collection</a>.

The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured <a href="scagliola">scagliola</a> and blue and pink <a href="Lapis%20lazuli">lapis</a>, on the advice of Sir Charles Long. <a href="Edward%20VII">King Edward VII</a> oversaw a partial redecoration in a "<a href="Belle%20%C3%89poque">Belle Époque</a>" cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese <a href="Chinoiserie">regency</a> style with furniture and fittings brought from the <a href="Royal%20Pavilion">Royal Pavilion</a> at <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> and from <a href="Carlton%20House%2C%20London">Carlton House</a>. The palace has 775 rooms, and <a href="Buckingham%20Palace%20Garden">the garden</a> is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the site of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river <a href="Tyburn%20%28stream%29">Tyburn</a>, which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace. Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> and his <a href="queen%20consort">queen consort</a> <a href="Edith%20of%20Wessex">Edith of Wessex</a> in late Saxon times, and, after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>, <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>. William gave the site to <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Mandeville%20%2811th%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bcentury%29">Geoffrey de Mandeville</a>, who bequeathed it to the monks of <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

In 1531, <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a> acquired the Hospital of St James (later <a href="St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJames%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>) from <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey. These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.

Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the <a href="Freehold%20%28law%29">freehold</a> was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland. Needing money, <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James I</a> sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) <a href="Clement%20Walker">Clement Walker</a> in "Anarchia Anglicana" (1649) refers to "new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir <a href="Hugh%20Audley">Hugh Audley</a> by the great heiress Mary Davies.

Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake, around 1624. The next owner was <a href="George%20Goring%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Norwich">Lord Goring</a>, who from 1633 extended Blake's house and developed much of today's garden, then known as Goring Great Garden. He did not, however, obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden. Unbeknown to Goring, in 1640 the document "failed to pass the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Great Seal</a> before <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles I</a> fled London, which it needed to do for legal execution". It was this critical omission that helped the British royal family regain the freehold under <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>.

The improvident Goring defaulted on his rents; <a href="Henry%20Bennet%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Arlington">Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington</a> obtained the mansion and was occupying it, now known as Goring House, when it burned down in 1674. Arlington House rose on the site—the location of the southern wing of today's palace—the next year. In 1698, <a href="John%20Sheffield%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Normanby">John Sheffield</a>, later the first <a href="Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Normanby">Duke of Buckingham and Normanby</a>, acquired the lease.

The house which forms the architectural core of the palace was built for the first <a href="John%20Sheffield%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Normanby">Duke of Buckingham and Normanby</a> in 1703 to the design of <a href="William%20Winde">William Winde</a>. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings. Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham's natural son, <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Herbert%20Sheffield%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Charles Sheffield</a>, in 1761 to <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> for <a href="Pound%20%28currency%29">£</a>21,000. Sheffield's <a href="leasehold">leasehold</a> on the mulberry garden site, the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family, was due to expire in 1774.

Under the new crown ownership, the building was originally intended as a private retreat for King George III's wife, <a href="Charlotte%20of%20Mecklenburg-Strelitz">Queen Charlotte</a>, and was accordingly known as The Queen's House. Remodelling of the structure began in 1762. In 1775, an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte, in exchange for her rights to <a href="Somerset%20House">Somerset House</a>, and 14 of their 15 children were born there. Some furnishings were transferred from <a href="Carlton%20House%2C%20London">Carlton House</a>, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution of 1789. While <a href="St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJames%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a> remained the official and ceremonial royal residence, the name "Buckingham-palace" began from at least 1791.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George IV</a> continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect <a href="John%20Nash%20%28architect%29">John Nash</a>. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King William IV</a> hired <a href="Edward%20Blore">Edward Blore</a> to finish the work. After the destruction of the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.

Buckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, who was the first monarch to reside there; her predecessor William IV had died before its completion. While the <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the <a href="Royal%20Household">household</a> offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.

By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family, and consequently the new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by <a href="Thomas%20Cubitt">Thomas Cubitt</a>, enclosing the central quadrangle. The large East Front, facing <a href="The%20Mall%2C%20London">The Mall</a>, is today the "public face" of Buckingham Palace, and contains the balcony from which the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">royal family</a> acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual <a href="Trooping%20the%20Colour">Trooping the Colour</a>. The <a href="ballroom">ballroom</a> wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student <a href="James%20Pennethorne">Sir James Pennethorne</a>.

Before Prince Albert's death, the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments, and the greatest contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace. The composer <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a> is known to have played there on three occasions. <a href="Johann%20Strauss%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Johann Strauss II</a> and his orchestra played there when in England. Strauss's "Alice Polka" was first performed at the palace in 1849 in honour of the queen's daughter, <a href="Princess%20Alice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Princess Alice</a>. Under Victoria, Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the usual royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations.

Widowed in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a> and <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a>. For many years the palace was seldom used, even neglected. In 1864, a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace, saying: "These commanding premises to be let or sold, in consequence of the late occupant's declining business." Eventually, public opinion persuaded the Queen to return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black, while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year.

The palace measures by , is high and contains over of floorspace. The floor area is <a href="World%27s%20largest%20palace">smaller than</a> the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Madrid">Royal Palace of Madrid</a>, the <a href="Apostolic%20Palace">Papal Palace</a> and <a href="Quirinal%20Palace">Quirinal Palace</a> in Rome, the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> in Paris, the <a href="Hofburg%20Palace">Hofburg Palace</a> in Vienna, and the <a href="Forbidden%20City">Forbidden City</a>. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The palace also has its own post office, cinema, swimming pool, doctor's surgery, and jeweller's workshop.

The principal rooms are contained on the "<a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a>" behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>, <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">van Dyck</a>, <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a> and <a href="Johannes%20Vermeer">Vermeer</a>; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the <a href="Throne%20room">Throne Room</a> and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a <a href="Tribune%20%28architecture%29">tribune</a> lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.
Directly underneath the <a href="State%20room">State Apartments</a> is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private <a href="Head%20of%20state">audiences</a>. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the "1844 Room", decorated in that year for the State visit of <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Nicholas%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I of Russia</a>, and, on the other side of the Bow Room, the "1855 Room", in honour of the visit of Emperor <a href="Napoleon%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII%20of%20France">Napoleon III of France</a>. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's <a href="Garden%20party">Garden Parties</a> in the Gardens. The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.

Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the <a href="Royal%20Pavilion">Brighton Pavilion</a> was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by <a href="Richard%20Westmacott">Richard Westmacott</a>. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding <a href="Mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarins</a> in <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niches</a> and fearsome winged <a href="Chinese%20dragon">dragons</a>, designed by Robert Jones.

At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer <a href="Charles%20Allom">Sir Charles Allom</a>, created a more "binding" Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the <a href="lacquer">lacquer</a> doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the "piano nobile" of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle. It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a> pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.

The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured <a href="scagliola">scagliola</a> and blue and pink <a href="Lapis%20lazuli">lapis</a>, on the advice of Sir Charles Long. <a href="Edward%20VII">King Edward VII</a> oversaw a partial redecoration in a <a href="Belle%20%C3%89poque">Belle époque</a> cream and gold colour scheme.

When paying a state visit to Britain, foreign <a href="Head%20of%20state">heads of state</a> are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are allocated a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated at the foot of the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one of them is given extra height and perspective by <a href="Dome">saucer domes</a> designed by Nash in the style of Soane. A second corridor in the suite has Gothic-influenced <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">cross-over vaulting</a>. The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle <a href="Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium">Léopold I</a>, first King of the Belgians. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by <a href="Edward%20VIII">King Edward VIII</a>.

<a href="Investiture">Investiture</a>s, which include the conferring of <a href="knight">knight</a>hoods by dubbing with a sword, and other awards take place in the palace's Ballroom, built in 1854. At long, wide and high, it is the largest room in the palace. It has replaced the throne room in importance and use. During investitures, the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant, domed velvet canopy, known as a shamiana or a <a href="baldachin">baldachin</a>, that was used at the <a href="Delhi%20Durbar">Delhi Durbar</a> in 1911. A military band plays in the musicians' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their <a href="honour">honour</a>s, watched by their families and friends.

State <a href="banquet">banquet</a>s also take place in the Ballroom; these formal dinners are held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state. On these occasions, for up to 170 guests in formal "white tie and decorations", including tiaras, the dining table is laid with the Grand Service, a collection of silver-gilt plate made in 1811 for the Prince of Wales, later George IV. The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November when the Queen entertains members of the <a href="diplomatic%20corps">diplomatic corps</a>. On this grand occasion, all the state rooms are in use, as the royal family proceed through them, beginning at the great north doors of the Picture Gallery. As Nash had envisaged, all the large, double-mirrored doors stand open, reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces, creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.

Smaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the "1844 Room". Here too, the Queen holds small lunch parties, and often meetings of the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>. Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and domed Music Room, or the State Dining Room. Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War II, royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room. The Queen's first three children were all baptised there. On all formal occasions, the ceremonies are attended by the <a href="Yeomen%20of%20the%20Guard">Yeomen of the Guard</a> in their historic uniforms, and other officers of the court such as the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>.

Formerly, men not wearing <a href="military%20uniform">military uniform</a> wore knee <a href="breeches">breeches</a> of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and <a href="tiara">tiara</a>s or feathers in their hair (or both). The dress code governing formal <a href="Court%20uniform%20and%20dress%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">court uniform and dress</a> has progressively relaxed. After <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a>, when <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a> and his consort, <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth</a>, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear <a href="Uniform">service uniform</a> or <a href="lounge%20suit">lounge suit</a>s; a minority wear <a href="Tailcoat">morning coats</a>, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, <a href="black%20tie">black tie</a> or <a href="white%20tie">white tie</a>.

<a href="Debutante">Débutantes</a> were aristocratic young ladies making their first entrée into society through presentation to the monarch at court. These occasions, known as "coming out", took place at the palace from the reign of Edward VII. Wearing full court dress, with three ostrich feathers in their hair, débutantes entered, curtsied, and performed a backwards walk and a further curtsey, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. The ceremony, known as an evening court, corresponded to the "<a href="Drawing%20room">court drawing rooms</a>" of Victoria's reign. After World War II, the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions, usually omitting curtsies and court dress. In 1958, the Queen abolished the presentation parties for débutantes, replacing them with Garden Parties, for up to 8,000 invitees in <a href="Buckingham%20Palace%20Garden">the Garden</a>. They are the largest functions of the year.

<a href="The%20boy%20Jones">The boy Jones</a> was an intruder who gained entry to the palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including <a href="Michael%20Fagan%20incident">Michael Fagan</a>, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media reported that he had a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", Fagan said the Queen ran out of the room and no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a criminal offence.

At the rear of the palace is the large and park-like garden, which together with its lake is the largest private garden in London. There, the Queen hosts her annual garden parties each summer, and also holds large functions to celebrate royal milestones, such as jubilees. It covers , and includes a helicopter landing area, a lake, and a tennis court.

Adjacent to the palace is the <a href="Royal%20Mews">Royal Mews</a>, also designed by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the <a href="Gold%20State%20Coach">Gold State Coach</a>, are housed. This <a href="rococo">rococo</a> gilt coach, designed by <a href="Sir%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BWilliam%20Chambers">Sir William Chambers</a> in 1760, has painted panels by <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Cipriani">G. B. Cipriani</a>. It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by George III in 1762 and has been used by the monarch for every coronation since George IV. It was last used for the <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II</a>. Also housed in the mews are the coach horses used at royal ceremonial processions.

<a href="The%20Mall%2C%20London">The Mall</a>, a ceremonial approach route to the palace, was designed by Sir Aston Webb and completed in 1911 as part of a grand memorial to <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. It extends from <a href="Admiralty%20Arch">Admiralty Arch</a>, across <a href="St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJames%27s%20Park">St James's Park</a> to the <a href="Victoria%20Memorial%20%28London%29">Victoria Memorial</a>. This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state, and by the royal family on state occasions such as the annual Trooping the Colour.

In 1901 the accession of <a href="Edward%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII">Edward VII</a> saw new life breathed into the palace. The new King and his wife <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Queen Alexandra</a> had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as "the <a href="Marlborough%20House">Marlborough House</a> Set", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle époque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel King Edward's heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash's original work.

The last major building work took place during the reign of <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part <a href="Giacomo%20Leoni">Giacomo Leoni</a>'s <a href="Lyme%20Park">Lyme Park</a> in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>) was designed to be the backdrop to the <a href="Victoria%20Memorial%20%28London%29">Victoria Memorial</a>, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">command performances</a> featuring <a href="jazz">jazz</a> musicians such as the <a href="Original%20Dixieland%20Jazz%20Band">Original Dixieland Jazz Band</a> (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, <a href="Sidney%20Bechet">Sidney Bechet</a>, and <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a <a href="Brecon%20Jazz%20Festival%23%28Kind%20of%29%20Blue%20Plaque">(Kind of) Blue Plaque</a> by the <a href="Brecon%20Jazz%20Festival">Brecon Jazz Festival</a> as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> was a <a href="connoisseur">connoisseur</a> of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble <a href="Empire%20style">Empire-style</a> chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.
During World War I, the palace, then the home of King George V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained "in situ". The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and household. To the King's later regret, <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.

During World War II, the palace was bombed nine times, the most serious and publicised of which resulted in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed. War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: "I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End</a> in the face". The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as "<a href="Sunday%20Graphic">The Sunday Graphic</a>" reported:

On 15 September 1940, known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20Day">Battle of Britain Day</a>, an RAF pilot, <a href="Ray%20Holmes">Ray Holmes</a> of <a href="No.%20504%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 504 Squadron RAF</a> rammed a German bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the <a href="Dornier%20Do%2017">Dornier Do 17</a> bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, <a href="Feldwebel">Feldwebel</a> Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of <a href="London%20Victoria%20station">London Victoria station</a>. The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum">Imperial War Museum</a> in London. The British pilot became a <a href="Queen%27s%20Messenger">King's Messenger</a> after the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005.

On <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">VE Day</a>—8 May 1945—the palace was the centre of British celebrations. The King, Queen, Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen), and <a href="Princess%20Margaret%2C%20Countess%20of%20Snowdon">Princess Margaret</a> appeared on the balcony, with the palace's blacked-out windows behind them, to the cheers from a vast crowd in <a href="The%20Mall%2C%20London">the Mall</a>. The damaged Palace was carefully restored after the War by <a href="Mowlem">John Mowlem & Co.</a> It was designated a Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 1970.

Every year, some 50,000 invited guests are entertained at garden parties, receptions, audiences, and banquets. Three <a href="Garden%20party">Garden Parties</a> are held in the summer, usually in July. The Forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for <a href="Changing%20the%20Queen%27s%20Life%20Guard">Changing of the Guard</a>, a major ceremony and tourist attraction (daily from April to July; every other day in other months).

The palace, like Windsor Castle, is owned by the reigning monarch in right of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>. It is not the monarch's personal property, unlike <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham House</a> and <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>. Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a>, and St James's Palace are part of the Royal Collection, held in trust by the Sovereign; they can, on occasion, be viewed by the public at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Gallery">Queen's Gallery</a>, near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an <a href="airstrike">air raid</a> in World War II. The palace's <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s have been open to the public during August and September and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the <a href="1992%20Windsor%20Castle%20fire">1992 fire</a> devastated many of its state rooms. In the year to 31 March 2016, 519,000 people visited the palace, and 194,000 visited the gallery.

<a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Government">Her Majesty's Government</a> is responsible for maintaining the palace in exchange for the profits made by the <a href="Crown%20Estate">Crown Estate</a>. In November 2015, the State Dining Room was closed for six months because its ceiling had become potentially dangerous. A 10-year schedule of maintenance work, including new plumbing, wiring, boilers, and radiators, and the installation of <a href="solar%20panels">solar panels</a> on the roof, has been estimated to cost £369 million and was approved by the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">prime minister</a> in November 2016. It will be funded by a temporary increase in the <a href="Sovereign%20Grant">Sovereign Grant</a> paid from the income of the Crown Estate and is intended to extend the building's working life by at least 50 years.

British Airways

British Airways (BA) is the largest airline in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> based on fleet size, or the second largest, behind <a href="easyJet">easyJet</a>, when measured by passengers carried. The airline is based in <a href="Waterside%20%28building%29">Waterside</a> near its main <a href="Airline%20hub">hub</a> at <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a>. In January 2011 BA merged with <a href="Iberia%20%28airline%29">Iberia</a>, creating the <a href="International%20Airlines%20Group">International Airlines Group</a> (IAG), a <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a> registered in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, Spain. IAG is the world's third-largest airline group in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest in Europe. It is listed on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> and in the <a href="FTSE%20100%20Index">FTSE 100 Index</a>.

BA was created in 1974 after a British Airways Board was established by the British government to manage the two nationalised airline corporations, <a href="British%20Overseas%20Airways%20Corporation">British Overseas Airways Corporation</a> and <a href="British%20European%20Airways">British European Airways</a>, and two regional airlines, <a href="Cambrian%20Airways">Cambrian Airways</a> from <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, and <a href="Northeast%20Airlines%20%28UK%29">Northeast Airlines</a> from <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. On 31 March 1974, all four companies were merged to form British Airways. After almost 13 years as a state company, BA was privatised in February 1987 as part of a wider privatisation plan by the <a href="Second%20Thatcher%20ministry">Conservative government</a>. The carrier expanded with the acquisition of <a href="British%20Caledonian">British Caledonian</a> in 1987, <a href="Dan-Air">Dan-Air</a> in 1992, and <a href="British%20Midland%20International">British Midland International</a> in 2012.

A long-time <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> customer, BA ordered 59 <a href="Airbus%20A320%20family">Airbus A320 family</a> aircraft in August 1998. In 2007 it purchased 12 <a href="Airbus%20A380">Airbus A380</a>s and 24 <a href="Boeing%20787%20Dreamliner">Boeing 787 Dreamliner</a>s, marking the start of its <a href="flight%20length">long-haul</a> fleet replacement. The centrepiece of the airline's long-haul fleet is the <a href="Boeing%20777">Boeing 777</a>, with 58 in the fleet. BA is the largest operator of the <a href="Boeing%20747-400">Boeing 747-400</a>, with 41 registered to the airline. It is a founding member of the <a href="Oneworld">Oneworld</a> airline alliance, along with <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a>, <a href="Cathay%20Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a>, <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a>, and the now defunct <a href="Canadian%20Airlines">Canadian Airlines</a>. The alliance has since grown to become the third largest, after <a href="SkyTeam">SkyTeam</a> and <a href="Star%20Alliance">Star Alliance</a>.

Proposals to establish a joint British airline, combining the assets of the <a href="British%20Overseas%20Airways%20Corporation">British Overseas Airways Corporation</a> (BOAC) and <a href="British%20European%20Airways">British European Airways</a> (BEA) were first raised in 1953 as a result of difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary <a href="Cyprus%20Airways">Cyprus Airways</a> to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> at the time, <a href="Rab%20Butler">Rab Butler</a>. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.

Consequently, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report that a new British Airways Board, managing both BEA and BOAC, and the two regional British airlines <a href="Cambrian%20Airways">Cambrian Airways</a> based at Cardiff, and <a href="Northeast%20Airlines">Northeast Airlines</a> based at Newcastle upon Tyne, was constituted on 1 April 1972. Although each airline's individual branding was maintained initially, two years later the British Airways Board unified its branding, effectively establishing British Airways as an airline on 31 March 1974. 

Following two years of fierce competition with <a href="British%20Caledonian">British Caledonian</a>, the second-largest airline in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers would no longer compete on long-haul routes.

British Airways and <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a> operated the <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> airliner <a href="Concorde">Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde</a>, and the world's first <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> passenger service flew in January 1976 from <a href="London%20Heathrow">London Heathrow</a> to <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>. Services to the US began on 24 May 1976 with a flight to <a href="Washington%20Dulles%20International%20Airport">Washington Dulles</a> airport, and flights to <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">New York JFK</a> airport followed on 22 September 1977. Service to Singapore was established in co-operation with <a href="Singapore%20Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> as a continuation of the flight to Bahrain. Following the <a href="Air%20France%20Flight%204590">Air France Concorde crash</a> in Paris and a slump in air travel following the <a href="11%20September%20attacks">11 September attacks</a> in New York in 2001, it was decided to cease Concorde operations in 2003 after 27 years of service. The final commercial Concorde flight was BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 24 October 2003.
In 1981 the airline was instructed to prepare for privatisation by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> <a href="Second%20Thatcher%20ministry">Thatcher</a> government. <a href="John%20King%2C%20Baron%20King%20of%20Wartnaby">Sir John King</a>, later Lord King, was appointed chairman, charged with bringing the airline back into profitability. While many other large airlines struggled, King was credited with transforming British Airways into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world. The flag carrier was privatised and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1987. British Airways effected the takeover of the UK's "second" airline, British Caledonian, in July of that same year.

The formation of <a href="Richard%20Branson">Richard Branson</a>'s <a href="Virgin%20Atlantic">Virgin Atlantic</a> in 1984 created a competitor for BA. The intense rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic culminated in the former being sued for libel in 1993, arising from claims and counter claims over a "dirty tricks" campaign against Virgin. This campaign included allegations of poaching Virgin Atlantic customers, tampering with private files belonging to Virgin and undermining Virgin's reputation in the City. As a result of the case BA management apologised "unreservedly", and the company agreed to pay £110,000 damages to Virgin, £500,000 to Branson personally and £3 million legal costs. Lord King stepped down as chairman in 1993 and was replaced by his deputy, Colin Marshall, while <a href="Robert%20Ayling">Bob Ayling</a> took over as CEO. Virgin filed a separate action in the US that same year regarding BA's domination of the trans-Atlantic routes, but it was thrown out in 1999.

In 1992 British Airways expanded through the acquisition of the financially troubled <a href="Dan-Air">Dan-Air</a>, giving BA a much larger presence at Gatwick airport. <a href="British%20Asia%20Airways">British Asia Airways</a>, a subsidiary based in Taiwan, was formed in March 1993 to operate between London and <a href="Taipei">Taipei</a>. That same month BA purchased a 25% stake in the Australian airline <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> and, with the acquisition of <a href="Brymon%20Airways">Brymon Airways</a> in May, formed British Airways Citiexpress (later <a href="BA%20Connect">BA Connect</a>). In September 1998, British Airways, along with <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a>, <a href="Cathay%20Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a>, Qantas, and <a href="Canadian%20Airlines">Canadian Airlines</a>, formed the <a href="Oneworld">Oneworld</a> <a href="airline%20alliance">airline alliance</a>. Oneworld began operations on 1 February 1999, and is the third largest airline alliance in the world, behind <a href="SkyTeam">SkyTeam</a> and Star Alliance.

Bob Ayling's leadership led to a cost savings of £750m and the establishment of a budget airline, <a href="Go%20%28airline%29">Go</a>, in 1998. The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years. In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced <a href="Rod%20Eddington">Rod Eddington</a> as his successor. That year, British Airways and <a href="KLM">KLM</a> conducted talks on a potential merger, reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission. The plan fell through in September 2000. British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei. Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm <a href="3i">3i</a> in June 2001. Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to reduced demand following 11 September attacks in 2001, and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004. In 2005 <a href="Willie%20Walsh%20%28Irish%20businessman%29">Willie Walsh</a>, managing director of <a href="Aer%20Lingus">Aer Lingus</a> and a former pilot, became the chief executive officer of British Airways. BA unveiled its new subsidiary <a href="OpenSkies">OpenSkies</a> in January 2008, taking advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights between Europe and the United States. OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York's JFK and Newark airports.

On July 2008 British Airways announced a merger plan with <a href="Iberia%20%28airline%29">Iberia</a>, another flag carrier airline in the Oneworld alliance, wherein each airline would retain its original brand. The agreement was confirmed in April 2010, and in July the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">US Department of Transport</a> permitted the merger and began to co-ordinate <a href="transatlantic%20flight">transatlantic</a> routes with American Airlines. On 6 October 2010 the alliance between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia formally began operations. The alliance generates an estimated £230 million in annual cost-saving for BA, in addition to the £330 million which would be saved by the merger with Iberia. This merger was finalised on 21 January 2011, resulting in the International Airlines Group (IAG), the world's third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest airline group in Europe. Prior to merging, British Airways owned a 13.5% stake in Iberia, and thus received ownership of 55% of the combined International Airlines Group; Iberia's other shareholders received the remaining 45%. As a part of the merger, British Airways ceased trading independently on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> after 23 years as a constituent of the <a href="FTSE%20100%20Index">FTSE 100 Index</a>.

In September 2010 Willie Walsh, now CEO of IAG, announced that the group was considering acquiring other airlines and had drawn up a shortlist of twelve possible acquisitions. In November 2011 IAG announced an agreement in principle to purchase British Midland International from <a href="Lufthansa">Lufthansa</a>. A contract to purchase the airline was agreed the next month, and the sale was completed for £172.5 million on 30 March 2012. The airline established a new subsidiary based at <a href="London%20City%20Airport">London City Airport</a> operating <a href="Airbus%20A318">Airbus A318</a>s.

British Airways was the official airline partner of the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">London 2012 Olympic Games</a>. On 18 May 2012 it flew the Olympic flame from <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Athens International Airport</a> to <a href="RNAS%20Culdrose%20%28HMS%20Seahawk%29">RNAS Culdrose</a> while carrying various dignitaries, including Lord <a href="Sebastian%20Coe">Sebastian Coe</a>, <a href="Princess%20Anne">Princess Anne</a>, the Olympics minister <a href="Hugh%20Robertson%20%28politician%29">Hugh Robertson</a> and the London Mayor <a href="Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, along with the footballer <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a>.

On 27 May 2017, British Airways suffered a computer power failure. All flights were cancelled and thousands of passengers were affected. By the following day, the company had not succeeded in reestablishing normal function of their computer systems. When asked by reporters for more information on the ongoing problems, British Airways stated "The root cause was a power supply issue which our affected our IT systems - we continue to investigate this" and declined to comment further. <a href="Willie_Walsh_%28businessman%29">Willie Walsh</a> later attributed the crash to an electrical engineer disconnecting the <a href="Uninterruptible_power_supply">UPS</a> and said there would be an independent investigation.

British Airways is the largest airline based in the United Kingdom in terms of fleet size, international flights, and international destinations and was, until 2008, the largest airline by passenger numbers. The airline carried 34.6 million passengers in 2008, but, rival carrier <a href="easyJet">easyJet</a> transported 44.5 million passengers that year, passing British Airways for the first time. British Airways holds a <a href="Civil%20Aviation%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority</a> Type A Operating Licence, it is permitted to carry passengers, cargo, and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

The airlines' head office, <a href="Waterside%20%28building%29">Waterside</a>, stands in <a href="Harmondsworth">Harmondsworth</a>, a village that is near London Heathrow Airport. Waterside was completed in June 1998 to replace British Airways' previous head office, Speedbird House, which was located on the grounds of Heathrow.

British Airways' main base is at London Heathrow Airport, but it also has a major presence at <a href="Gatwick%20Airport">Gatwick Airport</a>. It also has a base at <a href="London%20City%20Airport">London City Airport</a> (LCY), where its subsidiary <a href="BA%20CityFlyer">BA CityFlyer</a> is the largest operator. BA had previously operated a significant hub at <a href="Manchester%20Airport">Manchester Airport</a>. Manchester to New York (JFK) services were withdrawn; later all international services outside London ceased when the subsidiary <a href="BA%20Connect">BA Connect</a> was sold. Passengers wishing to travel internationally with BA either to or from regional UK destinations must now transfer in London. Heathrow Airport is dominated by British Airways, which owns 40% of the slots available at the airport. The majority of BA services operate from <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Terminal%205">Terminal 5</a>, with the exception of some short-haul and mid-haul flights at <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Terminal%201">Terminal 1</a> arising from the purchase of BMI and some short-haul flights at <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Terminal%203">Terminal 3</a>, owing to a lack of capacity at Terminal 5. With the imminent opening of the brand-new Terminal 2 in 2014, Star Alliance airlines will progressively be moving all their services into the new terminal and Terminal 1 will be closed for demolition in due course. British Airways' services will then be concentrated in Terminals 3 and 5.

In August 2014, Willie Walsh advised the airline would continue to use flight paths over Iraq despite the hostilities there. A few days earlier Qantas announced it would avoid Iraqi airspace, while other airlines did likewise. The issue arose following the downing of <a href="Malaysia%20Airlines%20Flight%2017">Malaysia Airlines Flight 17</a> over Ukraine, and a temporary suspension of flights to and from <a href="Ben%20Gurion%20Airport">Ben Gurion Airport</a> during the <a href="2014%20Israel%E2%80%93Gaza%20conflict">2014 Israel–Gaza conflict</a>.

<a href="BA%20CityFlyer">BA CityFlyer</a>, a wholly owned subsidiary, offers flights from its base at London City Airport to 23 destinations throughout Europe. It flies 17 <a href="Embraer">Embraer</a> E-170/E-190 aircraft and two leased <a href="Saab%202000">Saab 2000</a>. The airline focuses on serving the financial market, though it has recently expanded into the leisure market, offering routes to Ibiza, Palma and Venice. The onboard product is identical to that of the BA Short Haul product from both LHR and LGW.

In March 2015, <a href="Qatar%20Airways">Qatar Airways</a> purchased a 10% stake in <a href="International%20Airlines%20Group">International Airlines Group</a>, the parent of British Airways and <a href="Iberia">Iberia</a>, for €1.2 billion (US$1.26 billion).

BEA Helicopters was renamed <a href="British%20Airways%20Helicopters">British Airways Helicopters</a> in 1974 and operated passenger and offshore oil support services until it was sold in 1986. Other former subsidiaries include the German airline <a href="Deutsche%20BA">Deutsche BA</a> from 1997 until 2003 and the French airline <a href="Air%20Libert%C3%A9">Air Liberté</a> from 1997 to 2001. British Airways also owned Airways Aero Association, the operator of the <a href="Airways%20Flying%20Club">British Airways flying club</a> based at <a href="Wycombe%20Air%20Park">Wycombe Air Park</a> in <a href="High%20Wycombe">High Wycombe</a>, until it was sold to <a href="Surinder%20Arora">Surinder Arora</a> in 2007.

South Africa's <a href="Comair%20%28South%20Africa%29">Comair</a> and Denmark's <a href="Sun%20Air%20of%20Scandinavia">Sun Air of Scandinavia</a> have been <a href="franchisee">franchisee</a>s of British Airways since 1996. British Airways obtained a 15% stake in UK regional airline <a href="Flybe">Flybe</a> from the sale of BA Connect in March 2007. It sold the stake in 2014. BA also owned a 10% stake in InterCapital and Regional Rail (ICRR), the company that managed the operations of <a href="Eurostar%20International%20Limited">Eurostar (UK) Ltd</a> from 1998 to 2010, when the management of Eurostar was restructured.

With the creation of an Open Skies agreement between Europe and the United States in March 2008, British Airways started a new subsidiary airline called <a href="OpenSkies">OpenSkies</a> (previously known as "Project Lauren"). The airline started operations in June 2008, and now flies direct from Paris to New York's JFK and Newark airports.

<a href="British%20Airways%20Ltd%20%282012%E2%80%9315%29">British Airways Limited</a> was established in 2012 to take over the operation of the premium service between London City Airport and New York-JFK. BA began the service in September 2009, using two Airbus A318s fitted with 32 lie-flat beds in an all business class cabin. Flights operate under the numbers previously reserved for Concorde: BA001 — BA004.

British Airways provides cargo services under the <a href="British%20Airways%20World%20Cargo">British Airways World Cargo</a> brand. The division has been part of <a href="IAG%20Cargo">IAG Cargo</a> since 2012, and is the world's twelfth-largest <a href="cargo%20airline">cargo airline</a> based on total freight tonne-kilometres flown. BA World Cargo operates using the main BA fleet. Until the end of March 2014 they also operated three <a href="Boeing%20747-8">Boeing 747-8</a> freighter aircraft providing dedicated long-haul services under a <a href="wet%20lease">wet lease</a> arrangement from <a href="Global%20Supply%20Systems">Global Supply Systems</a>. The division operates an automated cargo centre at London Heathrow Airport and handles freight at Gatwick and Stansted airports.

The key trends for the British Airways Plc Group are shown below.

On the merger with Iberia, the accounting reference date was changed from 31 March to 31 December; figures below are therefore for the years to 31 March up to 2010, for the nine months to 31 December 2010, and for the years to 31 December thereafter:

Staff working for British Airways are represented by a number of trade unions, pilots are represented by <a href="British%20Air%20Line%20Pilots%27%20Association">British Air Line Pilots' Association</a>, cabin crew by <a href="British%20Airlines%20Stewards%20and%20Stewardesses%20Association">British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association</a> (a branch of <a href="Unite%20the%20Union">Unite the Union</a>), while other branches of Unite the Union and the <a href="GMB%20Union">GMB Union</a> represent other employees. Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by cabin crew over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew would strike until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident. In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.

In 2005, wildcat action was taken by union members over a decision by <a href="Gate%20Gourmet">Gate Gourmet</a> not to renew the contracts of 670 workers and replace them with agency staff; it is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30 million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers. In October 2006, BA became involved in a <a href="British%20Airways%20cross%20controversy">civil rights dispute</a> when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the <a href="christian%20cross">cross</a>, a religious symbol. BA's practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly questioned by British politicians such as the former <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="John%20Reid%2C%20Baron%20Reid%20of%20Cardowan">John Reid</a> and the former <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="Jack%20Straw">Jack Straw</a>.

Relations have been turbulent between BA and Unite. In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes to be imposed by BA management. The strike was called off at the last minute, British Airways losing £80 million. In December 2009, a ballot for strike action over Christmas received a high level of support, action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal. Negotiations failed to stop strike action in March, BA withdrew perks for strike participants. Allegations were made by the "Guardian" newspaper that BA had consulted outside firms methods to undermine the unions, the story was later withdrawn. A strike was announced for May 2010, British Airways again sought an injunction. Members of the <a href="Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28UK%29">Socialist Workers Party</a> disrupted negotiations between BA management and Unite to prevent industrial action. Further disruption struck when <a href="Derek%20Simpson%20%28trade%20unionist%29">Derek Simpson</a>, a Unite co-leader, was discovered to have leaked details of confidential negotiations online via Twitter. Industrial action re-emerged in 2017, this time by BA's Mixed Fleet flight attendants, whom were employed on much less favorable pay and terms and conditions compared to previous cabin staff who joined prior to 2010. A ballot for industrial action was distributed to Mixed Fleet crew in November 2016 and resulted in an overwhelming yes majority for industrial action. Unite described Mixed Fleet crew as on "poverty pay", with many Mixed Fleet flight attendants sleeping in their cars in between shifts because they cannot afford the fuel to drive home, or operating while sick as they cannot afford to call in sick and lose their pay for the shift. Unite also blasted BA of removing staff travel concessions, bonus payments and other benefits to all cabin crew who undertook industrial action, as well as strike-breaking tactics such as wet-leasing aircraft from other airlines and offering financial incentives for cabin crew not to strike. The first dates of strikes during Christmas 2016 were cancelled due to pay negotiations. Industrial action by Mixed Fleet commenced in January 2017 after rejecting a pay offer. Strike action continued throughout 2017 in numerous discontinuous periods and as of August 2017, is still ongoing and has become one of the longest running disputes in aviation history.

British Airways serves over 160 destinations, including six domestic.

British Airways <a href="Codeshare%20agreement">codeshares</a> with the following airlines:

Loganair has signed a codeshare agreement with British Airways, effective from 1 September 2017 (coinciding with their launch of independent operations), allowing passengers to book through flights onto BA's global network.

British Airways is a member and one of the founders of <a href="Oneworld">Oneworld</a>, an airline alliance.

With the exception of the <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a> and early <a href="Boeing%20747">Boeing 747</a> variants from BOAC, British Airways inherited a mainly UK-built fleet of aircraft when it was formed in 1974. The airline introduced the <a href="Boeing%20737">Boeing 737</a> and <a href="Boeing%20757">Boeing 757</a> into the fleet in the 1980s, followed by the Boeing 747-400, <a href="Boeing%20767">Boeing 767</a> and <a href="Boeing%20777">Boeing 777</a> in the 1990s. BA is now the largest operator of Boeing 747-400s, with 57 in its fleet. Prior to the introduction of the 787, when Boeing built an aircraft for British Airways, it was allocated the <a href="List%20of%20Boeing%20customer%20codes">customer code</a> "36", which appeared in their aircraft designation as a suffix, such as 737–436.

In 1991, British Airways placed its first order for 777-200 aircraft, ordering another four for fleet expansion in 2007 at a cost of around US$800 million. BA's first 777s were fitted with <a href="General%20Electric%20GE90">General Electric GE90</a> engines, but BA switched to <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Trent%20800">Rolls-Royce Trent 800</a>s for subsequent aircraft.

Later in 2007, BA announced their order of thirty-six new long-haul aircraft, including twelve <a href="Airbus%20A380">Airbus A380</a>s and twenty-four <a href="Boeing%20787%20Dreamliner">Boeing 787 Dreamliner</a>s. <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Trent">Rolls-Royce Trent</a> engines were again selected for both orders with Trent 900s powering the A380s and Trent 1000s powering the 787s. The Boeing 787s will replace 14 of British Airways' Boeing 767 fleet, while the Airbus A380s will replace 20 of BA's Boeing 747-400s and will most likely be used to increase capacity on key routes from London Heathrow.

On 1 August 2008, BA announced orders for six Boeing 777-300ERs and options for four more as an interim measure to cover for delays over the deliveries of their 787-8/9s. Of the six that have been ordered, four will be leased and two will be fully acquired by British Airways.

On 22 April 2013, IAG confirmed that it had signed a memorandum of understanding to order 18 A350-1000 aircraft for British Airways, with an option for a further 18. The aircraft would replace some of the airline's fleet of Boeing 747-400s. Options for 18 Boeing 787 aircraft, part of the original contract signed in 2007, have been converted into firm orders for delivery between 2017 and 2021.

On 26 June 2013, British Airways took delivery of its first 787s. The aircraft began operations to Toronto on 1 September 2013, and began service to Newark on 1 October 2013. BA's first A380 was delivered on 4 July 2013. It began regular services to Los Angeles on 24 September 2013, followed by Hong Kong on 22 October 2013.

The combined International Airlines Group entity (that BA is now a part of), operates around 400 aircraft, carries over 62 million passengers annually, and serves more than 200 destinations.

As of 29 September 2017, the British Airways fleet consists of the following aircraft: 

IAG's cargo division, <a href="IAG%20Cargo">IAG Cargo</a>, handles cargo operations using capacity on British Airways' passenger aircraft. IAG reached an agreement with <a href="Qatar%20Airways">Qatar Airways</a> in 2014 to operate flights for IAG Cargo using <a href="Boeing%20777F">Boeing 777F</a> of <a href="Qatar%20Airways%23Cargo">Qatar Airways Cargo</a>.

<a href="British%20Airways%20World%20Cargo">British Airways World Cargo</a> was the airline's freight division prior to its merger with Iberia Cargo to form IAG Cargo. Aircraft types used by the division between 1974 and 1983 were <a href="Vickers%20Vanguard">Vickers 953C</a>, Boeing 707-300C and <a href="Boeing%20747-200F">Boeing 747-200F</a> while the <a href="Boeing%20747-400F">Boeing 747-400F</a> was operated from the 1990s to 2001 through <a href="Atlas%20Air">Atlas Air</a> and 2002 to early 2012 by <a href="Global%20Supply%20Systems">Global Supply Systems</a>, of these only one of Atlas Air's aircraft wore BA livery, the others flew in Atlas and Global Supply's own colours. From 2012 until the termination of Global Supply System's contract in 2014, three <a href="Boeing%20747-8F">Boeing 747-8F</a> aircraft were flown for British Airways World Cargo.

The company has its own <a href="British%20Airways%20Engineering">engineering branch</a> to maintain its aircraft fleet, this includes line maintenance at over 70 airports around the world. As well as hangar facilities at Heathrow and Gatwick airport it has two major maintenance centres at <a href="Glasgow%20Airport">Glasgow</a> and <a href="British%20Airways%20Maintenance%20Cardiff">Cardiff Airports</a>.

The musical theme predominantly used on British Airways advertising is ""<a href="The%20Flower%20Duet">The Flower Duet</a>"" by <a href="L%C3%A9o%20Delibes">Léo Delibes</a>. This, and the slogan "The World's Favourite Airline" were introduced in 1989 with the launch of the iconic <a href="British%20Airways%20face%20advertisement">"Face" advertisement</a>. The slogan was dropped in 2001 after Lufthansa overtook BA in terms of passenger numbers. "Flower Duet" is still used by the airline, and has been through several different arrangements since 1989. The most recent version of this melody was shown in 2007 with a new slogan: "Upgrade to British Airways". Other advertising slogans have included "The World's Best Airline", "We'll Take More Care of You", and "Fly the Flag".

BA had an account for 23 years with <a href="Saatchi%20%26amp%3B%20Saatchi">Saatchi & Saatchi</a>, an agency that created many of their most famous advertisements, including the influential "Face" campaign. Saatchi & Saatchi later imitated this advert for <a href="Silverjet">Silverjet</a>, a rival of BA, after BA discontinued their business activities. Since 2007 BA has used <a href="Bartle%20Bogle%20Hegarty">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</a> as its advertising agency.

British Airways purchased the <a href="internet%20domain">internet domain</a> ba.com in 2002 from previous owner <a href="Bell%20Atlantic">Bell Atlantic</a>, 'BA' being the company's acronym and its <a href="International%20Air%20Transport%20Association">IATA</a> Airline code. In 2011 BA launched its biggest advertising campaign in a decade, including a 90-second cinematic advert celebrating the airline's ninety-year heritage and a new slogan "To Fly. To Serve".

British Airways is the official airline of the <a href="The%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon">Wimbledon Championship tennis tournament</a>, and was the official airline and tier one partner of the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> and <a href="2012%20Summer%20Paralympics">Paralympics</a>. British Airways was also the official airline of England's bid to host the <a href="2018%20and%202022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20bids">2018 Football World Cup</a>.

"High Life", founded in 1973, is the official in-flight magazine of the airlines.

Since its formation in 1974, British Airways' aeroplanes carried a <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a> scheme painted on their tail fins. The original tail scheme was changed in 1984 as part of a new livery designed by <a href="Landor%20Associates">Landor Associates</a>.

In 1997, there was a controversial change from the use of the former British Airways branding (which incorporated stylised elements of the <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a>) to a new livery which was intended mainly to reflect the diversity of places served by the airline – so-called "World Images". This involved a range of different designs appearing on tailfins and elsewhere, although the bodies of all the planes would use the corporate colours consistently; the exception was the Concorde fleet, which would have a new tailfin design based on a stylised, fluttering Union flag. What became known as the "ethnic images" included Delftware or Chinese calligraphy, related to countries on the company's network of routes. This was reported to have caused problems with <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a>: previously controllers had been able to tell pilots to follow a BA plane, but they were now harder to visually identify. Several people spoke out against the change, including the former Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, who famously covered the tail of a model 747 at an event with a handkerchief, to show her displeasure. BA's traditional rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of the negative press coverage by applying the Union flag to the winglets of their aircraft along with the slogan "Britain's national flagcarrier". In 1999 the CEO of British Airways, Bob Ayling, announced that all BA planes would adopt the tailfin design originally intended to be used only on the Concorde, based on the Union Flag.

British Airways' tiered loyalty programme, called the Executive Club, includes access to special lounges and dedicated "fast" queues. BA also invites its top corporate accounts to join a "Premier" incentive programme. British Airways operates airside lounges for passengers travelling in premium cabins, and these are available to certain tiers of Executive Club members. First class passengers, as well as Gold Executive Club members, are entitled to use First Class Lounges. Business class passengers (called Club World or Club Europe in BA terms) as well as Silver Executive Club members may use Business lounges. At airports in which BA does not operate a departure lounge, a third party lounge is often provided for premium or status passengers. In 2011, due to the merger with Iberia, British Airways announced changes to the Executive Club to maximise integration between the airlines. This included the combination and rebranding of <a href="Air%20Miles%23Air%20Miles%20United%20Kingdom">Air Miles</a>, BA Miles and Iberia Plus points as the IAG operated loyalty programme <a href="Avios">Avios</a>.

Bicycle

A bicycle, also called a cycle or bike, is a <a href="human-powered%20transport">human-powered</a>, <a href="bicycle%20pedal">pedal-driven</a>, <a href="single-track%20vehicle">single-track vehicle</a>, having two <a href="bicycle%20wheel">wheels</a> attached to a <a href="bicycle%20frame">frame</a>, one behind the other. A is called a <a href="Cycling">cyclist</a>, or bicyclist. 

Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion have been produced worldwide. These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.
They are the principal <a href="Mode%20of%20transport">means of transportation</a> in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, <a href="Physical%20fitness">general fitness</a>, military and police applications, <a href="courier%20services">courier services</a>, <a href="bicycle%20racing">bicycle racing</a> and bicycle stunts.

The basic shape and configuration of a typical <a href="Safety%20bicycle">upright or "safety bicycle"</a>, has changed little since the first <a href="Chain%20drive">chain-driven</a> model was developed around 1885. But many details have been improved, especially since the advent of <a href="modern%20materials">modern materials</a> and <a href="computer-aided%20design">computer-aided design</a>. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of <a href="cycling">cycling</a>.

The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including <a href="ball%20bearing">ball bearing</a>s, <a href="pneumatic%20tires">pneumatic tires</a>, <a href="chain-driven%20sprocket">chain-driven sprocket</a>s and <a href="wire%20wheels">tension-spoked wheels</a>.

The word "bicycle" first appeared in English print in "<a href="The%20Daily%20News%20%28UK%29">The Daily News</a>" in 1868, to describe "Bysicles and trysicles" on the "Champs Elysées and Bois de Boulogne." The word was first used in 1847 in a French publication to describe an unidentified two-wheeled vehicle, possibly a carriage. The design of the bicycle was an advance on the <a href="velocipede">velocipede</a>, although the words were used with some degree of overlap for a time.

Other words for bicycle include "bike", "pushbike", "pedal cycle", or "cycle". In <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a>, the <a href="code%20point">code point</a> for "bicycle" is 0x1F6B2. The <a href="Numeric%20character%20reference">entity</a> codice_1 in <a href="HTML">HTML</a> produces 🚲.

The "<a href="Dandy%20horse">Dandy horse</a>", also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine, was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in <a href="tandem">tandem</a> and was invented by the German <a href="Freiherr">Baron</a> <a href="Karl%20Drais">Karl von Drais</a>. It is regarded as the modern bicycle's forerunner; Drais introduced it to the public in <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> in summer 1817 and in Paris in 1818. Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.
The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by <a href="Kirkpatrick%20MacMillan">Kirkpatrick MacMillan</a>, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed. He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a <a href="cycling">cycling</a> traffic offense, when a <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s.

In the early 1860s, Frenchmen <a href="Pierre%20Michaux">Pierre Michaux</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Lallement">Pierre Lallement</a> took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical <a href="Crank%20%28mechanism%29">crank</a> drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the <a href="velocipede">velocipede</a>). This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman <a href="Thomas%20McCall">Thomas McCall</a> in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by Eugène Meyer of Paris. The French "vélocipède", made of iron and wood, developed into the "<a href="penny-farthing">penny-farthing</a>" (historically known as an "ordinary bicycle", a <a href="retronym">retronym</a>, since there was then no other kind). It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor <a href="weight%20distribution">weight distribution</a>. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the <a href="Hillman%23History">Coventry Machinists Company</a>), brought a Michaux cycle to <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a>, England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner <a href="James%20Starley">James Starley</a>, used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.

The "dwarf ordinary" addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel diameter and setting the <a href="bicycle%20seat">seat</a> further back. This, in turn, required gearing—effected in a variety of ways—to efficiently use pedal power. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Englishman <a href="John%20Kemp%20Starley">J. K. Starley</a> (nephew of James Starley), J. H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the <a href="chain%20drive">chain drive</a> (originated by the unsuccessful "bicyclette" of Englishman Henry Lawson), connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as <a href="safety%20bicycle">safety bicycle</a>s, dwarf safeties, or upright bicycles for their lower seat height and better weight distribution, although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller-wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger-wheeled variety. Starley's 1885 <a href="Rover%20Company">Rover</a>, manufactured in Coventry is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle. Soon the "seat tube" was added, creating the modern bike's double-triangle "diamond frame".

Further innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second <a href="bicycle%20craze">bicycle craze</a>, the 1890s "Golden Age of Bicycles". In 1888, Scotsman <a href="John%20Boyd%20Dunlop">John Boyd Dunlop</a> introduced the first practical pneumatic tire, which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear <a href="freewheel">freewheel</a> was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention of <a href="coaster%20brake">coaster brake</a>s. <a href="Derailleur%20gears">Dérailleur gears</a> and hand-operated <a href="Bowden%20cable">Bowden cable</a>-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.

The Svea Velocipede with vertical pedal arrangement and <a href="locking%20hubs">locking hubs</a> was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers <a href="Fredrik%20Ljungstr%C3%B6m">Fredrik Ljungström</a> and <a href="Birger%20Ljungstr%C3%B6m">Birger Ljungström</a>. It attracted attention at the <a href="World%20Fair">World Fair</a> and was produced in a few thousand units.

By the turn of the century, <a href="cycling%20club">cycling club</a>s flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing became widely popular.

Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the widespread advertising, production, and use of these devices. More than 1 billion bicycles have been manufactured worldwide as of the early 21st century. Bicycles are the most common <a href="vehicle">vehicle</a> of any kind in the world, and the most numerous model of any kind of vehicle, whether human-powered or <a href="motor%20vehicle">motor vehicle</a>, is the Chinese <a href="Flying%20Pigeon">Flying Pigeon</a>, with numbers exceeding 500 million. The next most numerous vehicle, the <a href="Honda%20Super%20Cub">Honda Super Cub</a> motorcycle, has more than 60 million units made, while most produced car, the <a href="Toyota%20Corolla">Toyota Corolla</a>, has reached 35 million and counting.

From the beginning and still today, bicycles have been and are employed for many uses. In a utilitarian way, bicycles are used for transportation, <a href="bicycle%20commuting">bicycle commuting</a>, and <a href="utility%20cycling">utility cycling</a>. It can be used as a 'work horse', used by <a href="Bicycle%20mail">mail carriers</a>, <a href="paramedic">paramedic</a>s, <a href="Police%20bicycle">police</a>, <a href="Bicycle%20messenger">messengers</a>, and <a href="Freight%20bicycle">general delivery</a> services. Military uses of bicycles include <a href="Military%20communications">communications</a>, <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>, troop movement, supply of provisions, and <a href="patrol">patrol</a>. See also: <a href="bicycle%20infantry">bicycle infantry</a>.

The bicycle is also used for recreational purposes, such as <a href="bicycle%20touring">bicycle touring</a>, <a href="mountain%20biking">mountain biking</a>, <a href="physical%20fitness">physical fitness</a>, and play. <a href="Cycle%20sport">Bicycle competition</a> includes <a href="Road%20bicycle%20racing">racing</a>, <a href="BMX%20racing">BMX racing</a>, <a href="Track%20cycling">track racing</a>, <a href="criterium">criterium</a>, <a href="bicycle%20rollers">roller racing</a>, <a href="cyclosportive">sportive</a>s and <a href="time%20trial">time trial</a>s. Major multi-stage professional events are the <a href="Giro%20d%27Italia">Giro d'Italia</a>, the <a href="Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>, the <a href="Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">Vuelta a España</a>, the <a href="Tour%20de%20Pologne">Tour de Pologne</a>, and the <a href="Volta%20a%20Portugal">Volta a Portugal</a>.

Bikes can be used for entertainment and pleasure, such as in organised mass rides, <a href="artistic%20cycling">artistic cycling</a> and <a href="freestyle%20BMX">freestyle BMX</a>.

The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception. These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design, allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types, improved <a href="bicycle%20safety">bicycle safety</a>, and riding comfort.

Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include <a href="utility%20bicycle">utility bicycle</a>s, <a href="mountain%20bicycle">mountain bicycle</a>s, <a href="racing%20bicycle">racing bicycle</a>s, <a href="touring%20bicycle">touring bicycle</a>s, <a href="hybrid%20bicycle">hybrid bicycle</a>s, <a href="cruiser%20bicycle">cruiser bicycle</a>s, and <a href="BMX%20bike">BMX bike</a>s. Less common are <a href="tandem%20bicycle">tandems</a>, <a href="Lowrider%20bicycle">low riders</a>, <a href="tall%20bike">tall bike</a>s, <a href="Fixed-gear%20bicycle">fixed gear</a>, <a href="folding%20bicycle">folding models</a>, <a href="amphibious%20bicycles">amphibious bicycles</a>, cargo bikes, <a href="recumbent%20bicycle">recumbents</a> and <a href="electric%20bicycles">electric bicycles</a>.

<a href="Unicycle">Unicycle</a>s, <a href="tricycle">tricycle</a>s and <a href="Quadracycle%20%28human-powered%20vehicle%29">quadracycles</a> are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes" or "cycles".

A bicycle stays upright while moving forward by being steered so as to keep its <a href="center%20of%20mass">center of mass</a> over the wheels. This steering is usually provided by the rider, but under certain conditions may be provided by the bicycle itself.

The combined center of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn to successfully navigate it. This lean is induced by a method known as <a href="countersteering">countersteering</a>, which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the <a href="hand">hand</a>s or indirectly by leaning the bicycle.

Short-wheelbase or tall bicycles, when braking, can generate enough stopping force at the front wheel to flip longitudinally. The act of purposefully using this force to lift the rear wheel and balance on the front without tipping over is a trick known as a <a href="stoppie">stoppie</a>, endo, or front wheelie.

The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms. The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance. From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10–15%.
In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.

A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around uses only the power required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more <a href="aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a>ally streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic <a href="Bicycle%20fairing">fairing</a>. The fastest recorded unpaced speed on a flat surface is 

In addition, the <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> generated in the production and transportation of the food required by the bicyclist, per mile traveled, is less than 1/10 that generated by energy efficient motorcars.

The great majority of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the "diamond frame", a <a href="truss">truss</a> consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the <a href="headset%20%28bicycle%20part%29">headset</a>, the set of bearings that allows the <a href="bicycle%20fork">fork</a> to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the <a href="bottom%20bracket">bottom bracket</a>. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the <a href="bicycle%20chain">chain</a>, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear <a href="Fork%20end">dropout</a>, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.
Historically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower <a href="Frame%20geometry">standover height</a> at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a "<a href="step-through%20frame">step-through frame</a>" or as an "open frame", allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the "<a href="mixte">mixte</a>", which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a "women's" bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.

Step-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles' popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore, it was considered "unladylike" for women to open their legs to mount and dismount - in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse <a href="sidesaddle">sidesaddle</a>.

Another style is the <a href="recumbent%20bicycle">recumbent bicycle</a>. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat. The world's fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the <a href="Union%20Cycliste%20Internationale">Union Cycliste Internationale</a>.
Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind. More expensive bikes use <a href="carbon%20fibre">carbon fibre</a> due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional racing bicycles now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best strength to weight ratio. A typical modern carbon fiber frame can weighs less than .

Other exotic frame materials include <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and advanced alloys. <a href="Bamboo">Bamboo</a>, a natural <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a> with high strength-to-weight ratio and <a href="stiffness">stiffness</a> has been used for bicycles since 1894. Recent versions use bamboo for the primary frame with glued metal connections and parts, priced as exotic models.

The "drivetrain" begins with pedals which rotate the <a href="Crank%20set">cranks</a>, which are held in axis by the bottom bracket. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.

Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or <a href="Cadence%20%28cycling%29">cadence</a>, a variable <a href="gear%20ratio">gear ratio</a> helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use <a href="hub%20gear">hub gear</a>s with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the <a href="chainring">chainring</a> and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.

An alternative to chaindrive is to use a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain - popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a hub gear.

<a href="Bicycle%20gearing">Different gears and ranges of gears</a> are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.

With a "chain drive" transmission, a "chainring" attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (<a href="cassette%20%28bicycle%20part%29">cassette</a> or <a href="Cogset%23Freewheels">freewheel</a>). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).

The <a href="Bicycle%20handlebar">handlebars</a> turn the fork and the front wheel via the <a href="Stem%20%28bike%29">stem</a>, which rotates within the headset. Three styles of handlebar are common. "Upright handlebars", the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. "Drop handlebars" "drop" as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic "crouched" position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.

<a href="Bicycle%20saddle">Saddles</a> also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.

A recumbent bicycle has a reclined <a href="Bicycle%20seat">chair-like seat</a> that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat <a href="Recumbent%20bicycle%23Steering">steering</a>.

Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes. <a href="Disc%20brakes">Disc brakes</a> are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.
With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or <a href="hydraulic">hydraulic</a> lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal "coaster brakes" which were popular in North America until the 1960s.

<a href="Track%20bicycle">Track bicycle</a>s do not have brakes, because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.

Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to "suspend" the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.

Bicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from poor surfaces. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.

Basic mountain bicycles and hybrids usually have front suspension only, whilst more sophisticated ones also have rear suspension. Road bicycles tend to have no suspension.

The wheel axle fits into fork ends in the frame and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.

Tires vary enormously depending on their intended purpose. <a href="Road%20bicycles">Road bicycles</a> use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or <a href="slick%20tire">slick</a>, and inflated to high pressure in order to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between wide, and have treads for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.

Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. <a href="Mudguard">Mudguard</a>s, or <a href="Fender%20%28vehicle%29">fenders</a>, protect the cyclist and <a href="moving%20parts">moving parts</a> from spray when riding through wet areas and <a href="chainguard">chainguard</a>s protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and <a href="crankset">crankset</a> teeth. <a href="Kick%20stand">Kick stand</a>s keep bicycles upright when parked, and <a href="bike%20lock">bike lock</a>s deter theft. Front-mounted <a href="bicycle%20basket">baskets</a>, front or rear <a href="luggage%20carrier">luggage carrier</a>s or racks, and <a href="pannier">pannier</a>s mounted above either or both wheels can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted <a href="Baby%20transport">child seats</a>, an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. <a href="Training%20wheels">Training wheels</a> are sometimes used when learning to ride.

<a href="Clipless%23Clipless%20pedals">Toe-clips</a> and toestraps and <a href="Bicycle%20pedal%23Clipless%20pedals">clipless pedals</a> help keep the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include <a href="cyclocomputer">cyclocomputer</a>s for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include <a href="bicycle%20lighting">lights</a>, reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and <a href="Bottle%20cage">cages</a>, and <a href="Bicycle%20bell">bell</a>. Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing. 

<a href="Bicycle%20helmet">Bicycle helmet</a>s can reduce injury in the event of a collision or accident, and a suitable helmet is legally required of riders in many jurisdictions. Helmets may be classified as an accessory or as an item of clothing.

<a href="Bicycle%20trainer">Bike trainers</a> are used to enable cyclists to cycle while the bike remains stationary. They are frequently used to warm up before races or indoors when riding conditions are unfavorable.

Bicycles can also be fitted with a hitch to tow a <a href="bicycle%20trailer">trailer</a> for carrying cargo, a child, or both.

A number of formal and industry standards exist for bicycle components to help make spare parts exchangeable and to maintain a minimum product safety.

The <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) has a special technical committee for cycles, TC149, that has the following scope: "Standardization in the field of cycles, their components and accessories with particular reference to terminology, testing methods and requirements for performance and safety, and interchangeability."

The <a href="European%20Committee%20for%20Standardization">European Committee for Standardization</a> (CEN) also has a specific Technical Committee, TC333, that defines European standards for cycles. Their mandate states that EN cycle standards shall harmonize with <a href="List%20of%20ISO%20standards">ISO standards</a>. Some CEN cycle standards were developed before ISO published their standards, leading to strong European influences in this area. European cycle standards tend to describe minimum safety requirements, while ISO standards have historically harmonized parts geometry.

Maintenance of adequate tire inflation is the most frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 pounds per square inch that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by <a href="goat%27s%20head">goat's head</a>s and other <a href="bur">bur</a>s, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.

Some bicycle parts, particularly hub-based gearing systems, require considerable torque for dis-assembly and may thus need professional services. <a href="Self-service">Self-service</a> and assisted-service <a href="Maintenance%2C%20repair%2C%20and%20operations">maintenance and repair</a> may be available.


There are specialized bicycle tools for use both in the shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a <a href="Bicycle%20pump">hand pump</a> or <a href="Bicycle%20pump%23CO2%20Inflators">CO Pump</a>, <a href="tire%20lever">tire lever</a>s, spare <a href="Inner%20tube">tubes</a>, self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing "cones." and sometimes even a block of <a href="French%20chalk">French chalk</a>.), <a href="wrench">wrench</a>es, <a href="hex%20key">hex key</a>s, screwdrivers, and a <a href="chain%20tool">chain tool</a>. There are also cycling specific <a href="multi-tool">multi-tool</a>s that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.

The bicycle has had a considerable effect on human society, in both the cultural and industrial realms.

Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.

In built up cities around the world, <a href="urban%20planning">urban planning</a> uses <a href="cycling%20infrastructure">cycling infrastructure</a> like bikeways to reduce <a href="traffic%20congestion">traffic congestion</a> and <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a>. A number of cities around the world have implemented schemes known as <a href="bicycle%20sharing%20system">bicycle sharing system</a>s or community bicycle programs. The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in <a href="La%20Rochelle">La Rochelle</a> and green bicycles in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.

In the Netherlands all train stations offer free bicycle parking, or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded. In <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a> in Norway, the <a href="Trampe%20bicycle%20lift">Trampe bicycle lift</a> has been developed to encourage cyclists by giving assistance on a steep hill. Buses in many cities have <a href="bicycle%20carrier">bicycle carrier</a>s mounted on the front.

There are towns in some countries where <a href="bicycle%20culture">bicycle culture</a> has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of <a href="%C3%8Dlhavo%20Municipality">Ílhavo</a>, in Portugal.

In cities where bicycles are not integrated into the public transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a <a href="mixed-mode%20commuting">mixed-mode commute</a>, where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class. <a href="Folding%20bicycle">Folding bicycle</a>s are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs.
Some US companies, notably in the <a href="High%20tech%23Technology%20sectors">tech sector</a>, are developing both innovative cycle designs and cycle-friendliness in the workplace. <a href="Foursquare">Foursquare</a>, whose <a href="CEO">CEO</a> <a href="Dennis%20Crowley">Dennis Crowley</a> "pedaled to pitch meetings ... [when he] was raising money from <a href="venture%20capitalists">venture capitalists</a>" on a two-wheeler, chose a new location for its <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> headquarters "based on where biking would be easy". Parking in the office was also integral to HQ planning. Mitchell Moss, who runs the <a href="Rudin%20Center%20for%20Transportation%20Policy%20%26amp%3B%20Management">Rudin Center for Transportation Policy & Management</a> at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, said in 2012: "Biking has become the mode of choice for the educated high tech worker."

Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general. In Europe, bicycles are commonly used. They also offer a degree of exercise to keep individuals healthy.

Bicycles are also celebrated in the visual arts. An example of this is the <a href="Bicycle%20Film%20Festival">Bicycle Film Festival</a>, a film festival hosted all around the world.

Experiments done in Uganda, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase a poor family's income as much as 35%. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural <a href="Poverty%20reduction">poverty alleviation</a>, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be an important poverty-eradication tool in poor nations.

The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to <a href="Emancipation%20of%20women">their emancipation</a> in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom that bicycles embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolize the <a href="New%20Woman">New Woman</a> of the late 19th century, especially in Britain and the United States. The <a href="Bike%20boom%231890s">bicycle craze in the 1890s</a> also led to a movement for so-called <a href="Victorian%20dress%20reform">rational dress</a>, which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking <a href="bloomers%20%28clothing%29">bloomers</a>.

The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and <a href="suffragist">suffragist</a>s as a "freedom machine" for women. American <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a> said in a "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>" interview on February 2, 1896:
"I think it has done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood." In 1895 <a href="Frances%20Willard%20%28suffragist%29">Frances Willard</a>, the tightly laced president of the <a href="Woman%E2%80%99s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Woman’s Christian Temperance Union</a>, wrote "A Wheel Within a Wheel: How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, with Some Reflections by the Way", a 75-page illustrated memoir praising "Gladys", her bicycle, for its "gladdening effect" on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action.

<a href="Bicycle%20industry">Bicycle manufacturing</a> proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as <a href="ball%20bearing">ball bearing</a>s, <a href="washer%20%28mechanical%29">washers</a>, and sprockets. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.

<a href="Wright%20brothers">Wilbur and Orville Wright</a>, a pair of businessmen, ran the <a href="Wright%20Cycle%20Company">Wright Cycle Company</a> which designed, manufactured and sold their bicycles during the <a href="bike%20boom">bike boom</a> of the 1890s.

They also served to teach the industrial models later adopted, including mechanization and <a href="mass%20production">mass production</a> (later copied and adopted by <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> and <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>), vertical integration (also later copied and adopted by Ford), aggressive advertising (as much as 10% of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers), lobbying for better roads (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride), all first practiced by Pope. In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change (later derided as <a href="planned%20obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a>, and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.

Early bicycles were an example of <a href="conspicuous%20consumption">conspicuous consumption</a>, being adopted by the fashionable elites. In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which could ultimately cost more than the bicycle itself, it paved the way for the likes of the <a href="Barbie%20doll">Barbie doll</a>.

Bicycles helped create, or enhance, new kinds of businesses, such as bicycle messengers, traveling seamstresses, riding academies, and racing rinks. Their board tracks were later adapted to early <a href="motorcycle%20racing">motorcycle</a> and <a href="automobile%20racing">automobile racing</a>. There were a variety of new inventions, such as <a href="spoke">spoke</a> tighteners, and specialized lights, socks and shoes, and even cameras, such as the <a href="Eastman%20Kodak">Eastman Company</a>'s Poco. Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett's Bike Web, which came to be called the <a href="jock%20strap">jock strap</a>.
They also presaged a move away from public transit that would explode with the introduction of the automobile.

J. K. Starley's company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then simply the <a href="Rover%20Company">Rover Company</a> when it started making cars. <a href="Morris%20Motors">Morris Motors Limited</a> (in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>) and <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Auto">Škoda</a> also began in the bicycle business, as did the <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wright brothers</a>. Alistair Craig, whose company eventually emerged to become the engine manufacturers <a href="Ailsa%20Craig%20Engines">Ailsa Craig</a>, also started from manufacturing bicycles, in Glasgow in March 1885.

In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.

Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as China and India become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles.
One of the major reasons for the proliferation of Chinese-made bicycles in foreign markets is the lower cost of labor in China.

In line with the European financial crisis, in Italy in 2011 the number of bicycle sales (1.75 million) just passed the number of new car sales.

One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from oil consumption.(Ballantine, 1972) The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport. <a href="Ivan%20Illich">Ivan Illich</a> stated that bicycle use extended the usable physical environment for people, while alternatives such as cars and motorways degraded and confined people's environment and mobility.
Currently, two billion bicycles are in use around the world. Children, students, professionals, laborers, civil servants and seniors are pedaling around their communities. They all experience the freedom and the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides. Bicycle also has lowest carbon intensity of travel.

The proper <a href="Islamic%20bicycle">Islamic bicycle</a> for the Iranian women is a topic of heated discussion in both Sunni and Shia Islam.

The global bicycle market is $61 billion in 2011. 130 million bicycles were sold every year globally and 66% of them were made in China.

Early in its development, as with <a href="automobile">automobile</a>s, there were restrictions on the operation of bicycles. Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, <a href="Albert%20A.%20Pope">Albert A. Pope</a> litigated on behalf of cyclists.

The 1968 <a href="Vienna%20Convention%20on%20Road%20Traffic">Vienna Convention on Road Traffic</a> of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>s, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.

In most jurisdictions, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a>-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear <a href="retroreflector">reflectors</a> are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a <a href="car%20horn">car horn</a> can be used when a 12 volt battery is available.

Some countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, <a href="Bicycle%20helmets%20in%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing is one of the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for their own health, and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed <a href="safety%20in%20numbers">safety in numbers</a> effect).

Bicycles are popular targets for theft, due to their value and ease of resaleThe number of bicycles stolen annually is difficult to quantify as a large number of crimes are not reported. Around 50% of the participants in the <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> International Journal of Sustainable Transportation survey were subjected to a bicycle theft in their lifetime as active cyclists. Most bicycles have serial numbers that can be recorded to verify identity in case of theft.

The worlds longest bicycle was created by Santos and University of South Australia. It measures at 41.42 m (135 ft 10.7 in) long.

Biopolymers are <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s produced by <a href="living%20organism">living organism</a>s; in other words, they are polymeric <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a>s. Since they are <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s, biopolymers contain <a href="monomer">monomer</a>ic units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: <a href="polynucleotide">polynucleotide</a>s (<a href="RNA">RNA</a> and <a href="DNA">DNA</a>), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> <a href="monomer">monomer</a>s; <a href="polypeptides">polypeptides</a>, which are short polymers of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s; and <a href="polysaccharides">polysaccharides</a>, which are often linear bonded polymeric <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> structures.

Other examples of biopolymers include <a href="rubber">rubber</a>, <a href="suberin">suberin</a>, <a href="melanin">melanin</a> and <a href="lignin">lignin</a>.

<a href="Cellulose">Cellulose</a> is the most common organic compound and biopolymer on Earth. About 33 percent of all plant matter is cellulose. The cellulose content of cotton is 90 percent, for wood it is 50 percent.

A major defining difference between biopolymers and synthetic polymers can be found in their structures. All polymers are made of repetitive units called <a href="monomer">monomer</a>s. Biopolymers often have a well-defined structure, though this is not a defining characteristic (example: <a href="lignocellulose">lignocellulose</a>): 
The exact chemical composition and the sequence in which these units are arranged is called the <a href="primary%20structure">primary structure</a>, in the case of proteins. Many biopolymers spontaneously fold into characteristic compact shapes (see also "<a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a>" as well as <a href="secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a> and <a href="tertiary%20structure">tertiary structure</a>), which determine their biological functions and depend in a complicated way on their primary structures. <a href="Structural%20biology">Structural biology</a> is the study of the structural properties of the biopolymers.
In contrast, most synthetic polymers have much simpler and more random (or stochastic) structures. This fact leads to a molecular mass distribution that is missing in biopolymers.
In fact, as their synthesis is controlled by a template-directed process in most "in vivo" systems, all biopolymers of a type (say one specific protein) are all alike: they all contain the similar sequences and numbers of monomers and thus all have the same mass. This phenomenon is called <a href="monodispersity">monodispersity</a> in contrast to the <a href="polydispersity">polydispersity</a> encountered in synthetic polymers. As a result, biopolymers have a <a href="polydispersity%20index">polydispersity index</a> of 1.

The convention for a <a href="polypeptide">polypeptide</a> is to list its constituent amino acid residues as they occur from the amino terminus to the carboxylic acid terminus. The amino acid residues are always joined by <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s. <a href="Protein">Protein</a>, though used colloquially to refer to any polypeptide, refers to larger or fully functional forms and can consist of several polypeptide chains as well as single chains. Proteins can also be modified to include non-peptide components, such as <a href="saccharide">saccharide</a> chains and <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s.

The convention for a <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a> sequence is to list the nucleotides as they occur from the 5' end to the 3' end of the <a href="polymer%20chain">polymer chain</a>, where 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of carbons around the ribose ring which participate in forming the phosphate diester linkages of the chain. Such a sequence is called the primary structure of the biopolymer.

Sugar-based biopolymers are often difficult with regards to convention. Sugar polymers can be linear or branched and are typically joined with <a href="glycosidic%20bond">glycosidic bond</a>s. The exact placement of the linkage can vary, and the orientation of the linking functional groups is also important, resulting in α- and β-glycosidic bonds with numbering definitive of the linking carbons' location in the ring. In addition, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical modifications, such as <a href="amination">amination</a>, and can even form parts of other molecules, such as <a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a>s.

There are a number of <a href="biophysics">biophysical</a> techniques for determining sequence information. <a href="Peptide%20sequence">Protein sequence</a> can be determined by <a href="Edman%20degradation">Edman degradation</a>, in which the N-terminal residues are hydrolyzed from the chain one at a time, derivatized, and then identified. Mass <a href="spectrometer">spectrometer</a> techniques can also be used. Nucleic acid sequence can be determined using gel <a href="electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a> and capillary electrophoresis. Lastly, mechanical properties of these biopolymers can often be measured using <a href="optical%20tweezers">optical tweezers</a> or <a href="atomic-force%20microscopy">atomic-force microscopy</a>. <a href="Dual%20polarization%20interferometry">Dual polarization interferometry</a> can be used to measure the conformational changes or self-assembly of these materials when stimulated by pH, temperature, ionic strength or other binding partners.

Some biopolymers- such as <a href="Polylactic%20acid">PLA</a>, naturally occurring <a href="zein">zein</a>, and <a href="poly-3-hydroxybutyrate">poly-3-hydroxybutyrate</a> can be used as plastics, replacing the need for <a href="polystyrene">polystyrene</a> or <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> based plastics.

Some plastics are now referred to as being 'degradable', 'oxy-degradable' or 'UV-degradable'. This means that they break down when exposed to light or air, but these plastics are still primarily (as much as 98 per cent) <a href="oil">oil</a>-based and are not currently certified as 'biodegradable' under the <a href="European%20Union%20directive">European Union directive</a> on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). Biopolymers will break down, and some are suitable for domestic <a href="composting">composting</a>.

Biopolymers (also called renewable polymers) are produced from <a href="biomass">biomass</a> for use in the packaging industry. Biomass comes from crops such as sugar beet, potatoes or wheat: when used to produce biopolymers, these are classified as <a href="non%20food%20crops">non food crops</a>. These can be converted in the following pathways:

Sugar beet > Glyconic acid > Polyglyconic acid

Starch > (fermentation) > <a href="Lactic%20acid">Lactic acid</a> > <a href="Polylactic%20acid">Polylactic acid</a> (PLA)

<a href="Biomass">Biomass</a> > (fermentation) > <a href="Bioethanol">Bioethanol</a> > <a href="Ethene">Ethene</a> > <a href="Polyethylene">Polyethylene</a>

Many types of packaging can be made from biopolymers: food trays, blown starch pellets for shipping fragile goods, thin films for wrapping.

Biopolymers can be sustainable, carbon neutral and are always <a href="renewable">renewable</a>, because they are made from plant materials which can be grown indefinitely. These plant materials come from agricultural <a href="non%20food%20crops">non food crops</a>. Therefore, the use of biopolymers would create a <a href="sustainable">sustainable</a> industry. In contrast, the feedstocks for polymers derived from petrochemicals will eventually deplete. In addition, biopolymers have the potential to cut <a href="carbon%20emissions">carbon emissions</a> and reduce CO quantities in the atmosphere: this is because the CO released when they degrade can be reabsorbed by crops grown to replace them: this makes them close to <a href="carbon%20neutral">carbon neutral</a>.

Biopolymers are biodegradable, and some are also compostable. Some biopolymers are <a href="biodegradable">biodegradable</a>: they are broken down into CO and water by <a href="microorganisms">microorganisms</a>. Some of these biodegradable biopolymers are <a href="compostable">compostable</a>: they can be put into an industrial composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a 'compostable' symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a compostable polymer is PLA film under 20μm thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as compostable, even though they are biodegradable. In Europe there is a home composting standard and associated logo that enables consumers to identify and dispose of packaging in their compost heap.

United Kingdom general election, 2001

The United Kingdom general election of 2001 was held on Thursday 7 June 2001, four years after the previous election on 1 May 1997, to elect <a href="List%20of%20MPs%20elected%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202001">659 members</a> to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British House of Commons</a>. Under the leadership of <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> was re-elected to serve a second term in government with another <a href="landslide%20victory">landslide victory</a>, returning 413 of the 418 seats won by the party in the previous general election, a net loss of 5 seats, though with significantly lower turnout than before - 59.4%, compared to 71.3% in the previous election. Tony Blair went on to become the first Labour <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> to serve a consecutive full term in office. It was dubbed "the quiet landslide" by the media, 

There was little change outside <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, with 620 out of the 641 seats electing candidates from the same party as they did in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997</a>. Factors contributing to the Labour victory were a strong economy and falling unemployment, as well as that Labour was seen as having delivered on many key election pledges that it had made in 1997.

The <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>, under <a href="William%20Hague">William Hague</a>'s leadership, was still deeply divided on the issue of <a href="European%20Union">Europe</a> and the party's policy platform was considered to have shifted to a right wing focus. Hague was also hindered by a series of embarrassing publicity stunts, and resigned as party leader three months later, becoming the first Conservative leader since <a href="Austen%20Chamberlain">Austen Chamberlain</a> to leave office without becoming <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>.

The election was essentially a repeat of the 1997 election, with Labour losing only 6 seats overall and the Conservatives making a net gain of one seat (gaining nine seats, but losing eight). The Conservatives did manage to gain a seat in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, which ended the party's status as an 'England-only' party in the prior parliament. Although they did not gain many seats, one of the new MPs elected was future Conservative Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>. The <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a> gained six seats.

Change was seen in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, with the moderately <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">unionist</a> <a href="Ulster%20Unionist%20Party">Ulster Unionist Party</a> losing four seats to the more hardline <a href="Democratic%20Unionist%20Party">Democratic Unionist Party</a>. This transition was mirrored in the nationalist community with the moderate <a href="Social%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party">SDLP</a> losing votes to the more staunchly republican and abstentionist <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>.

The election was also marked with exceptionally low voter turnout, falling below 60% for the first time since 1918. The election was broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by <a href="Jeremy%20Paxman">Jeremy Paxman</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Marr">Andrew Marr</a>, <a href="Peter%20Snow">Peter Snow</a> and <a href="David%20Dimbleby">David Dimbleby</a>.

The election had been expected on 3 May, to coincide with <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202001">local elections</a>, but both were postponed because of rural movement restrictions imposed in response to the <a href="2001%20UK%20foot%20and%20mouth%20crisis">foot and mouth outbreak</a>.

The elections were marked by voter apathy, with turnout falling to 59.4%, the lowest since the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">Coupon Election</a> of 1918. Throughout the election the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> had maintained a significant lead in the opinion polls and the result was deemed to be so certain that some <a href="bookmaker">bookmaker</a>s paid out for a Labour majority before the election day.

However, the opinion polls the previous autumn had shown the first Tory lead (though only by a narrow margin) in the opinion polls for eight years as they benefited from the public anger towards the government over the <a href="Fuel%20protests%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">fuel protests</a> which had led to a severe shortage of motor fuel.

By the end of 2000, however, the dispute had been solved and Labour were firmly back in the lead of the opinion polls. In total, a mere 29 parliamentary seats changed hands at the 2001 Election.

One of the more noted events of a quiet campaign was when countryside protester Craig Evans threw an egg at <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a href="John%20Prescott">John Prescott</a> in <a href="Rhyl">Rhyl</a>; Prescott then punched him and a struggle ensued, in front of television cameras.

2001 also saw the rare election of an independent. <a href="Richard%20Taylor%20%28UK%20politician%29">Dr. Richard Taylor</a> of <a href="Independent%20Kidderminster%20Hospital%20and%20Health%20Concern">Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern</a> (usually now known simply as "Health Concern") unseated a government minister. There was also a high vote for <a href="British%20National%20Party">British National Party</a> leader <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> in <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, in the wake of recent <a href="2001%20Oldham%20riots">race riots</a> in the town.

In <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, the election was far more dramatic and marked a move by <a href="Unionists%20%28Ireland%29">unionists</a> away from support for the <a href="Good%20Friday%20Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a>, with the moderate unionist <a href="Ulster%20Unionist%20Party">Ulster Unionist Party</a> (UUP) losing to the more hardline <a href="Democratic%20Unionist%20Party">Democratic Unionist Party</a> (DUP). This polarisation was also seen in the nationalist community, with the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> (SDLP) vote losing out to more left-wing and republican <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>. It also saw a tightening of the parties as the small <a href="UK%20Unionist%20Party">UK Unionist Party</a> lost its only seat.

For Labour, the last four years had run relatively smoothly. The party had successfully defended all their <a href="List%20of%20United%20Kingdom%20by-elections">by election</a> seats, and many suspected a Labour win was inevitable from the start.

Many in the party however were afraid of voter apathy, which was epitomised in the "Hague with Lady Thatcher's hair" poster. Despite recessions in mainland Europe and the United States, due to the bursting of global tech bubbles, Britain was notably unaffected and Labour however could rely on a strong economy as unemployment continued to decline toward election day, putting to rest any fears of a Labour government putting the economic situation at risk.

For <a href="William%20Hague">William Hague</a>, however, the Conservative Party had still not fully recovered from the loss in 1997. The party was still divided over Europe, and talk of a referendum on <a href="United%20Kingdom%20and%20the%20euro">joining the Eurozone</a> was rife. As Labour remained at the political centre, the Tories moved to the right. A policy gaffe by <a href="Oliver%20Letwin">Oliver Letwin</a> over public spending cuts left the party with an own goal that Labour soon took advantage of.

<a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> also added to Hague's troubles when speaking out strongly against the Euro to applause. Hague himself, although a witty performer at PMQs, was dogged in the press and reminded of his speech at Conservative conference at the age of 16. The Sun newspaper only added to the Conservatives woes by backing Labour once again, calling Hague a "dead parrot".

The Tories campaigned on a strongly right-wing platform, emphasising the issues of Europe, immigration and tax, the fabled <a href="Norman%20Tebbit">"Tebbit Trinity"</a>. However, Labour countered by asking where the proposed tax cuts were going to come from, and decried the Tory policy as "cut here, cut there, cut everywhere", in reference to the widespread belief that the Conservatives would make major cuts to public services in order to fund tax cuts.

For the Liberal Democrats, this was the first election for leader <a href="Charles%20Kennedy">Charles Kennedy</a>.

During the election Sharron Storer, a resident of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, criticised Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> in front of television cameras about conditions in the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">National Health Service</a>. The widely televised incident happened on 16 May during a campaign visit by Blair to the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Hospital%20Birmingham">Queen Elizabeth Hospital</a> in Birmingham. Sharron Storer's <a href="domestic%20partner">partner</a>, Keith Sedgewick, a cancer patient with <a href="non-Hodgkin%27s%20lymphoma">non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</a> and therefore highly susceptible to infection, was being treated at the time in the <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a> unit, but no bed could be found for him and he was transferred to the casualty unit for his first 24 hours.

The election result was effectively a repeat of 1997, as the Labour party retained an overwhelming majority with <a href="BBC">BBC</a> announcing the victory at 02:58 on the early morning of the 6th June. Having presided over relatively serene political, economic and social conditions, the feeling of prosperity in the United Kingdom had been maintained into the new millennium, and Labour would have a free hand to assert its ideals in the subsequent parliament. Despite the victory, voter apathy was a major issue, as turnout fell below 60%, 12% down on 1997. All of the 3 main parties saw their total votes fall, with Labour's total vote dropping by 2.8 million on 1997, the Conservatives 1.3 million, and the Liberal Democrats 428,000. Some suggested this dramatic fall was a sign of the general acceptance of the status quo and the likelihood of Labour's majority remaining unassailable.

For the Conservatives, this huge loss they had sustained in 1997 was repeated. Despite gaining 9 seats the Tories lost 7 to the Liberal Democrats, and one even to Labour. The inevitable result was the speedy resignation of <a href="William%20Hague">William Hague</a> in the election aftermath resigning at 07:44 outside the Conservative Party headquarters. Some believed that Hague had been unlucky, although most considered him to be a talented orator and an intelligent statesman, he had come up against the charismatic <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> in the peak of his political career, and it was no surprise that little progress was made in reducing Labour's majority after a relatively smooth parliament.

Staying at what they considered rock bottom however showed that the Conservatives had failed to improve their negative public image, had remained somewhat disunited over Europe and had not regained the trust that they had lost in the 1990s. But in Scotland, despite gaining one seat from the SNP, their vote collapse continued. They failed to retake former strongholds in Scotland as the Nationalists consolidated their grip on the Northeastern portion of the country.

The Liberal Democrats could point to steady progress under <a href="Charles%20Kennedy">Charles Kennedy</a>, gaining more seats than the main two parties – albeit only six overall – and maintaining the performance of a pleasing 1997 election, where the party had doubled its number of seats from 20 to 46. While they had yet to become electable as a government, they underlined their growing reputation as a worthwhile alternative to Labour and Conservative, offering plenty of debate in parliament and not just representing a protest vote.

The SNP failed to gain any seats and lost a seat to the Conservatives by just 79 votes. Plaid Cymru both gained a seat from Labour and lost one to them.

In <a href="2001%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%20results%20in%20Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> the Ulster Unionists, despite gaining North Down, lost 5 other seats.

"All parties with more than 500 votes shown."

"The seat gains reflect changes on the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997 general election result</a>. Two seats had changed hands in by-elections in the intervening period. These were as follows:"

The results of the election give a <a href="Gallagher%20Index">Gallagher index of dis-proportionality</a> of 17.74.

Book of Mormon

The Book of Mormon is a <a href="sacred%20text">sacred text</a> of the <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter Day Saint movement</a>, which adherents believe contains writings of ancient <a href="prophet">prophet</a>s who lived on the <a href="Americas">American continent</a> from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421. It was first published in March 1830 by <a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a> as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.

According to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as "<a href="reformed%20Egyptian">reformed Egyptian</a>" engraved on <a href="golden%20plates">golden plates</a>. Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named <a href="Moroni%20%28Book%20of%20Mormon%20prophet%29">Moroni</a>, buried it in <a href="Cumorah">Cumorah Hill</a> in present-day <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, then returned to Earth in 1827 as an <a href="Angel%20Moroni">angel</a>, revealing the location of the plates to Smith, and instructing him to translate it into English for use in the <a href="Restoration%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">restoration</a> of Christ's true church in the <a href="End%20time%23The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">latter days</a>. Critics claim that it was fabricated by Smith, drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record.

The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the <a href="fall%20of%20man">fall</a> of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Adam and Eve</a>, the nature of the <a href="Atonement%20in%20Christianity">Atonement</a>, <a href="eschatology">eschatology</a>, redemption from physical and spiritual death, and the organization of the <a href="Church%20of%20Christ%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">latter-day church</a>. The pivotal event of the book is an <a href="Book%20of%20Mormon%20chronology%23The%20coming%20of%20Christ">appearance of Jesus Christ</a> in the Americas shortly after his resurrection.

The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the <a href="Standard%20works">unique writings</a> of the Latter Day Saint movement, the <a href="List%20of%20sects%20in%20the%20Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">denominations</a> of which typically regard the text primarily as scripture, and secondarily as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after the individuals named as primary authors and, in most versions, divided into chapters and verses. It is written in English very similar to the <a href="Early%20Modern%20English">Early Modern English</a> linguistic style of the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> of the Bible, and has since been fully or partially translated into 108 languages. As of 2011, more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon have been published.

According to Joseph Smith, he was seventeen years of age when an angel of God named <a href="Angel%20Moroni">Moroni</a> appeared to him and said that a collection of ancient writings was buried in a <a href="Cumorah">nearby hill</a> in present-day <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20New%20York">Wayne County, New York</a>, engraved on <a href="golden%20plates">golden plates</a> by ancient prophets. The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus' birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823 and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill; was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions; and that, in four years from this date, the time would arrive for "bringing them forth", i.e., translating them. Smith's description of these events recounts that he was allowed to take the plates on September 22, 1827, exactly four years from that date, and was directed to translate them into English.

Accounts vary of the way in which Smith dictated the Book of Mormon. Smith himself implied that he read the plates directly using spectacles prepared for the purpose of translating. Other accounts variously state that he used one or more <a href="seer%20stones%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">seer stones</a> placed in a top hat. Both the special spectacles and the seer stone were at times referred to as the "<a href="Urim%20and%20Thummim%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Urim and Thummim</a>". During the translating process itself, Smith sometimes separated himself from his scribe with a blanket between them. Additionally, the plates were not always present during the translating process, and when present, they were always covered up.

Smith's first published description of the plates said that the plates "had the appearance of gold". They were described by <a href="Martin%20Harris%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Martin Harris</a>, one of Smith's early scribes, as "fastened together in the shape of a book by wires." Smith called the engraved writing on the plates "<a href="reformed%20Egyptian">reformed Egyptian</a>". A portion of the text on the plates was also "<a href="Golden%20plates%23%26quot%3BSealed%26quot%3B%20portion">sealed</a>" according to his account, so its content was not included in the Book of Mormon.

In addition to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others stated that they saw the golden plates and, in some cases, handled them. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of <a href="Three%20Witnesses">Three Witnesses</a> and the Testimony of <a href="Eight%20Witnesses">Eight Witnesses</a>. These statements have been published in most editions of the Book of Mormon.
Smith enlisted his neighbor <a href="Martin%20Harris%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Martin Harris</a> as a scribe during his initial work on the text. (Harris later mortgaged his farm to underwrite the printing of the Book of Mormon.) In 1828, Harris, prompted by his wife <a href="Lucy%20Harris">Lucy Harris</a>, repeatedly requested that Smith lend him the current pages that had been translated. Smith reluctantly acceded to Harris's requests. Lucy Harris is thought to have stolen the <a href="Lost%20116%20pages">first 116 pages</a>. After the loss, Smith recorded that he had lost the ability to translate, and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented. Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin translating another part of the plates (in what is now called the Book of Mosiah). In 1829, work resumed on the Book of Mormon, with the assistance of <a href="Oliver%20Cowdery">Oliver Cowdery</a>, and was completed in a short period (April–June 1829). Smith said that he then returned the plates to Moroni upon the publication of the book. The Book of Mormon went on sale at the bookstore of <a href="E.%20B.%20Grandin">E. B. Grandin</a> in <a href="Palmyra%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Palmyra, New York</a> on March 26, 1830. Today, the building in which the Book of Mormon was first published and sold is known as the <a href="Book%20of%20Mormon%20Historic%20Publication%20Site">Book of Mormon Historic Publication Site</a>.

Since its first publication and distribution, critics of the Book of Mormon have claimed that it was fabricated by Smith and that he drew material and ideas from various sources rather than translating an ancient record. Works that have been suggested as sources include the <a href="King%20James%20Bible">King James Bible</a>, "<a href="The%20Wonders%20of%20Nature">The Wonders of Nature</a>", "<a href="View%20of%20the%20Hebrews">View of the Hebrews</a>", and <a href="Spalding%E2%80%93Rigdon%20theory%20of%20Book%20of%20Mormon%20authorship">an unpublished manuscript</a> written by <a href="Solomon%20Spalding">Solomon Spalding</a>. <a href="FairMormon">FairMormon</a> maintains that all of these theories have been disproved and discredited, arguing that both Mormon and non-Mormon historians have found serious flaws in their research The position of most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement and the official position of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church) is that the book is an accurate historical record.

Smith stated that the title page, and presumably the actual title of the 1830 edition, came from the translation of "the very last leaf" of the golden plates, and was written by the prophet-historian <a href="Moroni%20%28Book%20of%20Mormon%20prophet%29">Moroni</a>. The title page states that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is "to [show] unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; ... and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations."

The Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the <a href="First%20Book%20of%20Nephi">First Book of Nephi</a> (1 Nephi) and ending with the <a href="Book%20of%20Moroni">Book of Moroni</a>.

The book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the <a href="Words%20of%20Mormon">Words of Mormon</a> and the <a href="Book%20of%20Ether">Book of Ether</a>. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by <a href="Mormon%20%28prophet%29">Mormon</a>. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. First Nephi through <a href="Book%20of%20Omni">Omni</a> are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether).

Most modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the "Testimony of <a href="Three%20Witnesses">Three Witnesses</a>" and the "Testimony of <a href="Eight%20Witnesses">Eight Witnesses</a>".

The books from <a href="Book%20of%20First%20Nephi">First Nephi</a> to <a href="Book%20of%20Omni">Omni</a> are described as being from "the small plates of Nephi". This account begins in ancient <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named <a href="Lehi%20%28Book%20of%20Mormon%20prophet%29">Lehi</a>, his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the <a href="Babylonians">Babylonians</a> in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the <a href="Arabian%20peninsula">Arabian peninsula</a>, and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship. These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the <a href="Nephite">Nephite</a>s and the <a href="Lamanite">Lamanite</a>s, that frequently warred with each other.

Following this section is the <a href="Words%20of%20Mormon">Words of Mormon</a>. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by <a href="Mormon%20%28prophet%29">Mormon</a>, is a short introduction to the books of <a href="Book%20of%20Mosiah">Mosiah</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Alma">Alma</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Helaman">Helaman</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Third%20Nephi">Third Nephi</a>, and <a href="Book%20of%20Fourth%20Nephi">Fourth Nephi</a>. These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called "the large plates of Nephi" that detailed the people's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The <a href="Book%20of%20Third%20Nephi">Book of Third Nephi</a> is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> sometime after his <a href="Death%20and%20Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a> and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the <a href="Gospels">Gospels</a> of the Bible and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.

The portion of the greater Book of Mormon called the <a href="Book%20of%20Mormon%20%28Mormon%27s%20record%29">Book of Mormon</a> is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough. The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon is eventually killed after having handed down the records to his son Moroni.

According to the text, Moroni then made an abridgment (called the <a href="Book%20of%20Ether">Book of Ether</a>) of a record from a previous people called the <a href="Jaredites">Jaredites</a>. The account describes a group of families led from the <a href="Tower%20of%20Babel">Tower of Babel</a> to the Americas, headed by a man named <a href="Jared%20%28Book%20of%20Mormon%29">Jared</a> and <a href="The%20Brother%20of%20Jared">his brother</a>. The <a href="Jaredite">Jaredite</a> civilization is presented as existing on the American continent beginning about 2500 BC,—long before Lehi's family arrived shortly after 600 BC—and as being much larger and more developed.

The <a href="Book%20of%20Moroni">Book of Moroni</a> then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the <a href="idolatry">idolatrous</a> state of the remaining society. It also includes significant doctrinal teachings and closes with Moroni's <a href="testimony">testimony</a> and an invitation to <a href="prayer">pray</a> to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account.

The Book of Mormon contains doctrinal and philosophical teachings on a wide range of topics, from basic themes of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> to political and ideological teachings. Jesus is mentioned every 1.7 verses and is referred to by one hundred different names.

Stated on the title page, the Book of Mormon's central purpose is for the "convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations."

The book describes Jesus, prior to his birth, as a spirit "without flesh and blood", although with a spirit "body" that looked similar to how Jesus would appear during his physical life. Jesus is described as "the Father and the Son". He is said to be: "God himself [who] shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people ... [b]eing the Father and the Son—the Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son—and they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth." Other parts of the book portray the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as "one." As a result, beliefs among the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement encompass <a href="nontrinitarian">nontrinitarian</a>ism (in <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>) to <a href="trinitarianism">trinitarianism</a> (particularly among the <a href="Community%20of%20Christ">Community of Christ</a>). See <a href="Godhead%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Godhead (Latter Day Saints)</a>.

In furtherance of its theme of reconciling Jews and Gentiles to Jesus, the book describes a variety of visions or visitations to some early inhabitants in the Americas involving Jesus. Most notable among these is a described visit of Jesus to a group of early inhabitants shortly after his <a href="resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a>. Many of the book's contributors described other visions of Jesus, including one by the <a href="Brother%20of%20Jared">Brother of Jared</a> who, according to the book, lived before Jesus, and saw the "body" of Jesus' spirit thousands of years prior to his birth. According to the book, a <a href="Nephi%2C%20son%20of%20Lehi">narrator named Nephi</a> described a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus, including a prophecy of Jesus' name, said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus' birth.

In the narrative, at the time of <a href="King%20Benjamin">King Benjamin</a> (about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called "the children of Christ". At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of <a href="Captain%20Moroni">Captain Moroni</a> (73 BC) were called "Christians" by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ. The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments. Later, the prophet <a href="Mormon%20%28prophet%29">Mormon</a> worked to convince the faithless people of his time (AD 360) of Christ. Many other prophets in the book write of the reality of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

In the Bible, Jesus spoke to the <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> of "other sheep" who would hear his voice. The Book of Mormon claims this meant that the Nephites and other remnants of the <a href="Ten%20Lost%20Tribes">lost tribes</a> of <a href="Israel">Israel</a> throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his <a href="Death%20and%20Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a>.

On most religious issues, Book of Mormon doctrines are similar to those found in the Bible and among other Christian denominations. Among its somewhat distinctive theological interpretations are the following:

The book delves into <a href="political%20theology">political theology</a> within a Christian or Jewish context. Among these themes are <a href="American%20exceptionalism">American exceptionalism</a>. According to the book, the Americas are portrayed as a "land of promise", the world's most exceptional land of the time. The book states that any righteous society possessing the land would be protected, whereas if they became wicked they would be destroyed and replaced with a more righteous civilization.

On the issue of war and violence, the book teaches that war is justified for people to "defend themselves against their enemies". However, they were never to "give an offense," or to "raise their sword ... except it were to preserve their lives." The book praises the faith of <a href="Ammonites%20%28Book%20of%20Mormon%29">a group</a> of former warriors who took an oath of complete <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a>, refusing to take arms even to defend themselves and their people. However, 2,000 of their descendants, who had not taken the oath of their parents not to take up arms against their enemies, chose to go to battle against the Lamanites, and it states that in their battles the 2,000 men were protected by God through their faith and, though many were injured, none of them died.

The book recommends monarchy as an ideal form of government, but only when the monarch is righteous. The book warns of the evil that occurs when the king is wicked, and therefore suggests that it is not generally good to have a king. The book further records the decision of the people to be ruled no longer by kings, choosing instead a form of democracy led by elected judges. When citizens referred to as "king-men" attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces. The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of what appears to be a peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again.

The book supports notions of economic justice, achieved through voluntary donation of "substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor." In one case, all the citizens held their property in common. When individuals within a society began to disdain and ignore the poor, to "wear costly apparel", and otherwise engage in wickedness for personal gain, such societies are repeatedly portrayed in the book as being ripe for destruction.

<a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a> characterized the Book of Mormon as the "keystone" of Mormonism, and claimed that it was "the most correct of any book on earth". Smith produced a written <a href="revelation%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">revelation</a> in 1832 that condemned the "whole church" for treating the Book of Mormon lightly.

The Book of Mormon is one of four sacred texts or <a href="standard%20works">standard works</a> of the LDS Church. Church leaders have frequently restated Smith's claims of the book's significance to the faith. Church members believe that the Book of Mormon is more correct than the Bible because the Bible was the result of a multiple-generation translation process and the Book of Mormon was not.

For most of the history of the LDS Church, the Book of Mormon was not used as much as other books of scripture such as the New Testament and the Doctrine and Covenants. This changed in the 1980s when efforts were made to reemphasize the Book of Mormon. As part of this effort, a new edition was printed
with the added subtitle "Another Testament of Jesus Christ".

The importance of the Book of Mormon was a focus of <a href="Ezra%20Taft%20Benson">Ezra Taft Benson</a>, the church's thirteenth <a href="President%20of%20the%20Church%20%28LDS%20Church%29">president</a>. Benson stated that the church was still under condemnation for treating the Book of Mormon lightly. In an August 2005 message, LDS Church president <a href="Gordon%20B.%20Hinckley">Gordon B. Hinckley</a> challenged each member of the church to re-read the Book of Mormon before the year's end. The book's importance is commonly stressed at the twice-yearly <a href="General%20Conference%20%28LDS%20Church%29">general conference</a>, at special devotionals by <a href="General%20Authority">general authorities</a>, and in the church's teaching publications. Since the late 1980s, church members have been encouraged to read from the Book of Mormon daily.

The LDS Church encourages discovery of the book's truth by following the suggestion in its final chapter to study, ponder, and pray to God concerning its veracity. This passage is sometimes referred to as "Moroni's Promise".

As of April 2011, the LDS Church has published more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon.

The <a href="Community%20of%20Christ">Community of Christ</a>, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, <a href="Herald%20House">Herald House</a>: the Authorized Edition, which is based on the original printer's manuscript, and the 1837 Second Edition (or "Kirtland Edition") of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 "Revised Authorized Edition", which attempts to modernize some language.

In 2001, Community of Christ President <a href="W.%20Grant%20McMurray">W. Grant McMurray</a> reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: "The proper use of The Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity."

At the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference, President <a href="Stephen%20M.%20Veazey">Stephen M. Veazey</a> ruled out-of-order a resolution to "reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record." He stated that "while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church."

There are a number of other <a href="List%20of%20sects%20in%20the%20Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">churches</a> that are part of the Latter Day Saint movement. Most of these churches were created as a result of issues ranging from differing doctrinal interpretations and acceptance of the movement's scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, to disagreements as to who was the divinely chosen successor to Joseph Smith. These groups all have in common the acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. It is this acceptance which distinguishes the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement from other Christian denominations. Separate editions of the Book of Mormon have been published by a number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, along with private individuals and foundations not endorsed by any specific denomination.

The archaeological, historical and scientific communities are generally skeptical of the claims that the Book of Mormon is an ancient record of actual historical events. This skepticism tends to focus on four main areas:


Most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account. Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are several <a href="Mormon%20apologetics">apologetic</a> groups that disagree with the skeptics and seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by <a href="FARMS">Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies</a> (FARMS), and <a href="Foundation%20for%20Apologetic%20Information%20%26amp%3B%20Research">Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research</a> (FAIR), defending the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the <a href="limited%20geography%20model">limited geography model</a>, which states that the people of the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>, <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, or the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> area. The LDS Church has published material indicating that science will support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.

The Book of Mormon was dictated by Joseph Smith to several <a href="scribe">scribe</a>s over a period of 13 months, resulting in three <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s.

The 116 lost pages contained the first portion of the <a href="Book%20of%20Lehi">Book of Lehi</a>; it was lost after Smith loaned the original, uncopied manuscript to <a href="Martin%20Harris%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Martin Harris</a>.

The first completed manuscript, called the original manuscript, was completed using a variety of scribes. Portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. In October 1841, the entire original manuscript was placed into the <a href="cornerstone">cornerstone</a> of the <a href="Nauvoo%20House">Nauvoo House</a>, and sealed up until nearly forty years later when the cornerstone was reopened. It was then discovered that much of the original manuscript had been destroyed by water seepage and mold. Surviving manuscript pages were handed out to various families and individuals in the 1880s.

Only 28 percent of the original manuscript now survives, including a remarkable find of fragments from 58 pages in 1991. The majority of what remains of the original manuscript is now kept in the LDS Church's Archives.

The second completed manuscript, called the printer's manuscript, was a copy of the original manuscript produced by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes. It is at this point that initial <a href="copyediting">copyediting</a> of the Book of Mormon was completed. Observations of the original manuscript show little evidence of corrections to the text. Shortly before his death in 1850, Cowdery gave the printer's manuscript to <a href="David%20Whitmer">David Whitmer</a>, another of the <a href="Three%20Witnesses">Three Witnesses</a>. In 1903, the manuscript was bought from Whitmer's grandson by the Community of Christ, known at the time as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On September 20, 2017, the LDS Church purchased the manuscript from the Community of Christ at a reported price of $35 million. The printer's manuscript is now the earliest surviving complete copy of the Book of Mormon, being nearly 100 percent extant. The manuscript was imaged in 1923 and was recently made available for viewing online.

Critical comparisons between surviving portions of the manuscripts show an average of two to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text. The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.

The printer's manuscript was not used fully in the <a href="typesetting">typesetting</a> of the 1830 version of Book of Mormon; portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. The original manuscript was used by Smith to further correct errors printed in the 1830 and 1837 versions of the Book of Mormon for the 1840 printing of the book.

In the late 19th century the extant portion of the printer's manuscript remained with the family of <a href="David%20Whitmer">David Whitmer</a>, who had been a principal founder of the <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saints">Latter Day Saints</a> and who, by the 1870s, led the <a href="Church%20of%20Christ%20%28Whitmerite%29">Church of Christ (Whitmerite)</a>. During the 1870s, according to the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", the <a href="LDS%20Church">LDS Church</a> unsuccessfully attempted to buy it from Whitmer for a record price. LDS president <a href="Joseph%20F.%20Smith">Joseph F. Smith</a> refuted this assertion in a 1901 letter, believing such a manuscript "possesses no value whatever." In 1895, David Whitmer's grandson George Schweich inherited the manuscript. By 1903 Schweich had mortgaged the manuscript for $1,800 and neededing to raise at least that sum, sold a collection including this 72-percent of the Book of the original the printer's manuscript (John Whitmer’s manuscript history, parts of Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible, manuscript copies of several revelations, and a piece of paper containing copied Book of Mormon characters) to the RLDS church (now the Community of Christ) for $2,450, with $2,300 of this amount for the printer's manuscript. The LDS Church had not sought to purchase the manuscript.

In 2015 this remaining portion was published by the <a href="Church%20Historian%27s%20Press">Church Historian's Press</a> in its "<a href="Joseph%20Smith%20Papers">Joseph Smith Papers</a>" series, in Volume Three of "Revelations and Translations"; and, in 2017, the <a href="LDS%20Church">LDS Church</a> bought the printer's manuscript for .

The original 1830 publication did not have verse markers, although the individual books were divided into relatively long chapters. Just as the Bible's present chapter and verse notation system is a later addition of Bible publishers to books that were originally solid blocks of undivided text, the chapter and verse markers within the books of the Book of Mormon are conventions, not part of the original text.

Publishers from different factions of the Latter Day Saint movement have published different chapter and verse notation systems. The two most significant are the LDS system, introduced in 1879, and the RLDS system, which is based on the original 1830 chapter divisions.

The RLDS 1908 edition, RLDS 1966 edition, the <a href="Church%20of%20Christ%20%28Temple%20Lot%29">Church of Christ (Temple Lot)</a> edition, and Restored Covenant editions use the RLDS system while most other current editions use the LDS system.

The Book of Mormon is currently printed by the following publishers:
The following non-current editions marked major developments in the text or reader's helps printed in the Book of Mormon.
The following versions are published online:

In 1989, scholars at <a href="Brigham%20Young%20University">Brigham Young University</a> began work on a <a href="Textual%20criticism">critical text</a> edition of the Book of Mormon. Volumes 1 and 2, published in 2001, contain transcriptions of all the text variants of the English editions of the Book of Mormon, from the original manuscript to the newest editions. Volume 4, which is being published in parts, is a critical analysis of all the text variants. Volume 3, which is not yet published, will describe the history of all the English-language texts from Joseph Smith to today.

Differences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past.

The LDS version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages. In 2001, the LDS Church reported that all or part of the Book of Mormon was available in the native language of 99 percent of <a href="Latter-day%20Saints">Latter-day Saints</a> and 87 percent of the world's total population.

Translations into languages without a tradition of writing (e.g., <a href="Kaqchikel%20language">Kaqchikel</a>, <a href="Tzotzil%20language">Tzotzil</a>) are available on audio cassette. Translations into <a href="American%20Sign%20Language">American Sign Language</a> are available on videocassette and DVD.

Typically, translators are members of the LDS Church who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed several times before it is approved and published.

In 1998, the LDS Church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon, and instead announced that each new translation it approves will be a full edition.

Events of the Book of Mormon are the focus of several <a href="List%20of%20films%20of%20The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">LDS Church films</a>, including "<a href="The%20Life%20of%20Nephi">The Life of Nephi</a>" (1915), "<a href="How%20Rare%20a%20Possession">How Rare a Possession</a>" (1987) and "<a href="The%20Testaments%20of%20One%20Fold%20and%20One%20Shepherd">The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd</a>" (2000). Such films in <a href="LDS%20cinema">LDS cinema</a> (i.e., films not officially commissioned by the LDS Church) include "" (2003) and "<a href="Passage%20to%20Zarahemla">Passage to Zarahemla</a>" (2007).

<a href="Second%20Book%20of%20Nephi">Second Nephi</a> <a href="http%3A//www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.20-27%2319">9:20–27</a> from the Book of Mormon is quoted in a funeral service in <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s film "<a href="Family%20Plot">Family Plot</a>".

In 2003, a "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>" episode titled "<a href="All%20About%20Mormons">All About Mormons</a>" parodied the origins of the Book of Mormon.

In 2011, a long-running <a href="religious%20satire">religious satire</a> <a href="musical%20theatre">musical</a> titled "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Mormon%20%28musical%29">The Book of Mormon</a>", by the South Park creators, premiered on <a href="Broadway%20%28theatre%29">Broadway</a>, winning 9 <a href="Tony%20Awards">Tony Awards</a>, including best musical. Its London production won the <a href="Olivier%20Award">Olivier Award</a> for best musical.

The LDS Church, which distributes free copies of the Book of Mormon, reported in 2011 that 150 million copies of the book have been printed since its initial publication.

The initial printing of the Book of Mormon in 1830 produced 5000 copies. The 50 millionth copy was printed in 1990, with the 100 millionth following in 2000 and reaching 150 million in 2011.

Baptists are individuals who comprise a group of <a href="Evangelical">Evangelical</a> <a href="Christian%20denomination">Christian denomination</a>s and churches that subscribe to a doctrine that <a href="baptism">baptism</a> should be performed only for professing believers (<a href="believer%27s%20baptism">believer's baptism</a>, as opposed to <a href="infant%20baptism">infant baptism</a>), and that it must be done by complete <a href="Immersion%20baptism">immersion</a> (as opposed to <a href="affusion">affusion</a> or <a href="Aspersion">sprinkling</a>). Other <a href="Dogma">tenets</a> of Baptist churches include <a href="soul%20competency">soul competency</a> (liberty), <a href="salvation">salvation</a> through <a href="Sola%20fide">faith alone</a>, <a href="Sola%20scriptura">Scripture alone</a> as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local <a href="Congregationalist%20polity">congregation</a>. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, <a href="Elder%20%28Christianity%29">elder</a>s and <a href="deacon">deacon</a>s. Baptist churches are widely considered to be <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> churches, though some Baptists <a href="Early%20Christianity">disavow</a> this identity.

Diverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward other Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship.

Historians trace the earliest church labeled "Baptist" back to 1609 in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, with <a href="English%20Dissenters">English Separatist</a> <a href="John%20Smyth%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">John Smyth</a> as its pastor. In accordance with his reading of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the "<a href="General%20Baptists">General Baptists</a>" considered Christ's atonement to <a href="Unlimited%20atonement">extend to all people</a>, while the "<a href="Particular%20Baptists">Particular Baptists</a>" believed that it extended only to <a href="Election%20%28Christianity%29">the elect</a>. <a href="Thomas%20Helwys">Thomas Helwys</a> formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the <a href="Baptists%20in%20the%20history%20of%20separation%20of%20church%20and%20state">church and the state be kept separate</a> in matters of law, so that individuals might have a <a href="Religious%20liberty">freedom of religious conscience</a>. Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious persecution of <a href="English%20dissenters">English dissenters</a> under <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James I</a>. In 1638, <a href="Roger%20Williams%20%28theologian%29">Roger Williams</a> established the <a href="first%20Baptist%20church%20in%20America">first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies</a>. In the mid-18th century, the <a href="First%20Great%20Awakening">First Great Awakening</a> contributed to Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The <a href="Second%20Great%20Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a> in the South in the early 19th century greatly increased church membership. Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent.

The largest Baptist denomination is the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a>, with the membership of associated churches totaling more than 15 million.

Baptist historian Bruce Gourley outlines four main views of Baptist origins: (1) The modern scholarly consensus that the movement traces its origin to the 17th century via the <a href="English%20Dissenters">English Separatists</a>, (2) the view that it was an outgrowth of Anabaptist traditions, (3) the perpetuity view which assumes that the Baptist "faith and practice" has existed since the time of Christ, and (4) the successionist view, or "<a href="Baptist%20successionism">Baptist successionism</a>", which argues that Baptist "churches" actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ.

Modern Baptist churches trace their history to the <a href="English%20Dissenters">English Separatist</a> movement in the 1600s, the century after the rise of the original Protestant denominations. This view of Baptist origins has the most historical support and is the most widely accepted. Adherents to this position consider the influence of Anabaptists upon early Baptists to be minimal. It was a time of considerable political and religious turmoil. Both individuals and churches were willing to give up their theological roots if they became convinced that a more biblical "truth" had been discovered.

During the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> (Anglicans) separated from the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. There were some Christians who were not content with the achievements of the mainstream Protestant Reformation. There also were Christians who were disappointed that the Church of England had not made corrections of what some considered to be errors and abuses. Of those most critical of the Church's direction, some chose to stay and try to make constructive changes from within the Anglican Church. They became known as "<a href="Puritans">Puritans</a>" and are described by Gourley as cousins of the English Separatists. Others decided they must leave the Church because of their dissatisfaction and became known as the Separatists.

Historians trace the earliest Baptist church back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with <a href="John%20Smyth%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">John Smyth</a> as its pastor. Three years earlier, while a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, he had broken his ties with the Church of England. Reared in the Church of England, he became "Puritan, English Separatist, and then a Baptist Separatist," and ended his days working with the Mennonites. He began meeting in England with 60–70 English Separatists, in the face of "great danger." The persecution of religious nonconformists in England led Smyth to go into exile in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> with fellow Separatists from the congregation he had gathered in Lincolnshire, separate from the established church (Anglican). Smyth and his lay supporter, <a href="Thomas%20Helwys">Thomas Helwys</a>, together with those they led, broke with the other English exiles because Smyth and Helwys were convinced they should be baptized as believers. In 1609 Smyth first baptized himself and then baptized the others.

In 1609, while still there, Smyth wrote a tract titled "The Character of the Beast," or "The False Constitution of the Church." In it he expressed two propositions: first, infants are not to be baptized; and second, "Antichristians converted are to be admitted into the true Church by baptism." Hence, his conviction was that a scriptural church should consist only of regenerate believers who have been baptized on a personal confession of faith. He rejected the Separatist movement's doctrine of infant baptism (<a href="paedobaptism">paedobaptism</a>). Shortly thereafter, Smyth left the group, and layman Thomas Helwys took over the leadership, leading the church back to England in 1611. Ultimately, Smyth became committed to believers' baptism as the only biblical baptism. He was convinced on the basis of his interpretation of Scripture that infants would not be damned should they die in infancy.
Smyth, convinced that his self-baptism was invalid, applied with the <a href="Mennonites">Mennonites</a> for membership. He died while waiting for membership, and some of his followers became Mennonites. Thomas Helwys and others kept their baptism and their Baptist commitments. The modern Baptist denomination is an outgrowth of Smyth's movement. Baptists rejected the name Anabaptist when they were called that by opponents in derision. McBeth writes that as late as the 18th century, many Baptists referred to themselves as "the Christians commonly—though "falsely"—called Anabaptists."

Another milestone in the early development of Baptist doctrine was in 1638 with <a href="John%20Spilsbury%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">John Spilsbury</a>, a Calvinistic minister who helped to promote the strict practice of believer's <a href="Immersion%20baptism">baptism by immersion</a>. According to Tom Nettles, professor of historical theology at <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Theological%20Seminary">Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</a>, "Spilsbury's cogent arguments for a gathered, disciplined congregation of believers baptized by immersion as constituting the New Testament church gave expression to and built on insights that had emerged within separatism, advanced in the life of John Smyth and the suffering congregation of Thomas Helwys, and matured in Particular Baptists."

A minority view is that early 17th century Baptists were influenced by (but not directly connected to) continental <a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a>s. According to this view, the General Baptists shared similarities with Dutch Waterlander Mennonites (one of many Anabaptist groups) including believer's baptism only, religious liberty, separation of church and state, and <a href="Arminianism">Arminian</a> views of salvation, predestination and original sin. Representative writers including A.C. Underwood and William R. Estep. Gourley wrote that among some contemporary Baptist scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty, the Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback.

However, the relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were early strained. In 1624, the then five existing Baptist churches of London issued a condemnation of the Anabaptists. Furthermore, the original group associated with Smyth and popularly believed to be the first Baptists broke with the Waterlander Mennonite Anabaptists after a brief period of association in the Netherlands.

Prior to the 20th century, Baptist historians generally wrote from the perspective that Baptists had existed since the time of Christ. Proponents of the Baptist successionist or perpetuity view consider the Baptist movement to have existed independently from <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a> and prior to the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>.

The perpetuity view is often identified with "<a href="The%20Trail%20of%20Blood">The Trail of Blood</a>", a booklet of five lectures by J.M. Carrol published in 1931. Other Baptist writers who advocate the successionist theory of Baptist origins are <a href="John%20T.%20Christian">John T. Christian</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Crosby%20%28Baptist%29">Thomas Crosby</a>, G. H. Orchard, J. M. Cramp, William Cathcart, Adam Taylor and D. B. Ray This view was also held by English Baptist preacher, <a href="Charles%20Spurgeon">Charles Spurgeon</a> as well as <a href="Jesse%20Mercer">Jesse Mercer</a>, the namesake of Mercer University.

In 1612, <a href="Thomas%20Helwys">Thomas Helwys</a> established a Baptist congregation in London, consisting of congregants from Smyth's church. A number of other Baptist churches sprang up, and they became known as the General Baptists. The Particular Baptists were established when a group of Calvinist Separatists adopted believers' Baptism.

Both <a href="Roger%20Williams">Roger Williams</a> and <a href="John%20Clarke%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">John Clarke</a>, his compatriot and coworker for religious freedom, are variously credited as founding the earliest Baptist church in North America. In 1639, Williams established a Baptist church in <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>, and Clarke began a Baptist church in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>. According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter extensively, "There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first' Baptist congregation in America. Exact records for both congregations are lacking."

The <a href="Great%20Awakening">Great Awakening</a> energized the Baptist movement, and the Baptist community experienced spectacular growth. Baptists became the largest Christian community in many southern states, including among the black population.

Baptist missionary work in Canada began in the British colony of <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> (present day Nova Scotia and <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>) in the 1760s. The first official record of a Baptist church in Canada was that of the Horton Baptist Church (now Wolfville) in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on 29 October 1778. The church was established with the assistance of the <a href="New%20Light">New Light</a> evangelist <a href="Henry%20Alline">Henry Alline</a>. Many of Alline's followers, after his death, would convert and strengthen the Baptist presence in the Atlantic region. Two major groups of Baptists formed the basis of the churches in the Maritimes. These were referred to as Regular Baptist (Calvinistic in their doctrine) and Free Will Baptists.

In May 1845, the Baptist congregations in the United States split over slavery and missions. The <a href="American%20Baptist%20Home%20Mission%20Society">Home Mission Society</a> prevented slaveholders from being appointed as missionaries. The split created the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a>, while the northern congregations formed their own umbrella organization now called the <a href="American%20Baptist%20Churches%20USA">American Baptist Churches USA</a> (ABC-USA). The <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church%2C%20South">Methodist Episcopal Church, South</a> had recently separated over the issue of slavery, and southern <a href="Presbyterians">Presbyterians</a> would do so shortly thereafter.

Many Baptist churches choose to affiliate with organizational groups that provide fellowship without control. The largest such group is the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a>. There also are a substantial number of <a href="List%20of%20Baptist%20sub-denominations">smaller cooperative groups</a>. Finally, there are <a href="Independent%20Baptist">Independent Baptist</a> churches that choose to remain autonomous and independent of any denomination, organization, or association. It has been suggested that a primary Baptist principle is that local Baptist Churches are independent and self-governing, and if so the term 'Baptist denomination' may be considered somewhat incongruous.

In 1925, Baptists worldwide formed the <a href="Baptist%20World%20Alliance">Baptist World Alliance</a> (BWA). The BWA now counts 218 Baptist conventions and unions worldwide with over 41 million members. The BWA's goals include caring for the needy, leading in world evangelism and defending human rights and religious freedom. Though it played a role in the founding of the BWA, the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> severed its affiliation with BWA in 2004.

Today, more than 100 million Christians identify themselves as Baptist or belong to Baptist-type churches. There are 36 million Baptists who belong to churches cooperating with the <a href="Baptist%20World%20Alliance">Baptist World Alliance</a>. Many Baptist groups, including the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> and the <a href="Baptist%20Bible%20Fellowship">Baptist Bible Fellowship</a> do not cooperate with the Alliance.

Baptists are present in almost all continents in big denominations. The largest number by baptized memberships are in Nigeria (3.5 million) and <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (2 million) in Africa, India (2.5 million) and <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> (1 million) in Asia, United States (35 million) and Brazil (1.8 million) in the North and South America.

According to the Barna Group researchers, Baptists are the largest denominational grouping of <a href="Born%20again%20%28Christianity%29">born again Christians</a> in the USA. A 2009 ABCNEWS/Beliefnet phone poll of 1,022 adults suggests that fifteen percent of Americans identify themselves as Baptists.

A large percentage of Baptists in North America are found in five bodies—the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> (SBC); <a href="National%20Baptist%20Convention%2C%20USA%2C%20Inc.">National Baptist Convention</a> (NBC); <a href="National%20Baptist%20Convention%20of%20America%2C%20Inc.">National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.</a>; (NBCA); <a href="American%20Baptist%20Churches%20USA">American Baptist Churches USA</a> (ABC); and <a href="Baptist%20Bible%20Fellowship%20International">Baptist Bible Fellowship International</a> (BBFI).

Membership policies vary due to the autonomy of churches, but the traditional method by which an individual becomes a member of a church is through <a href="believer%27s%20baptism">believer's baptism</a>, which is a public profession of faith in Jesus, followed by water baptism.

Most baptists do not believe that baptism is a requirement for salvation, but rather a public expression of one's inner repentance and faith. Therefore, some churches will admit into membership persons who make a profession without believer's baptism.

In general, Baptist churches do not have a stated age restriction on membership, but believer's baptism requires that an individual be able to freely and earnestly profess their faith. (See <a href="Believer%27s%20Baptism%23Age%20of%20accountability">Age of Accountability</a>)

Baptists, like other Christians, are defined by doctrine—some of it common to all orthodox and evangelical groups and a portion of it distinctive to Baptists. Through the years, different Baptist groups have issued confessions of faith—without considering them to be "creeds"—to express their particular doctrinal distinctions in comparison to other Christians as well as in comparison to other Baptists. Most Baptists are evangelical in doctrine, but Baptist beliefs can vary due to the congregational governance system that gives autonomy to individual local Baptist churches. Historically, Baptists have played a key role in encouraging religious freedom and separation of church and state.

Shared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth; miracles; atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of <a href="Jesus%20in%20Christianity">Jesus</a>; the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the son of God, his death and resurrection, and confession of Christ as Lord); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (eschatology) (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth, the dead will be raised, and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions. Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the <a href="1689%20London%20Baptist%20Confession%20of%20Faith">1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith</a>, 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the <a href="1833%20New%20Hampshire%20Baptist%20Confession%20of%20Faith">1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith</a>, the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a>'s "<a href="Baptist%20Faith%20and%20Message">Baptist Faith and Message</a>," and written <a href="church%20covenant">church covenant</a>s which some individual Baptist churches adopt as a statement of their faith and beliefs.

Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control.

Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of <a href="Elder%20%28Christianity%29%23Baptists">elders</a>, as well as the <a href="Episcopal%20Baptist">Episcopal Baptist</a>s that have an <a href="Episcopal%20polity">Episcopal system</a>.

Baptists generally believe in the literal <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a> of Christ. Beliefs among Baptists regarding the "<a href="Christian%20eschatology">end times</a>" include <a href="amillennialism">amillennialism</a>, <a href="dispensationalism">dispensationalism</a>, and historic <a href="premillennialism">premillennialism</a>, with views such as <a href="postmillennialism">postmillennialism</a> and <a href="preterism">preterism</a> receiving some support.

Some additional distinctive Baptist principles held by many Baptists:

Since there is no hierarchical authority and each Baptist church is autonomous, there is no official set of Baptist theological beliefs. These differences exist both among associations, and even among churches within the associations.

Some doctrinal issues on which there is widespread difference among Baptists are:

Baptists have faced many controversies in their 400-year history, controversies of the level of crises. Baptist historian Walter Shurden says the word "crisis" comes from the Greek word meaning "to decide." Shurden writes that contrary to the presumed negative view of crises, some controversies that reach a crisis level may actually be "positive and highly productive." He claims that even schism, though never ideal, has often produced positive results. In his opinion crises among Baptists each have become decision-moments that shaped their future. Some controversies that have shaped Baptists include the "missions crisis", the "slavery crisis", the "landmark crisis", and the "modernist crisis".

Early in the 19th century, the rise of the modern <a href="Mission%20%28Christian%29">missions</a> movement, and the backlash against it, led to widespread and bitter controversy among the American Baptists. During this era, the American Baptists were split between missionary and anti-missionary. A substantial secession of Baptists went into the movement led by <a href="Alexander%20Campbell%20%28clergyman%29">Alexander Campbell</a>, to return to a more fundamental church.

Leading up to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Baptists became embroiled in the controversy over <a href="slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery in the United States</a>. Whereas in the First <a href="Great%20Awakening">Great Awakening</a>, <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the <a href="American%20Baptist%20Home%20Mission%20Society">Home Mission Society</a> refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the board did not want to appear to condone slavery.

The <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> was formed by nine state conventions in 1845. They believed that the Bible sanctions slavery and that it was acceptable for Christians to own slaves. They believed slavery was a human institution which Baptist teaching could make less harsh. By this time many planters were part of Baptist congregations, and some of the denomination's prominent preachers, such as the Rev. <a href="Basil%20Manly%2C%20Sr.">Basil Manly, Sr.</a>, president of the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama">University of Alabama</a>, were also <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">planters</a> who owned slaves.

As early as the late 18th century, black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies, especially in the northern states. Blacks set up some independent Baptist congregations in the South before the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. White Baptist associations maintained some oversight of these and, after a slave rebellion, required a white man to be at church services.

In the postwar years, <a href="freedmen">freedmen</a> quickly left the white congregations and associations, setting up their own churches in order to be free of white supervision. In 1866 the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions, which they did in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, and <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. In 1880 black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention, to support black Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the <a href="National%20Baptist%20Convention%2C%20USA%2C%20Inc.">National Baptist Convention</a>. This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest black religious organization and the second-largest Baptist organization in the world. Baptists are numerically most dominant in the Southeast. In 2007, the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a>'s Religious Landscape Survey found that 45% of all African Americans identify with Baptist denominations, with the vast majority of those being within the historically black tradition.

Elsewhere in the Americas, in the Caribbean in particular, Baptist missionaries and members took an active role in the anti-slavery movement. In Jamaica, for example, <a href="William%20Knibb">William Knibb</a>, a prominent British Baptist missionary, worked toward the emancipation of slaves in the <a href="British%20West%20Indies">British West Indies</a> (which took place in full in 1838). Knibb also supported the creation of "<a href="Free%20Villages">Free Villages</a>" and sought funding from English Baptists to buy land for freedmen to cultivate; the Free Villages were envisioned as rural communities to be centred around a Baptist church where emancipated slaves could farm their own land. <a href="Thomas%20Burchell">Thomas Burchell</a>, missionary minister in <a href="Montego%20Bay">Montego Bay</a>, also was active in this movement, gaining funds from Baptists in England to buy land for what became known as Burchell Free Village.

Prior to emancipation, Baptist deacon <a href="Samuel%20Sharpe">Samuel Sharpe</a>, who served with Burchell, organized a general strike of slaves seeking better conditions. It developed into a major rebellion of as many as 60,000 slaves, which became known as the Christmas Rebellion (when it took place) or the <a href="Baptist%20War">Baptist War</a>. It was put down by government troops within two weeks. During and after the rebellion, an estimated 200 slaves were killed outright, with more than 300 judicially executed later by prosecution in the courts, sometimes for minor offenses.

Baptists were active after emancipation in promoting the education of former slaves; for example, Jamaica's <a href="Calabar%20High%20School">Calabar High School</a>, named after the port of <a href="Calabar">Calabar</a> in Nigeria, was founded by Baptist missionaries. At the same time, during and after slavery, slaves and free blacks formed their own <a href="Spiritual%20Baptist">Spiritual Baptist</a> movements - breakaway spiritual movements which theology often expressed resistance to oppression.

In the American South the interpretation of the American Civil War, abolition of slavery and postwar period has differed sharply by race since those years. Like other peoples, Americans have often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black memory by analyzing Baptist sermons documented in Alabama. It should be noted that, soon after the Civil War, most black Baptists in the South left the southern Baptist Convention, reducing its numbers by hundreds of thousands or more. They quickly organized their own congregations and developed their own regional and state associations and, by the end of the 19th century, a national convention.

White preachers in Alabama after Reconstruction expressed the view that:
Black preachers interpreted the Civil War, Emancipation and Reconstruction as:
"God's gift of freedom." They had a gospel of liberation, having long identified with the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a> from slavery in the Old Testament. They took opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they quickly formed their own churches, associations, and conventions to operate freely without white supervision. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, a place to develop and use leadership, and places for proclamation of the gospel of liberation. As a result, black preachers said that God would protect and help him and God's people; God would be their rock in a stormy land.

The Southern Baptist Convention supported white supremacy and its results: <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disenfranchising most blacks and many poor whites</a> at the turn of the 20th century by raising barriers to voter registration, and passage of <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> laws that enforced the system of <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a>. Its members largely resisted the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> in the South, which sought to enforce their constitutional rights for public access and voting; and enforcement of midcentury federal civil rights laws.

On 20 June 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery. More than 20,000 Southern Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta. The resolution declared that messengers, as SBC delegates are called, "unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as deplorable sin" and "lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest." It offered an apology to all African Americans for "condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime" and repentance for "racism of which we have been guilty, whether consciously or unconsciously." Although Southern Baptists have condemned racism in the past, this was the first time the convention, predominantly white since the Reconstruction era, had specifically addressed the issue of slavery.

The statement sought forgiveness "from our African-American brothers and sisters" and pledged to "eradicate racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry." In 1995 about 500,000 members of the 15.6-million-member denomination were African Americans and another 300,000 were <a href="ethnic">ethnic</a> minorities. The resolution marked the denomination's first formal acknowledgment that <a href="racism">racism</a> played a role in its founding.

Southern Baptist <a href="Landmarkism">Landmarkism</a> sought to reset the <a href="ecclesiastical%20separation">ecclesiastical separation</a> which had characterized the old Baptist churches, in an era when inter-denominational union meetings were the order of the day. <a href="James%20Robinson%20Graves">James Robinson Graves</a> was an influential Baptist of the 19th century and the primary leader of this movement. While some Landmarkers eventually separated from the Southern Baptist Convention, the movement continued to influence the Convention into the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, in 2005, the Southern Baptist International Mission Board forbade its missionaries to receive alien immersions for baptism.

The rise of <a href="Fundamentalist%E2%80%93Modernist%20Controversy">theological modernism</a> in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries also greatly affected Baptists. The Landmark movement, already mentioned, has been described as a reaction among Southern Baptists in the United States against incipient modernism . In England, <a href="Charles%20Haddon%20Spurgeon">Charles Haddon Spurgeon</a> fought against modernistic views of the Scripture in the <a href="Downgrade%20Controversy">Downgrade Controversy</a> and severed his church from the Baptist Union as a result.

The <a href="Northern%20Baptist%20Convention">Northern Baptist Convention</a> in the United States had internal conflict over modernism in the early 20th century, ultimately embracing it. Two new conservative associations of congregations that separated from the Convention were founded as a result: the <a href="General%20Association%20of%20Regular%20Baptist%20Churches">General Association of Regular Baptist Churches</a> in 1933 and the <a href="Conservative%20Baptist%20Association%20of%20America">Conservative Baptist Association of America</a> in 1947.

Following similar conflicts over modernism, <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention%20conservative%20resurgence">the Southern Baptist Convention adhered to conservative theology</a> as its official position. In the late 20th century, moderate Southern Baptists who disagreed with this direction founded two new groups: the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Baptists">Alliance of Baptists</a> in 1987 and the <a href="Cooperative%20Baptist%20Fellowship">Cooperative Baptist Fellowship</a> in 1991. Members of both groups originally continued to identify as Southern Baptist, but over time the groups "became permanent new families of Baptists."

Blackjack

Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing <a href="card%20game">card game</a> between usually several players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer, but players do not play against each other. It is played with one or more <a href="Playing%20card">decks</a> of 52 cards, and is the most widely played <a href="casino%20game">casino</a> banking game in the world.. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:


Players are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table at which you sit. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called "soft", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card; the value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is "hard".

Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer’s turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received Blackjacks. The dealer must hit until the cards total 17 or more points. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a "soft" 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have the same total (not counting blackjacks), this is called a "push", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand. Otherwise, the dealer wins.

Blackjack has many rule variations. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high-profile target of <a href="Advantage%20gambling">advantage players</a>, particularly <a href="card%20counting">card counters</a>, who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wagers and playing strategies accordingly.

Blackjack has inspired other casino games, including <a href="Spanish%2021">Spanish 21</a> and <a href="Pontoon%20%28card%20game%29">pontoon</a>.

Blackjack's precursor was "twenty-one", a game of unknown origin. The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author <a href="Miguel%20de%20Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a>, most famous for writing "<a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>". Cervantes was a <a href="gambler">gambler</a>, and the main characters of his tale "<a href="Rinconete%20y%20Cortadillo">Rinconete y Cortadillo</a>", from "<a href="Novelas%20Ejemplares">Novelas Ejemplares</a>", are a couple of cheats working in <a href="Seville">Seville</a>. They are proficient at cheating at "veintiuna" (Spanish for twenty-one), and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without going over and that the <a href="ace">ace</a> values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish "<a href="Baraja%20%28playing%20cards%29">baraja</a>" deck, which lacks eights and nines. This short story was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that "ventiuna" was played in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castilla</a> since the beginning of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain.

When twenty-one was introduced in the United States, gambling houses offered bonus payouts to stimulate players' interest. One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the <a href="ace%20of%20spades">ace of spades</a> and a black <a href="jack%20%28playing%20card%29">jack</a> (either the <a href="jack%20of%20clubs">jack of clubs</a> or the <a href="jack%20of%20spades">jack of spades</a>). This hand was called a "blackjack", and the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn. In the modern game, a "blackjack" refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card regardless of suits or colours.

The first scientific and mathematically sound attempt to devise an optimal blackjack playing strategy was revealed in September 1956. Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel and James McDermott published a paper titled The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. This paper would become the foundation of all future sound efforts to beat the game of blackjack. <a href="Ed%20Thorp">Ed Thorp</a> would use Baldwin’s hand calculations to verify the basic strategy and later publish (in 1963) his famous book Beat the Dealer.

At a casino blackjack table, the dealer faces five to seven playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight <a href="standard%2052-card%20deck">standard 52-card deck</a>s are <a href="shuffling">shuffled</a> together. At the beginning of each round, up to three players can place their bets in the "betting box" at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position at a table in jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is at the front of the betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to "play behind". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.

The dealer deals cards from his/her left (the position on the dealer's far left is often referred to as "first base") to his/her far right ("third base"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in "hole card" games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor that is used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, "no hole card" games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.

Cards are dealt either from one or two handheld decks, from a <a href="shoe%20%28cards%29">dealer's shoe</a>, or from a <a href="shuffling%20machine">shuffling machine</a>. Single cards are dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's left, followed by a single card to the dealer, followed by an additional card to each of the positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face up or face down (more common in single-deck games).

The players' object is to win money by creating card totals that turn out to be higher than the dealer's hand but do not exceed 21 ("busting"/"breaking"), or alternatively by allowing the dealer to take additional cards until he/she busts. On their turn, players must choose whether to "hit" (take a card), "stand" (end their turn), "double" (double wager, take a single card and finish), "split" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or "surrender" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as "face cards" or "pictures") count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace, or "soft 17", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a "natural" or "blackjack" and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as "push" or "standoff", bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for winning, player blackjacks, which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet), or one-and-a-half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables; for instance, single-deck blackjack tables often pay 6:5 for a blackjack instead of 3:2.

Blackjack games almost always provide a <a href="side%20bet">side bet</a> called insurance, which may be played when dealer's upcard is an ace. Additional side bets, such as "Dealer Match" which pays when the player's cards match the dealer's up card, are sometimes available.

After receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: "hit", "stand", "double down", or "split". Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, "surrender".

Hand signals are used to assist the "<a href="eye%20in%20the%20sky%20%28camera%29">eye in the sky</a>", a person or <a href="video%20camera">video camera</a> located above the table and sometimes concealed behind <a href="one-way%20glass">one-way glass</a>. The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify <a href="advantage%20players">advantage players</a> whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence.

Each hand may normally "hit" as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard 20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is normally required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the players' wagers are immediately forfeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved (usually in <a href="counterclockwise">counterclockwise</a> order): bets on losing hands are forfeited, the bet on a push is left on the table, and winners are paid out.

If the dealer's upcard is an ace, the player is offered the option of taking "insurance" before the dealer checks the hole card.

Insurance is a side bet that the dealer has blackjack and is treated independently of the main wager. It pays 2:1 (meaning that the player receives two dollars for every dollar bet) and is available when the dealer's exposed card is an ace. The idea is that the dealer's second card has a fairly high probability (nearly one-third) to be ten-valued, giving the dealer blackjack and disappointment for the player. It is attractive (although not necessarily wise) for the player to insure against the possibility of a dealer blackjack by making a maximum "insurance" bet, in which case the "insurance proceeds" will make up for the concomitant loss on the original bet. The player may add up to half the value of their original bet to the insurance and these extra chips are placed on a portion of the table usually marked "Insurance pays 2 to 1".

Players with a blackjack may also take insurance, and in taking maximum insurance they commit themselves to winning an amount exactly equal to their main wager, regardless of the dealer's outcome. Fully insuring a blackjack against blackjack is thus referred to as "taking even money", and paid out immediately, before the dealer's hand is resolved; the players do not need to place more chips for the insurance wager.

Insurance bets are expected to lose money in the long run, because the dealer is likely to have blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly <a href="correlation">anti-correlated</a> with that of the main wager, and if the player's priority is to reduce <a href="variance">variation</a>, they might choose to pay for this.

Furthermore, the insurance bet is susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card has more than a chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is a good bet simply by observing the other cards on the table after the deal; even if there are just 2 player hands exposed, and neither of their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is a good bet. This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.

Bets to insure against blackjack are slightly less likely to be advantageous than insurance bets in general, since the ten in the player's blackjack makes it less likely that the dealer has blackjack too.

"Note: where changes in the house edge due to changes in the rules are stated in percentage terms, the difference is usually stated here in <a href="percentage%20point">percentage point</a>s, not percentage; strictly speaking if, say, an edge of 10% is reduced to 9%, the amount is reduced by ten percent, or by one percentage point."

The rules of casino blackjack are generally determined by law or regulation, which establishes certain rule variations allowed at the discretion of the casino. The rules of any particular game are generally posted on or near the table, failing which there is an expectation that casino staff will provide them on request. Over 100 variations of blackjack have been documented.

As with all casino games, blackjack incorporates a "house edge", a statistical advantage for the casino that is built into the game. The advantage of the dealer's position in blackjack relative to the player comes from the fact that if the player busts, the player loses, regardless of whether the dealer subsequently busts. Nonetheless, blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1% of their total wagered amount with strictly average luck; this is very favorable to the player compared to other casino games. The loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through ignorance is generally expected to be greater.




Surrender, for those games that allow it, is usually not permitted against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked to make sure there is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as "late" surrender. The alternative, "early" surrender, gives player the option to surrender "before" the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early surrender is much more favorable to the player than late surrender. Most medium-strength hands should be surrendered against a dealer Ace if the hole card has not been checked.

For late surrender, however, while it is tempting to opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.


In most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, meaning that the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have finished making decisions. With no hole card, it is almost never correct basic strategy to double or split against a dealer ten or ace, since a dealer blackjack will result in the loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of A's against a dealer 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no hole card game. The no hole card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.

The "original bets only" rule variation appearing in certain no hole card games states that if the player's hand loses to a dealer blackjack, only the mandatory initial bet ("original") is forfeited, and all optional bets, meaning doubles and splits, are pushed. "Original bets only" is also known by the acronym OBO; it has the same effect on basic strategy and house edge as reverting to a hole card game.


Each blackjack game has a "basic strategy", which is playing a hand of any total value against any dealer's up-card, which loses the least money to the house in the long term.

An example of basic strategy is shown in the table below, and includes the following parameters: 

Key:

The bulk of basic strategy is common to all blackjack games, with most rule variations calling for changes in only a few situations. For example, if the above game used the hit on soft 17 rule, common in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Strip">Las Vegas Strip</a> casinos, only 6 cells of the table would need to be changed: double on 11 "vs." A, surrender 15 or 17 "vs." A, double on A,7 "vs." 2, double on A,8 "vs." 6, surrender (if not allowed, then hit) on 8,8 "vs." A. Also when playing basic strategy never take insurance or "even money."

Estimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size.

Most blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games. Casino promotions such as complimentary matchplay vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.

Basic strategy is based upon a player's point total and the dealer's visible card. Players may be able to improve on this decision by considering the precise composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. However, in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the player's hand has two consequences:

However, even when basic and composition-dependent strategy lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small, and it becomes even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.

Blackjack has been a high-profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play is the attempt to win more using skills such as memory, computation, and observation. These techniques, while generally legal, can be powerful enough to give the player a long-term edge in the game, making them an undesirable customer for the casino and potentially leading to ejection or <a href="blacklist">blacklist</a>ing if they are detected. The main techniques of advantage play in blackjack are as follows:

During the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer exposes the dealt cards. Careful accounting of the exposed cards allows a player to make inferences about the cards which remain to be dealt. These inferences can be used in the following ways:

A card counting system assigns a point score to each rank of card (e.g., 1 point for 2–6, 0 points for 7–9 and −1 point for 10–A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'. A card counter uses this count to make betting and playing decisions according to a table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for "balanced" counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends on the number of decks used in the game.

Blackjack's house edge is usually between 0.5%–1% when players use basic strategy. Card counting can give the player an edge of up to 2% over the house.

Card counting is most rewarding near the end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly susceptible to card counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.

Card counting is legal and is not considered cheating as long as the counter isn't using an external device, but if a casino realizes a player is counting, the casino might inform them that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property.

The use of external devices to help counting cards is illegal in all US states that license blackjack card games.

Techniques other than card counting can swing the advantage of casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques are based on the value of the cards to the player and the casino as originally conceived by <a href="Edward%20O.%20Thorp">Edward O. Thorp</a>. One technique, mainly applicable in multi-deck games, involves tracking groups of cards (also known as slugs, clumps, or packs) during the play of the shoe, following them through the shuffle, and then playing and betting accordingly when those cards come into play from the new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.

Arnold Snyder's articles in "<a href="Blackjack%20Forum">Blackjack Forum</a>" magazine brought shuffle tracking to the general public. His book, "The Shuffle Tracker's Cookbook," mathematically analyzed the player edge available from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug. <a href="Jerry%20L.%20Patterson">Jerry L. Patterson</a> also developed and published a shuffle-tracking method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play.

The player can also gain an advantage by identifying cards from distinctive wear markings on their backs, or by "hole carding" (observing during the dealing process the front of a card dealt face down). These methods are generally legal although their status in particular jurisdictions may vary.

Many blackjack tables offer a side bet on various outcomes including:

The side wager is typically placed in a designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side bet is usually required to place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet regardless of whether the controlling player does so.

The house edge for side bets is generally far higher than for the blackjack game itself. Nonetheless side bets can be susceptible to card counting. A side count, designed specifically for a particular side bet, can improve the player edge. Most side games do not offer a sufficient win rate to justify the effort of advantage play; exceptions include "Lucky ladies" and "Over/Under".

In team play it is common for team members to be dedicated toward counting only a sidebet using a specialized count.

Blackjack can be played in tournament form. Players start with an equal numbers of chips; the goal is to finish among the top chip-holders. Depending on the number of competitors, tournaments may be held over several rounds, with one or two players qualifying from each table after a set number of deals to meet the qualifiers from the other tables in the next round. Another tournament format, <a href="Elimination%20Blackjack">Elimination Blackjack</a>, drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can differ from non-tournament strategy because of the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an initial entry fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.

Some casinos, as well as general betting outlets, provide blackjack among a selection of casino-style games at electronic consoles. Video blackjack game rules are generally more favorable to the house; e.g., paying out only even money for winning blackjacks. Video and online blackjack games deal each coup from a fresh shoe, rendering card counting much less effective.

Blackjack is a member of a large family of traditional card games played recreationally all around the world. Most of these games have not been adapted for casino play. Furthermore, the casino game development industry is very active in producing blackjack variants, most of which are ultimately not adopted for widespread use in casinos. The following are the prominent twenty-one themed comparing card games which have been adapted or invented for use in casinos and have become established in the gambling industry.


Examples of the many local traditional and recreational blackjack-like games include French/German Blackjack, called "Vingt-et-un" (French: Twenty-one) or "Siebzehn und Vier" (German: Seventeen and Four). The French/German game does not allow splitting. An ace can only count as eleven, but two aces count as a blackjack. It is mostly played in private circles and barracks. A British variation is called "Pontoon", the name being probably a corruption of "Vingt-et-un".

Blackjack is also featured in various television shows. Here are a few shows inspired by the game.


In 2002, professional gamblers around the world were invited to nominate great blackjack players for admission into the <a href="Blackjack%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Blackjack Hall of Fame</a>. Seven members were inducted in 2002, with new people inducted every year after. The Hall of Fame is at the <a href="Barona%20Casino">Barona Casino</a> in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>. Members include <a href="Edward%20O.%20Thorp">Edward O. Thorp</a>, author of the 1960s book "Beat the Dealer" which proved that the game could be beaten with a combination of basic strategy and <a href="card%20counting">card counting</a>; <a href="Ken%20Uston">Ken Uston</a>, who popularized the concept of team play; <a href="Arnold%20Snyder">Arnold Snyder</a>, author and editor of the "<a href="Blackjack%20Forum">Blackjack Forum</a>" trade journal; <a href="Stanford%20Wong">Stanford Wong</a>, author and popularizer of the "Wonging" technique of only playing at a positive count, and several others.

Novels have been written around blackjack and the possibility of winning games via some kind of method. Among these were "The Blackjack Hijack" (Charles Einstein, 1976), later produced as the TV movie <a href="Nowhere%20to%20Run%20%281978%20film%29">"Nowhere to Run"</a>, "Bringing Down the House" (Ben Mezrich), also filmed as <a href="21%20%281991%20film%29">"21"</a>, and a <a href="21%20%282008%20film%29">2008 remake</a>. An almost identical theme was shown in the 2004 Canadian film "The Last Casino".

Movies titled "21" or "Twenty One" depicting the blackjack game as a central theme have been produced and released in 1918 (starring <a href="Bryant%20Washburn">Bryant Washburn</a>) and in 1923 (starring <a href="Richard%20Barthelmess">Richard Barthelmess</a>). In "The Hangover", an American comedy, four friends try to count cards to win back enough money to secure the release of their friend from the clutches of a notorious criminal they stole from the previous night while blacked out. A central part of the plot of "<a href="Rain%20Man">Rain Man</a>" is that Raymond (<a href="Dustin%20Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>), an autistic <a href="savant%20syndrome">savant</a>, is able to win at blackjack by counting cards. In the 2014 film "<a href="The%20Gambler%20%282014%20film%29">The Gambler</a>" we see Jim Bennett (<a href="Mark%20Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a>) playing high stakes Blackjack in order to win large sums of money. This movie displays different blackjack lingo and risky moves that have high rewards.

The bicarbonate ion carries a negative one <a href="formal%20charge">formal charge</a> and is the <a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate base</a> of <a href="carbonic%20acid">carbonic acid</a> ; at the same time, it is the <a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate acid</a> of , the <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> ion, as shown by these <a href="chemical%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a> reactions:

A bicarbonate salt forms when a <a href="cation">positively charged ion</a> attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion, forming an <a href="ionic%20compound">ionic compound</a>. Many bicarbonates are <a href="solubility">soluble</a> in <a href="aqueous%20solution">water</a> at <a href="standard%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a>; in particular, sodium bicarbonate contributes to <a href="total%20dissolved%20solids">total dissolved solids</a>, a common parameter for assessing <a href="water%20quality">water quality</a>.

Bicarbonate () is <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a>, and a vital component of the <a href="pH">pH</a> <a href="Buffer%20solution">buffering system</a> of the human body (maintaining <a href="acid%E2%80%93base%20homeostasis">acid–base homeostasis</a>). 70–75% of CO in the body is converted into <a href="carbonic%20acid">carbonic acid</a> (HCO), which can quickly turn into bicarbonate.

With carbonic acid as the <a href="Reaction%20intermediate">central intermediate</a> <a href="Chemical%20species">species</a>, bicarbonate – in conjunction with water, <a href="hydronium">hydrogen ions</a>, and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> – forms this buffering system, which is maintained at the volatile equilibrium required to provide prompt resistance to pH changes in both the acidic and <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a> directions. This is especially important for protecting <a href="Tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> of the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>, where pH changes too far outside of the normal range in either direction could prove disastrous (see <a href="acidosis">acidosis</a> or <a href="alkalosis">alkalosis</a>).

Bicarbonate also acts to regulate pH in the small intestine. It is released from the <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a> in response to the hormone <a href="secretin">secretin</a> to neutralize the acidic <a href="chyme">chyme</a> entering the duodenum from the stomach.

Bicarbonate is the dominant form of <a href="Total%20inorganic%20carbon">dissolved inorganic carbon</a> in sea water, and in most fresh waters. As such it is an important sink in the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a>.

In freshwater ecology, strong <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> activity by freshwater plants in daylight releases gaseous <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> into the water and at the same time produces bicarbonate ions. These shift the pH upward until in certain circumstances the degree of alkalinity can become toxic to some organisms or can make other chemical constituents such as <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> toxic. In darkness, when no photosynthesis occurs, respiration processes release carbon dioxide, and no new bicarbonate ions are produced, resulting in a rapid fall in pH.

The most common salt of the bicarbonate ion is <a href="sodium%20bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a>, NaHCO, which is commonly known as <a href="baking%20soda">baking soda</a>. When heated or exposed to an <a href="acid">acid</a> such as <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> (<a href="vinegar">vinegar</a>), sodium bicarbonate releases <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. This is used as a <a href="leavening%20agent">leavening agent</a> in <a href="baking">baking</a>.

The flow of bicarbonate ions from rocks weathered by the carbonic acid in rainwater is an important part of the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a>.

Bicarbonate also serves much in the digestive system. It raises the internal pH of the stomach, after highly acidic digestive juices have finished in their digestion of food. <a href="Ammonium%20bicarbonate">Ammonium bicarbonate</a> is used in <a href="digestive%20biscuit">digestive biscuit</a> manufacture.

In <a href="diagnostic%20medicine">diagnostic medicine</a>, the <a href="blood%20value">blood value</a> of bicarbonate is one of several indicators of the state of <a href="acid%E2%80%93base%20physiology">acid–base physiology</a> in the body. It is measured, along with <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="chloride">chloride</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, and <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, to assess <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> levels in an <a href="electrolyte%20panel">electrolyte panel</a> test (which has <a href="Current%20Procedural%20Terminology">Current Procedural Terminology</a>, CPT, code 80051).

The parameter "standard bicarbonate concentration" (SBC) is the bicarbonate concentration in the blood at a <a href="PaCO2">PCO</a> of , full oxygen saturation and 36 °C.

Bernard Allan "Bernie" Federko (born May 12, 1956) is a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> retired professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="centre%20%28ice%20hockey%29">centre</a> of <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainian</a> ancestry who played fourteen seasons in the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> from <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20NHL%20season">1976</a> through <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20NHL%20season">1990</a>.

Federko began playing hockey at a young age in his home town of <a href="Foam%20Lake%2C%20Saskatchewan">Foam Lake, Saskatchewan</a>. He was captain of the 1971 Bantam provincial champions. He also played Senior hockey with the local <a href="Foam%20Lake%20Flyers">Foam Lake Flyers</a> of the Fishing Lake Hockey League, winning the league scoring title as a bantam-aged player. Federko continued his career with the <a href="Saskatoon%20Blades">Saskatoon Blades</a> of the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League">WHL</a> where he set and still holds the team record for assists. He played three seasons with the Blades, and in his final year with the club he led the league in assists and points in both the regular season "and" playoffs. As a reward, Federko was drafted 7th overall by the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> in the <a href="1976%20NHL%20Amateur%20Draft">1976 NHL Amateur Draft</a>. He started the next season with the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Blues%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Kansas City Blues</a> of the <a href="Central%20Hockey%20League%20%281963%E2%80%9384%29">Central Hockey League</a> and was leading the league in points when he was called up mid-season to play 31 games with St. Louis. He scored three <a href="hat%20trick">hat trick</a>s in those 31 games. In the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20NHL%20season">1978–79 NHL season</a>, Federko developed into a bona fide star, as he scored 95 points.

Federko scored 100 points in a season four times, and was a consistent and underrated performer for the Blues. Federko scored at least 90 points in seven of the eight seasons between 1978 and 1986, and became the first player in NHL history to record at least 50 assists in 10 consecutive seasons. However, in an era when <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> was scoring 200 points a season, Federko never got the attention many felt he deserved. In 1986, in a poll conducted by GOAL magazine, he was named the most overlooked talent in hockey. His <a href="General%20Manager">General Manager</a> <a href="Ron%20Caron">Ron Caron</a> said he was "A great playmaker. He makes the average or above average player look like a star at times. He's such an unselfish player."

On March 19, 1988, Federko became the 22nd NHL player to record 1000 career points. After a poor season for Federko in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NHL%20season">1988–89</a>, he was traded to the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> with <a href="Tony%20McKegney">Tony McKegney</a> for future Blues star <a href="Adam%20Oates">Adam Oates</a>, and <a href="Paul%20MacLean%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Paul MacLean</a>. In Detroit, Federko re-united with former Blues head coach <a href="Jacques%20Demers">Jacques Demers</a>, but he had to play behind <a href="Steve%20Yzerman">Steve Yzerman</a> and did not get his desired ice time. After his lowest point output since his rookie season, Federko decided to retire after the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20NHL%20season">1989–90 season</a>, having played exactly 1,000 NHL games.

Less than a year after retiring as a player, the Blues retired number 24 in his honor on March 16, 1991. Federko was eventually inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 2002. Currently, Federko is a television color commentator for <a href="Fox%20Sports%20Midwest">Fox Sports Midwest</a> during Blues broadcasts.

Buffalo, New York

Buffalo () is a city in and the <a href="county%20seat">seat</a> of <a href="Erie%20County%2C%20New%20York">Erie County</a> in <a href="Western%20New%20York">Western New York</a>. Located in the <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">U.S. state of New York</a> on the eastern shore of <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a> at the head of the <a href="Niagara%20River">Niagara River</a>. , Buffalo is the state's second most populous city after the <a href="New%20York%20City">city it is named for</a>, with 256,902 residents. The <a href="Buffalo-Niagara%20Falls%20metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a> has a population of 1.13 million, while the larger, cross-border <a href="Buffalo%20Niagara%20Region">Buffalo Niagara Region</a> includes 8 U.S. counties and 2 Canadian municipalities and has a population of 2,493,869.

Buffalo grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of the <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a>, railroads and Lake Erie, providing an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the <a href="midwestern%20United%20States">midwestern United States</a>, while grooming its economy for the grain, steel and automobile industries during the 20th century. After an economic downturn in the latter half of the 20th century, Buffalo's economy has transitioned to sectors that include financial services, technology, <a href="biomedical%20engineering">biomedical engineering</a> and education.

Buffalo is known as "The Queen City", "The Nickel City" and "The City of Good Neighbors". Its residents are called <a href="List%20of%20people%20from%20Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalonians</a>.

The city of Buffalo received its name from a nearby creek called <a href="Buffalo%20River%20%28New%20York%29">Buffalo Creek</a>. British military engineer Captain <a href="John%20Montresor">John Montresor</a> made reference to 'Buffalo Creek' in his journal of 1764, which may be the earliest recorded appearance of the name. There are several theories regarding how Buffalo Creek received its name. While it is possible that Buffalo Creek's name originated from French fur traders and Native Americans calling the creek "Beau Fleuve" (<a href="French%20language">French</a> for "Beautiful River"), it is also possible Buffalo Creek was named for the <a href="American%20bison">American buffalo</a>, whose historical range may have extended into <a href="western%20New%20York">western New York</a>.

During French exploration of the region in 1620, the region's inhabitants were an <a href="Iroquoian%20language">Iroquoian-speaking</a> tribal offshoot of the large <a href="Neutral%20Nation">Neutral Nation</a> called the <a href="Wenro%20people">Wenro people</a> or" 'Wenrohronon'," who lived along the south shore of <a href="Lake%20Ontario">Lake Ontario</a> and east end of Lake Erie and a bit of its southern shore. Later, during the 1640s–50s <a href="Beaver%20Wars">Beaver Wars</a>, the combined warriors of the <a href="Five%20Nations%20of%20the%20Iroquois">Five Nations of the Iroquois</a> Confederacy conquered the populous Neutrals and their peninsular territory, while the <a href="Seneca%20people">Senecas</a> alone took out the Wenro and their territory, c. 1651–1653.

In 1804, as principal agent opening the area for the <a href="Holland%20Land%20Company">Holland Land Company</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Ellicott">Joseph Ellicott</a>, the architect of Washington D.C., designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes similar to the street system he used in the nation's capital. Although Ellicott named the settlement "New Amsterdam," the name did not catch on.

During the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, on December 30, 1813, Buffalo was burned by British forces.

On October 26, 1825, the <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a> was completed with Buffalo a port-of-call for settlers heading westward. At the time, the population was about 2,400. The Erie Canal brought about a surge in population and commerce, which led Buffalo to incorporate as a city in 1832.

In 1845, construction began on the <a href="Macedonia%20Baptist%20Church%20%28Buffalo%2C%20New%20York%29">Macedonia Baptist Church</a>, an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement. Buffalo was a terminus point of the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> with many <a href="Fugitive%20slaves%20in%20the%20United%20States">fugitive slaves</a> crossing the <a href="Niagara%20River">Niagara River</a> to <a href="Fort%20Erie%2C%20Ontario">Fort Erie, Ontario</a> in search of freedom.

During the 1840s, Buffalo's port continued to develop. Both passenger and commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from the port of Buffalo. Grain and commercial goods shipments led to repeated expansion of the harbor. In 1843, the world's first steam-powered <a href="grain%20elevator">grain elevator</a> was constructed by local merchant <a href="Joseph%20Dart">Joseph Dart</a> and engineer <a href="Robert%20Dunbar">Robert Dunbar</a>. "<a href="Dart%27s%20Elevator">Dart's Elevator</a>" enabled faster unloading of <a href="lake%20freighter">lake freighter</a>s along with the transshipment of grain in bulk from barges, canal boats, and rail cars. By 1850, the city's population was 81,000.

At the dawn of the 20th century, local mills were among the first to benefit from <a href="hydroelectric%20power">hydroelectric power</a> generated by the Niagara River. The city got the nickname "City of Light" at this time due to the widespread electric lighting. It was also part of the automobile revolution, hosting the <a href="brass%20era">brass era</a> car builders <a href="Pierce%20Arrow">Pierce Arrow</a> and the Seven Little Buffaloes early in the century. President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> was <a href="William%20McKinley%20assassination">shot and mortally wounded</a> by an <a href="anarchist">anarchist</a> at the <a href="Pan-American%20Exposition">Pan-American Exposition</a> in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. McKinley died in the city eight days later and <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was sworn in at the <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20Inaugural%20National%20Historic%20Site">Wilcox Mansion</a> as the 26th President of the United States.

The Great Depression of 1929–39 saw severe unemployment, especially among working class men. The <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> relief programs operated full force. The city became a stronghold of labor unions and the Democratic Party. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Buffalo saw the return of prosperity and full employment due to its position as a manufacturing center.

With the opening of the <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20Seaway">St. Lawrence Seaway</a> in 1957, which cut the city off from valuable trade routes; deindustrialization; and the nationwide trend of suburbanization; the city's economy began to deteriorate. Like much of the <a href="Rust%20Belt">Rust Belt</a>, Buffalo, home to more than half a million people in the 1950s, has seen its population decline as heavy industries shut down and people left for the suburbs or other cities. During this time, <a href="urban%20renewal">urban renewal</a> and the construction of several expressways, including the <a href="Niagara%20Thruway">Niagara Thruway</a>, <a href="Scajaquada%20Expressway">Scajaquada Expressway</a> and <a href="Kensington%20Expressway">Kensington Expressway</a> reshaped much of the city, displacing residents and businesses.

Like other <a href="rust%20belt">rust belt</a> cities such as <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a> and <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a>, Buffalo has attempted to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. In the early 2010s, growth from local colleges and universities continued to spur economic development.

Buffalo is on <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>'s eastern end, opposite Fort Erie, Ontario. It is located at the origin of the Niagara River, which flows northward over <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a> and into <a href="Lake%20Ontario">Lake Ontario</a>. The city is south-southeast from <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. In the <a href="Southtowns">Southtowns</a> lie the Boston Hills, while the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> sit in the <a href="Southern%20Tier">Southern Tier</a> below them. To the north and east, the region maintains a flatter profile descending to Lake Ontario.

<a href="Buffalo%20River%20%28New%20York%29">Buffalo River</a> and <a href="Scajaquada%20Creek">Scajaquada Creek</a> run through the city.

According to the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city has a total area of , of which is land and the rest water. The total area is 22.66% water.

Buffalo's architecture is diverse, with a collection of buildings the 19th and 20th centuries. Most structures and works are still standing, such as the country's largest intact parks system designed by <a href="Frederick%20Law%20Olmsted">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> and <a href="Calvert%20Vaux">Calvert Vaux</a>. At the end of the 19th century, the <a href="Prudential%20%28Guaranty%29%20Building%20%28Buffalo%2C%20New%20York%29">Guaranty Building</a>—constructed by <a href="Louis%20Sullivan">Louis Sullivan</a>—was a prominent example of an early high-rise skyscraper. The 20th century saw works such as the <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>-style <a href="Buffalo%20City%20Hall">Buffalo City Hall</a> and <a href="Buffalo%20Central%20Terminal">Buffalo Central Terminal</a>, <a href="Electric%20Tower">Electric Tower</a>, the <a href="H.%20H.%20Richardson%20Complex">Richardson Olmsted Complex</a>, and the <a href="Rand%20Building">Rand Building</a>. <a href="Urban%20renewal">Urban renewal</a> from the 1950s–1970s gave way to the construction of the <a href="Brutalist%20architecture">Brutalist</a>-style <a href="Buffalo%20City%20Court%20Building">Buffalo City Court Building</a> and the <a href="One%20Seneca%20Tower">One Seneca Tower</a>—formerly the HSBC Center, the city's tallest building.

Buffalo has a <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">continental-type</a> climate, which is common in the Great Lakes region. (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Dfb" – uniform precipitation distribution). Buffalo has snowy winters, but it is rarely the <a href="Golden%20Snowball%20Award">snowiest city in New York state</a>. The <a href="Blizzard%20of%201977">Blizzard of 1977</a> resulted from a combination of high winds and snow previously accumulated on land and on frozen Lake Erie. Snow does not typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage during the autumn as with the <a href="Lake%20Storm%20%26quot%3BAphid%26quot%3B">October 2006 storm</a>. In November 2014, the region had a <a href="November%2013%E2%80%9321%2C%202014%20North%20American%20winter%20storm">record-breaking storm</a>, producing over of snow. Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeast</a>, but still has enough rain to keep vegetation green and lush. Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine and moderate <a href="humidity">humidity</a> and temperature. Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off Lake Erie in summer that gently temper the warmest days. As a result, temperatures only rise above three times per year, and the Buffalo station of the National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of or more. Rainfall is moderate but typically occurs at night. Lake Erie's stabilizing effect continues to inhibit <a href="thunderstorms">thunderstorms</a> and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July. August usually has more showers and is hotter and more humid as the warmer lake loses its temperature-stabilizing influence. The highest recorded temperature in Buffalo was on August 27, 1948 and the lowest recorded temperature was , which occurred twice, on February 9, 1934 and February 2, 1961.

Like most former industrial cities of the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region in the United States, Buffalo is recovering from an economic depression from suburbanization and the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States, and its population has been spreading out to the suburbs every census since then.

At the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 Census</a>, the city's population was 50.4% White (45.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 38.6% Black or African-American, 0.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 3.9% from some other race and 3.1% from two or more races. 10.5% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race. Since 2003, there has been an ever-growing number of <a href="Myanmar">Burmese</a> refugees, mostly of the <a href="Karen%20people">Karen</a> ethnicity, with an estimated 4,665 now residing in Buffalo.

The <a href="median%20household%20income">median income</a> for a household in the city is $24,536 and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The per capita income for the city is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.

The following is a list of the top ten private employers in the Buffalo area.
Buffalo's economic sectors include industrial, light manufacturing, high technology and services. The <a href="State%20of%20New%20York">State of New York</a>, with over 15,000 employees, is the city's largest employer. Other major employers include the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States government</a>, <a href="Kaleida%20Health">Kaleida Health</a>, <a href="M%26amp%3BT%20Bank">M&T Bank</a> (which is headquartered in Buffalo), the <a href="University%20at%20Buffalo">University at Buffalo</a>, <a href="Tonawanda%20Engine">General Motors</a>, <a href="Time%20Warner%20Cable">Time Warner Cable</a> and <a href="Tops%20Friendly%20Markets">Tops Friendly Markets</a>. Buffalo is home to <a href="Rich%20Products">Rich Products</a>, Canadian brewer <a href="Labatt">Labatt</a>, cheese company <a href="Sorrento%20Lactalis">Sorrento Lactalis</a>, <a href="Delaware%20North%20Companies">Delaware North Companies</a> and <a href="New%20Era%20Cap%20Company">New Era Cap Company</a>. More recently, the <a href="Tesla%20Inc.">Tesla</a> <a href="Gigafactory%202">Gigafactory 2</a> opened in South Buffalo in summer 2017, as a result of the <a href="Buffalo%20Billion">Buffalo Billion</a> program.

The loss of traditional jobs in manufacturing, rapid suburbanization and high labor costs have led to economic decline and made Buffalo one of the poorest U.S. cities with populations of more than 250,000 people. An estimated 28.7–29.9% of Buffalo residents live below the poverty line, behind either only Detroit, or only Detroit and Cleveland. Buffalo's median household income of $27,850 is third-lowest among large cities, behind only Miami and Cleveland; however the metropolitan area's median household income is $57,000. This, in part, has led to the <a href="Buffalo-Niagara%20Falls%20metropolitan%20area">Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area</a> having the most affordable housing market in the U.S. The quarterly NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) noted nearly 90% of the new and existing homes sold in the metropolitan area during the second quarter were affordable to families making the area's median income of $57,000. , the median home price in the city was $95,000.

Buffalo's economy has begun to see significant improvements since the early 2010s. Money from New York State Governor <a href="Andrew%20Cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a> through a program known locally as "<a href="Buffalo%20Billion">Buffalo Billion</a>" has brought new construction, increased economic development, and hundreds of new jobs to the area. As of March 2015, Buffalo's unemployment rate was 5.9%, slightly above the national average of 5.5%.

The Olmsted-designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and are maintained by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy (BOPC), a non-profit, for public benefit corporation which serves as the city's parks department. It is the first non-governmental organization of its kind to serve in such a capacity in the United States.

Situated at the confluence of Lake Erie and the Buffalo and Niagara rivers, Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of <a href="transshipment">transshipment</a>, manufacturing, and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade and industry. Beginning in 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront began to be transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. To this end, <a href="Buffalo%20Harbor%20State%20Park">Buffalo Harbor State Park</a>, nicknamed "Outer Harbor," was opened in 2014.

In a trend common to northern "<a href="Rust%20Belt">Rust Belt</a>" regions, the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> has dominated Buffalo's political life for the last half-century. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was <a href="Chester%20A.%20Kowal">Chester A. Kowal</a> in 1965. In 1977, Democratic Mayor <a href="James%20D.%20Griffin">James D.

Griffin switched political allegiances several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat <a href="Anthony%20M.%20Masiello">Anthony M. Masiello</a> (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on <a href="social%20conservatism">social conservatism</a>, often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances.

In 2013, the Conservative Party endorsed Brown for a third term because of his pledge to cut taxes. This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and on the edge of bankruptcy. At <a href="New%20York%20State%20Comptroller">New York State Comptroller</a> <a href="Alan%20Hevesi">Alan Hevesi</a>'s urging, the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority. Mayor Tony Masiello began conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government the following year, but they came to naught.

The <a href="Peace%20Bridge">Peace Bridge</a> is a major international crossing near the city's <a href="Black%20Rock%2C%20Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Black Rock</a> district, connecting Buffalo with Fort Erie and Toronto via the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Way">Queen Elizabeth Way</a>.

Buffalo's water system is operated by <a href="Veolia%20Water">Veolia Water</a>. To reduce large-scale ice blockage in the Niagara River, with resultant flooding, ice damage to docks and other waterfront structures, and blockage of the water intakes for the hydro-electric power plants at Niagara Falls, the <a href="New%20York%20Power%20Authority">New York Power Authority</a> and <a href="Ontario%20Power%20Generation">Ontario Power Generation</a> have jointly operated the Lake Erie-Niagara River Ice Boom since 1964. The boom is installed on December 16, or when the water temperature reaches , whichever happens first. The boom is opened on April 1 unless there is more than of ice remaining in Eastern Lake Erie. When in place, the boom stretches from the outer breakwall at Buffalo Harbor almost to the Canadian shore near the ruins of the pier at Erie Beach in Fort Erie. The boom was originally made of wooden timbers, but these have been replaced by steel pontoons.

Benjamin Franklin

Benjamin Franklin <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">FRS</a>, <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Edinburgh">FRSE</a> ( April 17, 1790) was one of the <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Founding Fathers of the United States</a>. Franklin was a renowned <a href="polymath">polymath</a> and a leading author, printer, <a href="List%20of%20political%20philosophers">political theorist</a>, politician, <a href="freemason">freemason</a>, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the <a href="American%20Enlightenment">American Enlightenment</a> and the <a href="history%20of%20physics">history of physics</a> for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the <a href="lightning%20rod">lightning rod</a>, <a href="bifocals">bifocals</a>, and the <a href="Franklin%20stove">Franklin stove</a>, among other inventions. He facilitated many civic organizations, including Philadelphia's fire department and the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, an <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> institution.

Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">colonial unity</a>, initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies. As the first <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20France">United States Ambassador to France</a>, he exemplified the emerging American nation. Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>. In the words of historian <a href="Henry%20Steele%20Commager">Henry Steele Commager</a>, "In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of <a href="Puritanism">Puritanism</a> without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat." To <a href="Walter%20Isaacson">Walter Isaacson</a>, this makes Franklin "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become."

Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, the leading city in the colonies, publishing the "<a href="Pennsylvania%20Gazette">Pennsylvania Gazette</a>" at the age of 23. He became wealthy publishing this and "<a href="Poor%20Richard%27s%20Almanack">Poor Richard's Almanack</a>", which he authored under the <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a> "Richard Saunders". After 1767, he was associated with the "<a href="Pennsylvania%20Chronicle">Pennsylvania Chronicle</a>", a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British policies.

He pioneered and was first president of <a href="Academy%20and%20College%20of%20Philadelphia">Academy and College of Philadelphia</a> which opened in 1751 and later became the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. He organized and was the first secretary of the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Society">American Philosophical Society</a> and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a> repeal the unpopular <a href="Stamp%20Act%201765">Stamp Act</a>. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive <a href="France%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">Franco-American relations</a>. His efforts proved vital for the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France.

He was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years, and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network. During the Revolution, he became the first <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">United States Postmaster General</a>. He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as <a href="Supreme%20Executive%20Council%20of%20the%20Commonwealth%20of%20Pennsylvania%23Presidents%20of%20Council">governor of Pennsylvania</a>. He initially owned and dealt in slaves but, by the 1750s, he argued against <a href="slavery">slavery</a> from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionists</a>.

His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">coinage</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20one%20hundred-dollar%20bill">$100 bill</a>, <a href="USS%20Benjamin%20Franklin%20%28SSBN-640%29">warships</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20places%20named%20for%20Benjamin%20Franklin">the names of many towns</a>, counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as countless <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20in%20popular%20culture">cultural references</a>.

Benjamin Franklin's father, <a href="Josiah%20Franklin">Josiah Franklin</a>, was a <a href="tallow">tallow</a> chandler, a soap-maker and a candle-maker. Josiah was born at <a href="Ecton%2C%20Northamptonshire">Ecton, Northamptonshire</a>, England on December 23, 1657, the son of Thomas Franklin, a blacksmith-farmer, and Jane White. Benjamin's mother, Abiah Folger, was born in <a href="Nantucket%2C%20Massachusetts">Nantucket, Massachusetts</a>, on August 15, 1667, to <a href="Peter%20Folger%20%28Nantucket%20settler%29">Peter Folger</a>, a miller and schoolteacher, and his wife, <a href="Mary%20Morrell%20Folger">Mary Morrell Folger</a>, a former <a href="indentured%20servant">indentured servant</a>. 

Josiah had seventeen children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and immigrated with her to <a href="Boston">Boston</a> in 1683; they had three children before immigrating, and four after. Following her death, Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689 in the <a href="Old%20South%20Meeting%20House">Old South Meeting House</a> by <a href="Samuel%20Willard">Samuel Willard</a>. Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin's fifteenth child and tenth and last son.

Benjamin's mother, Abiah, was born into a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> for <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">religious freedom</a>, when <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles I of England</a> began persecuting Puritans. They sailed for Boston in 1635. Her father was "the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America." As <a href="court%20clerk">clerk of the court</a>, he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy Penn family that owned the <a href="Province%20of%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania Colony</a>.

Benjamin Franklin was born on <a href="Milk%20Street">Milk Street</a>, in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Massachusetts</a>, on January 17, 1706, and <a href="Infant%20baptism">baptized</a> at Old South Meeting House. He was one of seventeen children born to <a href="Josiah%20Franklin">Josiah Franklin</a>, and one of ten born by Josiah's second wife, Abiah Folger; the daughter of <a href="Peter%20Foulger">Peter Foulger</a> and <a href="Mary%20Morrill">Mary Morrill</a>. Among Benjamin's siblings were his older brother <a href="James%20Franklin%20%28printer%29">James</a> and his younger sister <a href="Jane%20Mecom">Jane</a>.

Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy, but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended <a href="Boston%20Latin%20School">Boston Latin School</a> but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although "his parents talked of the church as a career" for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an <a href="apprenticeship">apprentice</a> to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James founded "<a href="The%20New-England%20Courant">The New-England Courant</a>", which was <a href="History%20of%20American%20newspapers">the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies</a>.

When denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of "<a href="Silence%20Dogood">Silence Dogood</a>", a middle-aged widow. Mrs. Dogood's letters were published, and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the "Courant"'s readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin was an advocate of free speech from an early age. When his brother was jailed for three weeks in 1722 for publishing material unflattering to the governor, young Franklin took over the newspaper and had Mrs. Dogood (quoting "<a href="Cato%27s%20Letters">Cato's Letters</a>") proclaim: "Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech." Franklin left his apprenticeship without his brother's permission, and in so doing became a <a href="fugitive%20from%20justice">fugitive</a>.

At age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived, he worked in several printer shops around town, but he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor <a href="Sir%20William%20Keith%2C%204th%20Baronet">Sir William Keith</a> to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper empty, Franklin worked as a <a href="typesetter">typesetter</a> in a printer's shop in what is now the <a href="St%20Bartholomew-the-Great">Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great</a> in the <a href="Smithfield%2C%20London">Smithfield</a> area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, a merchant who employed Franklin as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business.

In 1727, Benjamin Franklin, then 21, created the <a href="Junto%20%28club%29">Junto</a>, a group of "like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community." The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia. The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well, and which had become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain.

Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library initially assembled from their own books after Franklin wrote:

This did not suffice, however. Franklin conceived the idea of a <a href="subscription%20library">subscription library</a>, which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the <a href="Library%20Company%20of%20Philadelphia">Library Company of Philadelphia</a>: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, <a href="Louis%20Timothee">Louis Timothee</a>. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and <a href="Library%23Research%20library">research library</a>.

Upon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. In 1728, Franklin had set up a printing house in partnership with <a href="Hugh%20Meredith">Hugh Meredith</a>; the following year he became the publisher of a newspaper called "<a href="Pennsylvania%20Gazette">The Pennsylvania Gazette</a>". The "Gazette" gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect. But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'

In 1732, Ben Franklin published the first <a href="German%20language">German-language</a> newspaper in America – "Die Philadelphische Zeitung" – although it failed after only one year, because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market. Franklin printed Moravian religious books in German. Franklin often visited <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</a> staying at the <a href="Moravian%20Sun%20Inn">Moravian Sun Inn</a>. In a 1751 pamphlet on demographic growth and its implications for the colonies, he called the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Dutch">Pennsylvania Germans</a> "Palatine Boors" who could never acquire the "Complexion" of the English settlers and to "Blacks and Tawneys" as weakening the social structure of the colonies. Although Franklin apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.

Franklin saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.

When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two "wretched little" news sheets, <a href="Andrew%20Bradford">Andrew Bradford</a>'s "The American Weekly Mercury", and <a href="Samuel%20Keimer">Samuel Keimer</a>'s "Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette". This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from "Chambers's Universal Dictionary". Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the "Instructor" and made it "The Pennsylvania Gazette". The "Gazette" soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. The series of essays called "The Busy-Body", which he wrote for Bradford's "American Mercury" in 1729, followed the general <a href="Joseph%20Addison">Addisonian</a> form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as <a href="Isaac%20Bickerstaff">Isaac Bickerstaff</a> had been in the "Tatler". And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the "sowre Philosopher", is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, <a href="Samuel%20Keimer">Samuel Keimer</a>.

As time went on, Franklin depended less on his literary conventions, and more on his own native humor. In this there is a new spirit—not suggested to him by the fine breeding of <a href="Joseph%20Addison">Addison</a>, or the bitter irony of <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Swift</a>, or the stinging completeness of <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Pope</a>. The brilliant little pieces Franklin wrote for his "Pennsylvania Gazette" have an imperishable place in American literature.

The "Pennsylvania Gazette", like most other newspapers of the period, was often poorly printed. Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade. Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the "Gazette." His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal. On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature. Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution. Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them.

Franklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue. He began in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, in 1731. After the second editor died, his widow Elizabeth Timothy took over and made it a success, 1738–46. She was one of the colonial era's first woman printers. For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter who took over in 1746. The "Gazette" had a policy of impartiality in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Editor Peter Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias, and after 1765 increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain. However, Franklin's "Connecticut Gazette" (1755–68) proved unsuccessful.

In 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local <a href="Masonic%20lodge">Masonic lodge</a>. He became Grand Master in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania. That same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of <a href="James%20Anderson%20%28Freemason%29">James Anderson's</a> "<a href="Constitutions%20of%20the%20Free-Masons">Constitutions of the Free-Masons</a>". Franklin remained a Freemason for the rest of his life.

At age 17 in 1723, Franklin proposed to 15-year-old <a href="Deborah%20Read">Deborah Read</a> while a boarder in the Read home. At that time, Read's mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin, who was on his way to London at Governor <a href="Sir%20William%20Keith%2C%204th%20Baronet">Sir William Keith's</a> request, and also because of his financial instability. Her own husband had recently died, and she declined Franklin's request to marry her daughter.

While Franklin was in London, his trip was extended, and there were problems with Sir William's promises of support. Perhaps because of the circumstances of this delay, Deborah married a man named John Rodgers. This proved to be a regrettable decision. Rodgers shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> with her <a href="dowry">dowry</a>, leaving her behind. Rodgers's fate was unknown, and because of <a href="bigamy">bigamy</a> laws, Deborah was not free to remarry.

Franklin established a <a href="common-law%20marriage">common-law marriage</a> with Deborah Read on September 1, 1730. They took in Franklin's recently acknowledged young illegitimate son <a href="William%20Franklin">William</a> and raised him in their household. They had two children together. Their son, <a href="Francis%20Folger%20Franklin">Francis Folger Franklin</a>, was born in October 1732 and died of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> in 1736. Their daughter, <a href="Sarah%20Franklin%20Bache">Sarah "Sally" Franklin</a>, was born in 1743 and grew up to marry <a href="Richard%20Bache">Richard Bache</a>, have seven children, and look after her father in his old age.

Deborah's fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe, and another possible reason why they spent so much time apart is that he may have blamed her for preventing their son Francis from being vaccinated against the disease that subsequently killed him. Deborah wrote to him in November 1769 saying she was ill due to "dissatisfied distress" from his prolonged absence, but he did not return until his business was done. Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke in 1774, while Franklin was on an extended mission to England; he returned in 1775.

In 1730, 24-year-old Franklin publicly acknowledged the existence of his son William, who was deemed 'illegitimate' as he was born out of wedlock and raised him in his household. His mother's identity is unknown. He was educated in Philadelphia. Beginning at about age 30, William studied law in London in the early 1760s. He fathered an illegitimate son, <a href="William%20Temple%20Franklin">William Temple Franklin</a>, born February 22, 1762. The boy's mother was never identified, and he was placed in foster care. Franklin later that year married Elizabeth Downes, daughter of a <a href="plantation">planter</a> from <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>. After William passed the bar, his father helped him gain an appointment in 1763 as the last <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20New%20Jersey">Royal Governor</a> of New Jersey.

A <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a>, William and his father eventually broke relations over their differences about the American Revolutionary War. The elder Franklin could never accept William's position. Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, William was arrested at his home in <a href="Perth%20Amboy">Perth Amboy</a> at the <a href="Proprietary%20House">Proprietary House</a> and imprisoned for a time. The younger Franklin went to New York in 1782, which was still occupied by British troops. He became leader of the Board of Associated Loyalists — a quasi-military organization, headquartered in New York City. They initiated guerrilla forays into <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, southern <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, and <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> counties north of the city. When British troops evacuated from New York, William Franklin left with them and sailed to England. He settled in London, never to return to North America. In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain, "... Benjamin Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea (that they be given a general pardon). He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin."

In 1733, Franklin began to publish the noted "<a href="Poor%20Richard%27s%20Almanack">Poor Richard's Almanack</a>" (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. "Poor Richard's Proverbs", adages from this almanac, such as "A penny saved is twopence dear" (often misquoted as "A penny saved is a penny earned") and "Fish and visitors stink in three days", remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year—it became an institution. In 1741 Franklin began publishing "The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle for all the British Plantations in America", the first such monthly magazine of this type published in America.

In 1758, the year he ceased writing for the Almanack, he printed "Father Abraham's Sermon", also known as "<a href="The%20Way%20to%20Wealth">The Way to Wealth</a>". Franklin's <a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Benjamin%20Franklin">autobiography</a>, begun in 1771 but published after his death, has become one of the classics of the genre.

<a href="Daylight%20saving%20time">Daylight saving time</a> (DST) is often erroneously attributed to a 1784 satire that Franklin published <a href="anonymity">anonymously</a>. Modern DST was first proposed by <a href="George%20Vernon%20Hudson">George Vernon Hudson</a> in 1895.

Franklin was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the <a href="lightning%20rod">lightning rod</a>, <a href="glass%20harmonica">glass harmonica</a> (a glass instrument, not to be confused with the <a href="Harmonica">metal harmonica</a>), <a href="Franklin%20stove">Franklin stove</a>, <a href="bifocals">bifocal glasses</a> and the flexible <a href="urinary%20catheterization">urinary catheter</a>. Franklin never patented his inventions; in his <a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Benjamin%20Franklin">autobiography</a> he wrote, "... as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously."

Franklin started exploring the phenomenon of <a href="electricity">electricity</a> in 1746 when he saw some of <a href="Archibald%20Spencer">Archibald Spencer</a>'s lectures using static electricity for illustrations. Franklin proposed that "vitreous" and "resinous" electricity were not different types of "<a href="Aether%20theories">electrical fluid</a>" (as electricity was called then), but the same "fluid" under different pressures. (The same proposal was made independently that same year by <a href="William%20Watson%20%28scientist%29">William Watson</a>.) Franklin was the first to label them as <a href="electric%20charge">positive and negative</a> respectively, and he was the first to discover the principle of <a href="charge%20conservation">conservation of charge</a>. In 1748 he constructed a multiple plate capacitor, that he called an "electrical battery" (not to be confused with <a href="Alessandro%20Volta">Volta's</a> <a href="Voltaic%20pile">pile</a>) by placing eleven panes of glass sandwiched between lead plates, suspended with silk cords and connected by wires.

In recognition of his work with electricity, Franklin received the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>'s <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a> in 1753, and in 1756 he became one of the few 18th-century Americans elected as a Fellow of the Society. He received honorary degrees from <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a> and <a href="Yale">Yale</a> universities (his first). The <a href="centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second%20system%20of%20units">cgs</a> unit of electric charge has been named after him: one "franklin" (Fr) is equal to one <a href="statcoulomb">statcoulomb</a>.

Franklin advised Harvard University in its acquisition of new electrical laboratory apparatus after the complete loss of its original collection, in a fire which destroyed the original <a href="Harvard%20Hall">Harvard Hall</a> in 1764. The collection he assembled would later become part of the <a href="Harvard%20Collection%20of%20Historical%20Scientific%20Instruments">Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments</a>, now on public display in its <a href="Harvard%20Science%20Center">Science Center</a>.

In 1750, he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that <a href="lightning">lightning</a> is electricity by <a href="Kite%20experiment">flying a kite in a storm</a> that appeared capable of becoming a lightning storm. On May 10, 1752, <a href="Thomas-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Dalibard">Thomas-François Dalibard</a> of France conducted Franklin's experiment using a iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15 Franklin may possibly have conducted his well-known kite experiment <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Philadelphia%29">in Philadelphia</a>, successfully extracting sparks from a cloud. Franklin described the experiment in the "<a href="Pennsylvania%20Gazette">Pennsylvania Gazette</a>" in October 19, 1752, without mentioning that he himself had performed it. This account was read to the Royal Society on December 21 and printed as such in the "Philosophical Transactions". <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> published details in his 1767 "History and Present Status of Electricity". Franklin was careful to stand on an insulator, keeping dry under a roof to avoid the danger of <a href="electric%20shock">electric shock</a>. Others, such as Prof. <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Richmann">Georg Wilhelm Richmann</a> in <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, were indeed electrocuted during the months following Franklin's experiment.

In his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of <a href="ground%20%28electricity%29">electrical ground</a>. Franklin did not perform this experiment in the way that is often pictured in popular literature, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been dangerous. Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, showing that lightning was electrical. On October 19 in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote:

Franklin's electrical experiments led to his invention of the <a href="lightning%20rod">lightning rod</a>. He noted that conductors with a sharp rather than a smooth point could discharge silently, and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this could help protect buildings from lightning by attaching "upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground; ... Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!" Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.

Franklin had a major influence on the emerging science of <a href="demography">demography</a>, or population studies. <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> is noted for his rule of population growth and credited Franklin for discovering it. Kammen (1990) and Drake (2011) say Franklin's "<a href="Observations%20Concerning%20the%20Increase%20of%20Mankind%2C%20Peopling%20of%20Countries%2C%20etc.">Observations on the Increase of Mankind</a>" (1755) stands alongside <a href="Ezra%20Stiles">Ezra Stiles</a>' "Discourse on Christian Union" (1760) as the leading works of eighteenth-century Anglo-American demography; Drake credits Franklin's "wide readership and prophetic insight."

In the 1730s and 1740s, Franklin began taking notes on population growth, finding that the American population had the fastest growth rates on earth. Emphasizing that population growth depended on food supplies—a line of thought later developed by <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a>—Franklin emphasized the abundance of food and available farmland in America. He calculated that America's population was doubling every twenty years and would surpass that of England in a century. In 1751, he drafted "Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &c." Four years later, it was anonymously printed in Boston, and it was quickly reproduced in Britain, where it influenced the economists <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a> and later <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a>. Franklin's predictions alarmed British leaders who did not want to be surpassed by the colonies, so they became more willing to impose restrictions on the colonial economy.

Franklin was also a pioneer in the study of slave demography, as shown in his 1755 essay.

As deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic Ocean</a> circulation patterns. While in England in 1768, he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packet ships carrying mail several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>? The merchantmen had a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London, while the packets left from <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Cornwall">Falmouth</a> in Cornwall.

Franklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger, a <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a> whaler captain, who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current. The mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of . Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, by which it is still known today.

Franklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England, where it was completely ignored. Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786. The British edition of the chart, which was the original, was so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a <a href="Woods%20Hole%20Oceanographic%20Institution">Woods Hole oceanographer</a> and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale%20de%20France">Bibliothèque Nationale</a> in Paris in 1980. This find received front-page coverage in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>".

It took many years for British sea captains to adopt Franklin's advice on navigating the current; once they did, they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time. In 1853, the oceanographer and cartographer <a href="Matthew%20Fontaine%20Maury">Matthew Fontaine Maury</a> noted that while Franklin charted and codified the Gulf Stream, he did not discover it:

Franklin was, along with his contemporary <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>, the only major scientist who supported <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a>' <a href="wave%20theory%20of%20light">wave theory of light</a>, which was basically ignored by the rest of the <a href="scientific%20community">scientific community</a>. In the 18th century <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton's</a> <a href="corpuscular%20theory%20of%20light">corpuscular theory</a> was held to be true; only after <a href="Thomas%20Young%20%28scientist%29">Young's</a> well-known <a href="slit%20experiment">slit experiment</a> in 1803 were most scientists persuaded to believe Huygens' theory.

On October 21, 1743, according to popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a <a href="lunar%20eclipse">lunar eclipse</a>. Franklin was said to have noted that the <a href="prevailing%20winds">prevailing winds</a> were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, Franklin learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced <a href="meteorology">meteorology</a>.

After the Icelandic volcanic eruption of <a href="Laki">Laki</a> in 1783, and the subsequent harsh European winter of 1784, Franklin made observations connecting the causal nature of these two separate events. He wrote about them in a lecture series.

Though Benjamin Franklin has been most noted kite-wise with his lightning experiments, he has also been noted by many for his using kites to pull humans and ships across waterways. The <a href="George%20Pocock%20%28inventor%29">George Pocock</a> in the book "A TREATISE on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails" noted being inspired by Benjamin Franklin's traction of his body by kite power across a waterway. In his later years he suggested using the technique for pulling ships.

Franklin noted a principle of <a href="refrigeration">refrigeration</a> by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments. In 1758 on a warm day in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, England, Franklin and fellow scientist <a href="John%20Hadley%20%28chemist%29">John Hadley</a> experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury <a href="thermometer">thermometer</a> with <a href="diethyl%20ether">ether</a> and using <a href="bellows">bellows</a> to evaporate the ether. With each subsequent <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a>, the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching . Another thermometer showed that the room temperature was constant at . In his letter "<a href="Cooling%20by%20Evaporation">Cooling by Evaporation</a>", Franklin noted that, "One may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day."

According to <a href="Michael%20Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>, Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of ice are worth mentioning, although the law of the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes is not attributed to Franklin. However, as reported in 1836 by Prof. A. D. Bache of the University of Pennsylvania, the law of the effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non-conductors, for example, glass, could be attributed to Franklin. Franklin writes, "... A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct ..." and again, "... And water, though naturally a good conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into ice."

An aging Franklin accumulated all his oceanographic findings in "Maritime Observations", published by the Philosophical Society's "transactions" in 1786. It contained ideas for <a href="sea%20anchor">sea anchor</a>s, <a href="catamaran">catamaran</a> hulls, <a href="watertight%20compartment">watertight compartment</a>s, shipboard lightning rods and a soup bowl designed to stay stable in stormy weather.

In a 1772 letter to <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a>, Franklin lays out the earliest known description of the Pro & Con list, a common <a href="decision-making">decision-making</a> technique, now sometimes called a <a href="decisional%20balance%20sheet">decisional balance sheet</a>:

... my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one "Pro", and over the other "Con". Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the different Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different Times occur to me for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason "pro" equal to some two Reasons "con", I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons "con" equal to some three Reasons "pro", I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.

While traveling on a ship, Franklin had observed that the wake of a ship was diminished when the cooks scuttled their greasy water. He studied the effects on a large pond in <a href="Clapham%20Common">Clapham Common</a>, London. "I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropt a little of it on the water ... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square." He later used the trick to "calm the waters" by carrying "a little oil in the hollow joint of my cane".

Franklin is known to have played the violin, the <a href="harp">harp</a>, and the guitar. He also composed music, notably a <a href="string%20quartet">string quartet</a> in <a href="classical%20period%20%28music%29">early classical style</a>. He developed a much-improved version of the <a href="glass%20harmonica">glass harmonica</a>, in which the glasses rotate on a shaft, with the player's fingers held steady, instead of the other way around; this version soon found its way to Europe.

Franklin was an avid <a href="chess">chess</a> player. He was playing chess by around 1733, making him the first chess player known by name in the American colonies. His essay on "<a href="The%20Morals%20of%20Chess">The Morals of Chess</a>" in "Columbian" magazine in December 1786 is the second known writing on chess in America. This essay in praise of chess and prescribing a code of behavior for the game has been widely reprinted and translated. He and a friend also used chess as a means of learning the <a href="Italian%20language">Italian language</a>, which both were studying; the winner of each game between them had the right to assign a task, such as parts of the Italian grammar to be learned by heart, to be performed by the loser before their next meeting.

Franklin was able to play chess more frequently against stronger opposition during his many years as a civil servant and diplomat in England, where the game was far better established than in America. He was able to improve his playing standard by facing more experienced players during this period. He regularly attended <a href="Old%20Slaughter%27s%20Coffee%20House">Old Slaughter's Coffee House</a> in London for chess and socializing, making many important personal contacts. While in Paris, both as a visitor and later as ambassador, he visited the famous <a href="Caf%C3%A9%20de%20la%20R%C3%A9gence">Café de la Régence</a>, which France's strongest players made their regular meeting place. No records of his games have survived, so it is not possible to ascertain his playing strength in modern terms.

Franklin was inducted into the <a href="World%20Chess%20Hall%20of%20Fame">U.S. Chess Hall of Fame</a> in 1999. The Franklin Mercantile Chess Club in Philadelphia, the second oldest chess club in the U.S., is named in his honor.

In 1736, Franklin created the <a href="Union%20Fire%20Company">Union Fire Company</a>, one of the first <a href="Volunteer%20fire%20department">volunteer firefighting companies</a> in America. In the same year, he printed a new currency for <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> based on innovative anti-<a href="counterfeit">counterfeit</a>ing techniques he had devised. Throughout his career, Franklin was an advocate for <a href="Banknote">paper money</a>, publishing "A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency" in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped <a href="deflation">deflation</a> without causing excessive inflation. In 1766 he made a case for paper money to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British House of Commons</a>.

As he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he first devised a scheme for <a href="The%20Academy%20and%20College%20of%20Philadelphia">The Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia</a>. However, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. <a href="Richard%20Peters%20%28cleric%29">Richard Peters</a>, refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749, when he printed his own pamphlet, "Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania." He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the Academy and the Charity School opened on August 13, 1751.

In 1743, Franklin founded the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Society">American Philosophical Society</a> to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.

In 1747, Franklin (already a very wealthy man) retired from printing and went into other businesses. He created a partnership with his foreman, <a href="David%20Hall%20%28publisher%29">David Hall</a>, which provided Franklin with half of the shop's profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with educated persons throughout Europe and especially in France.

Franklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman, in June 1749 he became a <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> for Philadelphia, and in 1751 he was elected to the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Provincial%20Assembly">Pennsylvania Assembly</a>. On August 10, 1753, Franklin was appointed deputy postmaster-general of <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a>, (<a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%23Postmaster">see below</a>). His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, with mail sent out every week.
In 1751, Franklin and <a href="Thomas%20Bond%20%28physician%29">Dr. Thomas Bond</a> obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. <a href="Pennsylvania%20Hospital">Pennsylvania Hospital</a> was the first hospital in what was to become the United States of America.

Between 1750 and 1753, the "educational triumvirate" of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the American <a href="Samuel%20Johnson%20%28American%20educator%29">Dr. Samuel Johnson</a> of <a href="Stratford%2C%20Connecticut">Stratford, Connecticut</a>, and the immigrant Scottish schoolteacher <a href="William%20Smith%20%28Episcopalian%20priest%29">Dr. William Smith</a> built on Franklin's initial scheme and created what <a href="James%20Madison%20%28bishop%29">Bishop James Madison</a>, president of the <a href="College%20of%20William%20%26amp%3B%20Mary">College of William & Mary</a>, called a "new-model" plan or style of American college. Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of <a href="ethics">moral philosophy</a> from the American <a href="Samuel%20Johnson%20%28American%20educator%29">Dr. Samuel Johnson</a> titled "Elementa Philosophica" to be taught in the new colleges to replace courses in denominational divinity.

In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford. They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission. Johnson went on to found King's College (now <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as Provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> and one as <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a>. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. The College was to become influential in guiding : in the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a>, for example, over one third of the college-affiliated men who contributed the "<a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>" between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the College.

In 1753, both <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a> and <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> awarded him honorary degrees.

In 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the <a href="Albany%20Congress">Albany Congress</a>. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad <a href="Albany%20Plan">Plan of Union</a> for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>.
In 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia (see "Associated Regiment of Philadelphia" under heading of Pennsylvania's 103rd Artillery and <a href="111th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">111th Infantry Regiment</a> at <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>). He used <a href="Tun%20Tavern">Tun Tavern</a> as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> uprisings that beset the American colonies. Reportedly Franklin was elected "Colonel" of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor.

From the mid 1750s to the mid 1770s, Franklin spent much of his time in London. Officially he was there on a political mission, but he used his time to further his scientific explorations as well, meeting many notable people.

In 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the <a href="Penn%20family">Penn family</a>, the <a href="proprietary%20colony">proprietors of the colony</a>. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> led to the failure of this mission.

At this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Pennsylvania%23Proprietors">William Penn's heirs</a>, who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the "anti-proprietary party" in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Pennsylvania%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the Pennsylvania House</a> in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship. During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission.

In London, Franklin opposed the <a href="Stamp%20Act%201765">1765 Stamp Act</a>. Unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and he testified during the House of Commons proceedings that led to its repeal.

With this, Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies. <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.

Franklin lodged in a house in Craven Street, just off <a href="Strand%2C%20London">The Strand</a> in <a href="central%20London">central London</a>. During his stays there, he developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson, and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly. Their house, which he used on various lengthy missions from 1757 to 1775, is the only one of his residences to survive. It opened to the public as the <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20House">Benjamin Franklin House</a> museum in 2006.

Whilst in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics. He belonged to a <a href="gentleman%27s%20club">gentleman's club</a> (which he called "the honest Whigs"), which held stated meetings, and included members such as <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price</a>, the minister of <a href="Newington%20Green%20Unitarian%20Church">Newington Green Unitarian Church</a> who ignited the <a href="Revolution%20Controversy">Revolution Controversy</a>, and <a href="Andrew%20Kippis">Andrew Kippis</a>.

In 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce (now the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> or RSA), which had been founded in 1754 and whose early meetings took place in <a href="English%20coffeehouses%20in%20the%2017th%20and%2018th%20centuries">Covent Garden coffee shops</a>. After his return to the United States in 1775, Franklin became the Society's Corresponding Member, continuing a close connection. The RSA instituted a <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Medal%20%28Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts%29">Benjamin Franklin Medal</a> in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.

The study of <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a> (what we would call science) drew him into overlapping circles of acquaintance. Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the <a href="Lunar%20Society%20of%20Birmingham">Lunar Society of Birmingham</a>, which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a>, <a href="James%20Watt">James Watt</a>, <a href="Josiah%20Wedgwood">Josiah Wedgwood</a> and <a href="Erasmus%20Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a>; on occasion he visited them.

In 1759, the <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> awarded Franklin an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> in recognition of his accomplishments. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> in 1762. Because of these honors, Franklin was often addressed as "Dr. Franklin."

Franklin also managed to secure an appointed post for his illegitimate son, <a href="William%20Franklin">William Franklin</a>, by then an attorney, as <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">Colonial Governor of New Jersey</a>.

While living in London in 1768, <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%27s%20phonetic%20alphabet">he developed a phonetic alphabet</a> in "A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling". This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. His new alphabet, however, never caught on, and he eventually lost interest.

Franklin used London as a base to travel. In 1771, he made short journeys through different parts of England, staying with <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> at <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Percival">Thomas Percival</a> at <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> and <a href="Erasmus%20Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a> at <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>.

In Scotland, he spent five days with <a href="Henry%20Home%2C%20Lord%20Kames">Lord Kames</a> near <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a> and stayed for three weeks with <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a> in Edinburgh. In 1759, he visited <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> with his son, and recalled his conversations there as "the "densest" happiness of my life". In February 1759, the <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree. From then he was known as "Doctor Franklin". In October of the same year he was granted <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freedom of the Borough</a> of <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a>.

He had never been to Ireland before, and met and stayed with <a href="Wills%20Hill%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Downshire">Lord Hillsborough</a>, who he believed was especially attentive. Franklin noted of him that "all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides." In <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Irish Parliament</a> rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor. While touring Ireland, he was moved by the level of poverty he saw. Ireland's economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of Britain that governed America. Franklin feared that America could suffer the same effects should Britain's "colonial exploitation" continue.

Franklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist <a href="Otto%20von%20Guericke">Otto von Guericke</a> for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amity%20and%20Commerce%20%28Prussia%E2%80%93United%20States%29">treaty of friendship</a> between Prussia and America in 1785.

In September 1767, Franklin visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, <a href="John%20Pringle">Sir John Pringle</a>. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to <a href="Louis%20XV%20of%20France">King Louis XV</a>.

One line of argument in Parliament was that Americans should pay a share of the costs of the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, and that therefore taxes should be levied on them. Franklin became the American spokesman in highly publicized testimony in Parliament in 1766. He stated that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said local governments had raised, outfitted and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> alone.

In 1773, Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: , and "An Edict by the King of Prussia".

In June 1773 Franklin obtained private letters of <a href="Thomas%20Hutchinson%20%28governor%29">Thomas Hutchinson</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Oliver">Andrew Oliver</a>, governor and lieutenant governor of the <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a>, that proved they were encouraging the Crown to crack down on Bostonians. Franklin sent them to America, where they escalated the tensions. The letters were finally <a href="News%20leak">leaked</a> to the public in the "<a href="Boston%20Gazette">Boston Gazette</a>" in mid-June 1773, causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England. The British began to regard him as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by <a href="Solicitor%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Solicitor-General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Wedderburn%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Rosslyn">Alexander Wedderburn</a>, before the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> on January 29, 1774. He returned to Philadelphia in March 1775, and abandoned his accommodationist stance.

In 1763, soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania from England for the first time, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as <a href="Pontiac%27s%20Rebellion">Pontiac's Rebellion</a>. The <a href="Paxton%20Boys">Paxton Boys</a>, a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indian</a> raids, murdered a group of peaceful <a href="Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a> Indians and marched on Philadelphia. Franklin helped to organize a local <a href="militia">militia</a> to defend the capital against the mob. He met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the <a href="racism">racial prejudice</a> of the Paxton Boys. "If an "Indian" injures me", he asked, "does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all "Indians"?"

He provided an early response to British surveillance through his own network of <a href="Surveillance%20art">counter-surveillance and manipulation</a>. "He waged a public relations campaign, secured secret aid, played a role in privateering expeditions, and churned out effective and inflammatory propaganda."

By the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, after his second mission to Great Britain, the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> had begun – with fighting between colonials and British at <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Lexington and Concord</a>. The New England militia had trapped the main British army in Boston. The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a>. In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the <a href="Committee%20of%20Five">Committee of Five</a> that drafted the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>. Although he was temporarily disabled by <a href="gout">gout</a> and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several "small but important" changes to the draft sent to him by <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>.

At the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by <a href="John%20Hancock">Hancock</a> that they must all hang together: "Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."

Well known as a printer and publisher, Franklin was appointed postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, holding the office until 1753, when he and publisher <a href="William%20Hunter%20%28publisher%29">William Hunter</a> were named deputy postmasters–general of British North America, the first to hold the office. (<a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Two%20Postmasters%20General">Joint appointments</a> were standard at the time, for political reasons.) Franklin was responsible for the British colonies as far as the <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">island of Newfoundland</a>, opening Canada's first post office at <a href="Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, while Hunter became postal administrator in <a href="Colonial%20Williamsburg">Williamsburg</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and oversaw areas south of <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. Franklin reorganized the service's accounting system, then improved speed of delivery between Philadelphia, New York and Boston. By 1761, efficiencies led to the first profits for the colonial post office.

When the lands of <a href="New%20France">New France</a> were ceded to the British under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1763, the new British <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763%E2%80%9391%29">province of Quebec</a> was created among them, and Franklin saw mail service expanded between <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res">Trois-Rivières</a>, <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>, and New York. For the greater part of his appointment, Franklin lived in England (from 1757 to 1762, and again from 1764 to 1774) – about three-quarters of his term. Eventually, his sympathies for the rebel cause in the American Revolution led to his dismissal on January 31, 1774.

On July 26, 1775, the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> established the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Post Office</a> and named Benjamin Franklin as the first <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">United States Postmaster General</a>. Franklin had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position. He had just returned from England and was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system. The report of the Committee, providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies, was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26. On July 26, 1775, Franklin was appointed Postmaster General, the first appointed under the Continental Congress. It established a postal system that became the United States Post Office, a system that continues to operate today.

In December 1776, Franklin was dispatched to France as <a href="commissioner">commissioner</a> for the United States. He took with him as secretary his 16-year-old grandson, <a href="William%20Temple%20Franklin">William Temple Franklin</a>. They lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of <a href="Passy">Passy</a>, donated by <a href="Jacques-Donatien%20Le%20Ray%20de%20Chaumont">Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont</a>, who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785. He conducted the affairs of his country toward the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and negotiating the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris (1783)</a>.

Among his associates in France was <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20Gabriel%20Riqueti%2C%20comte%20de%20Mirabeau">Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau</a>—a French Revolutionary writer, orator and statesman who in early 1791 would be elected president of the <a href="National%20Constituent%20Assembly%20%28France%29">National Assembly</a>. In July 1784, Franklin met with Mirabeau and contributed anonymous materials that the Frenchman used in his first signed work: "Considerations sur l'ordre de Cincinnatus". The publication was critical of the <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati">Society of the Cincinnati</a>, established in the United States. Franklin and Mirabeau thought of it as a "noble order", inconsistent with the <a href="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> ideals of the new republic.

During his stay in France, Benjamin Franklin was active as a <a href="freemasonry">Freemason</a>, serving as Venerable Master of the Lodge <a href="Les%20Neuf%20S%C5%93urs">Les Neuf Sœurs</a> from 1779 until 1781. He was the 106th member of the Lodge. In 1784, when <a href="Franz%20Mesmer">Franz Mesmer</a> began to publicize his theory of "<a href="animal%20magnetism">animal magnetism</a>" which was considered offensive by many, <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a> appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>, the physician <a href="Joseph-Ignace%20Guillotin">Joseph-Ignace Guillotin</a>, the astronomer <a href="Jean%20Sylvain%20Bailly">Jean Sylvain Bailly</a>, and Benjamin Franklin. In 1781, he was elected a Fellow of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>.

Franklin's advocacy for religious tolerance in France contributed to arguments made by French philosophers and politicians that resulted in <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a>'s signing of the <a href="Edict%20of%20Versailles">Edict of Versailles</a> in November 1787. This edict effectively nullified the <a href="Edict%20of%20Fontainebleau">Edict of Fontainebleau</a>, which had denied non-Catholics civil status and the right to openly practice their faith.

Franklin also served as American minister to Sweden, although he never visited that country. He negotiated a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amity%20and%20Commerce%20%28United%20States%E2%80%93Sweden%29">treaty</a> that was signed in April 1783. On August 27, 1783, in Paris, Franklin witnessed the world's first hydrogen <a href="balloon%20%28aircraft%29">balloon</a> flight. "<a href="Robert%20brothers%23First%20hydrogen%20balloon">Le Globe</a>", created by professor <a href="Jacques%20Charles">Jacques Charles</a> and <a href="Robert%20brothers">Les Frères Robert</a>, was watched by a vast crowd as it rose from the <a href="Champ%20de%20Mars">Champ de Mars</a> (now the site of the <a href="Eiffel%20Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>). This so enthused Franklin that he subscribed financially to the next project to build a manned hydrogen balloon. On December 1, 1783, Franklin was seated in the special enclosure for honoured guests when "<a href="Robert%20brothers%23First%20manned%20hydrogen%20balloon%20flight">La Charlière</a>" took off from the <a href="Jardin%20des%20Tuileries">Jardin des Tuileries</a>, piloted by Jacques Charles and <a href="Robert%20brothers">Nicolas-Louis Robert</a>.

When he returned home in 1785, Franklin occupied a position only second to that of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> as the champion of American independence. Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by <a href="Joseph%20Duplessis">Joseph Duplessis</a>, which now hangs in the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28United%20States%29">National Portrait Gallery</a> of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> in Washington, D.C. After his return, Franklin became an <a href="abolitionism">abolitionist</a> and freed his two slaves. He eventually became president of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Abolition%20Society">Pennsylvania Abolition Society</a>.

In 1787, Franklin served as a delegate to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Convention">Philadelphia Convention</a>. He held an honorary position and seldom engaged in debate. He is the only Founding Father who is a signatory of all four of the major documents of the founding of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">Treaty of Alliance</a> with France, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.

In 1787, a group of prominent ministers in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster, Pennsylvania</a>, proposed the foundation of a new college named in Franklin's honor. Franklin donated £200 towards the development of Franklin College (now called <a href="Franklin%20%26amp%3B%20Marshall%20College">Franklin & Marshall College</a>).

Between 1771 and 1788, he finished his <a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Benjamin%20Franklin">autobiography</a>. While it was at first addressed to his son, it was later completed for the benefit of mankind at the request of a friend.

Franklin strongly supported the right to <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>:

In those wretched countries where a man cannot call his tongue his own, he can scarce call anything his own. Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech ...

Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom, and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech, which is the right of every man ...

Special balloting conducted October 18, 1785, unanimously elected Franklin the sixth <a href="Supreme%20Executive%20Council%20of%20the%20Commonwealth%20of%20Pennsylvania%23Presidents%20of%20Council">president</a> of the <a href="Supreme%20Executive%20Council%20of%20the%20Commonwealth%20of%20Pennsylvania">Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania</a>, replacing <a href="John%20Dickinson%20%28Pennsylvania%20and%20Delaware%29">John Dickinson</a>. The office was practically that of <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Pennsylvania">governor</a>. Franklin held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election he was reelected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. In that capacity he served as host to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia.

Like the other advocates of <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republicanism</a>, Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous. All his life he explored the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in "Poor Richard's" <a href="aphorism">aphorism</a>s. Franklin felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men, but rarely attended religious services himself. When Franklin met <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> in Paris and asked his fellow member of the Enlightenment vanguard to bless his grandson, Voltaire said in English, "God and Liberty", and added, "this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin."

Franklin's parents were both pious <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>s. The family attended the <a href="Old%20South%20Church">Old South Church</a>, the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706. Franklin's father, a poor <a href="chandlery">chandler</a>, owned a copy of a book, "Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good", by the Puritan preacher and family friend <a href="Cotton%20Mather">Cotton Mather</a>, which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life. Franklin's first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a widely known sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather, but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.

Franklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728. It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas as regards belief in salvation, the <a href="divinity%20of%20Jesus">divinity of Jesus</a>, and indeed most religious dogma. He clarified himself as a <a href="Deism">deist</a> in his 1771 autobiography, although he still considered himself a Christian. He retained a strong faith in a God as the wellspring of morality and goodness in man, and as a Providential actor in history responsible for American independence.

It was Ben Franklin who, at a critical impasse during the <a href="Philadelphia%20Convention">Constitutional Convention</a> in June 1787, attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words:

... In the beginning of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. – Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor. ... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth – that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that "except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it." I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel: ... I therefore beg leave to move – that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.
However, the motion met with resistance and was never brought to a vote.

Franklin was an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical minister <a href="George%20Whitefield">George Whitefield</a> during the <a href="First%20Great%20Awakening">First Great Awakening</a>. Franklin did not subscribe to Whitefield's theology, but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works. Franklin published all of Whitefield's sermons and journals, thereby earning a lot of money and boosting the Great Awakening.

When he stopped attending church, Franklin wrote in his autobiography:
... Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.
Franklin retained a lifelong commitment to the Puritan virtues and political values he had grown up with, and through his civic work and publishing, he succeeded in passing these values into the American culture permanently. He had a "passion for virtue". These Puritan values included his devotion to egalitarianism, education, industry, thrift, honesty, temperance, charity and community spirit.

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">ideal of republican government</a> based on hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that English liberties relied on their balance of power, but also hierarchal deference to the privileged class. "Puritanism ... and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification" by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all men can be saved. Franklin, steeped in Puritanism and an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical movement, rejected the salvation dogma, but embraced the radical notion of egalitarian democracy.

Franklin's commitment to teach these values was itself something he gained from his Puritan upbringing, with its stress on "inculcating virtue and character in themselves and their communities." These Puritan values and the desire to pass them on, were one of Franklin's quintessentially American characteristics, and helped shape the character of the nation. Franklin's writings on <a href="virtue">virtue</a> were derided by some European authors, such as Jackob Fugger in his critical work "Portrait of American Culture". <a href="Max%20Weber">Max Weber</a> considered Franklin's ethical writings a culmination of the <a href="Protestant%20work%20ethic">Protestant ethic</a>, which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>.

One of Franklin's notable characteristics was his respect, tolerance and promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, he wrote in <a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Benjamin%20Franklin">his autobiography</a>, "new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused." "He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism." The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Franklin's friend and preacher, George Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, "claiming liberty of conscience to be an 'inalienable right of every rational creature.'" Whitefield's supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected "a large, new hall, that ... could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief." Franklin's rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and <a href="civic%20virtue">civic virtue</a> made him the "prophet of tolerance." Franklin composed "A Parable Against Persecution", an apocryphal 51st chapter of Genesis in which God teaches Abraham the duty of tolerance. While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of <a href="General%20Assembly%20of%20Unitarian%20and%20Free%20Christian%20Churches">British Unitarianism</a>, attending the inaugural session of the <a href="Essex%20Street%20Chapel">Essex Street Chapel</a>, at which <a href="Theophilus%20Lindsey">Theophilus Lindsey</a> drew together the first avowedly <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky, and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> was illegal until <a href="Doctrine%20of%20the%20Trinity%20Act%201813">the 1813 Act</a>.

Although Franklin's parents had intended for him to have a career in the Church, Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in <a href="deism">deism</a>, that God's truths can be found entirely through nature and reason. "I soon became a thorough Deist." As a young man he rejected Christian dogma in a 1725 pamphlet "<a href="A%20Dissertation%20on%20Liberty%20and%20Necessity%2C%20Pleasure%20and%20Pain">A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain</a>", which he later saw as an embarrassment, while simultaneously asserting that God is "all wise, <a href="Omnibenevolence">all good</a>, <a href="Omnipotence">all powerful</a>." He defended his rejection of religious dogma with these words: "I think opinions should be judged by their influences and effects; and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious, it may be concluded that he holds none that are dangerous, which I hope is the case with me." After the disillusioning experience of seeing the decay in his own moral standards, and those of two friends in London whom he had converted to Deism, Franklin turned back to a belief in the importance of organized religion, on the pragmatic grounds that without God and organized churches, man will not be good. Moreover, because of his proposal that <a href="Christian%20prayer">prayers</a> be said in the <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20of%201787">Constitutional Convention of 1787</a>, many have contended that in his later life Franklin became a <a href="piety">pious</a> Christian.
According to David Morgan, Franklin was a proponent of religion in general. He prayed to "Powerful Goodness" and referred to God as "the infinite". <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: "The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a> thought him almost a Catholic. The <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> claimed him as one of them. The <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterians</a> thought him half a Presbyterian, and the <a href="Quakers">Friends</a> believed him a wet Quaker." Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, "he was a true champion of generic religion." In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin stated that he believed that religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming, "When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig'd to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one."

In 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to <a href="Ezra%20Stiles">Ezra Stiles</a>, president of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, who had asked him his views on religion:

On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed a three-member committee composed of Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams to design the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20United%20States">Great Seal of the United States</a>. Franklin's proposal (which was not adopted) featured the motto: "Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God" and a scene from the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a>, with <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a>, the <a href="Pillar%20of%20Fire%20%28theophany%29">pillar of fire</a>, and <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> depicted as <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>. The design that was produced was never acted upon by Congress, and the Great Seal's design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782.

Franklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of 13 virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His <a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Benjamin%20Franklin">autobiography</a> lists his 13 virtues as:


Franklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week "leaving all others to their ordinary chance." While Franklin did not live completely by his virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography Franklin wrote, "I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit."

When Franklin was young, <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">African slavery</a> was common and virtually unchallenged throughout the British colonies. During his lifetime slaves were numerous in Philadelphia. In 1750, half the persons in Philadelphia who had established probate estates owned slaves. Dock workers in the city consisted of 15% slaves. Franklin owned as many as seven slaves, two males who worked in his household and his shop. Franklin posted paid ads for the sale of slaves and for the capture of runaway slaves and allowed the sale of slaves in his general store. Franklin profited from both the international and domestic slave trade, even criticizing slaves who had run off to join the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> during the colonial wars of the 1740s and 1750s. Franklin, however, later became a "cautious abolitionist" and became an outspoken critic of landed gentry slavery. In 1758, Franklin advocated the opening of a school for the education of black slaves in Philadelphia. After returning from England in 1762, Franklin became more anti-slavery, in his view believing that the institution promoted black degradation rather than the idea blacks were inherently inferior. By 1770, Franklin had freed his slaves and attacked the system of slavery and the <a href="international%20slave%20trade">international slave trade</a>. Franklin, however, refused to publicly debate the issue of slavery at the <a href="1787%20Constitutional%20Convention">1787 Constitutional Convention</a>. Franklin tended to take both sides of the issue of slavery, never fully divesting himself from the institution.

In his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of slavery, Franklin wrote several essays that stressed the importance of the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolition of slavery</a> and of the integration of blacks into American society. These writings included:

In 1790, <a href="Quakers">Quakers</a> from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition to Congress. Their argument against slavery was backed by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Abolitionist%20Society">Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society</a> and its president, Benjamin Franklin.

Franklin suffered from <a href="obesity">obesity</a> throughout his middle-aged and later years, which resulted in multiple health problems, particularly <a href="gout">gout</a>, which worsened as he aged. In poor health during the signing of the US Constitution in 1787, he was rarely seen in public from then until his death.

Benjamin Franklin died from <a href="Pleurisy">pleuritic attack</a> at his home in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790, at age 84. His death is described in the book "The Life of Benjamin Franklin", quoting from the account of Dr. John Jones:

... when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.
Approximately 20,000 people attended his funeral. He was interred in <a href="Christ%20Church%20Burial%20Ground">Christ Church Burial Ground</a> in Philadelphia. In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

The Body of B. Franklin Printer; Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost: For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new & more perfect Edition, Corrected and Amended By the Author.

Franklin's actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads "Benjamin and Deborah Franklin".

A signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, Franklin is considered one of the <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Founding Fathers of the United States</a>. His pervasive influence in the early history of the nation has led to his being jocularly called "the only President of the United States who was never President of the United States." Franklin's likeness is ubiquitous. Since 1928, it has adorned American <a href="United%20States%20one%20hundred-dollar%20bill">$100 bills</a>, which are sometimes referred to in slang as "Benjamins" or "Franklins." From 1948 to 1963, Franklin's portrait was on the <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">half dollar</a>. He has appeared on a <a href="United%20States%20fifty-dollar%20bill">$50 bill</a> and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918. Franklin appears on the $1,000 Series EE <a href="Treasury%20security%23Savings%20bond">Savings bond</a>. The city of Philadelphia contains around 5,000 likenesses of Benjamin Franklin, about half of which are located on the University of Pennsylvania campus. Philadelphia's <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Parkway">Benjamin Franklin Parkway</a> (a major thoroughfare) and <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Bridge">Benjamin Franklin Bridge</a> (the first major bridge to connect Philadelphia with New Jersey) are named in his honor.

In 1976, as part of a <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">bicentennial</a> celebration, <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> dedicated a marble statue in Philadelphia's <a href="Franklin%20Institute">Franklin Institute</a> as the <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20National%20Memorial">Benjamin Franklin National Memorial</a>. Many of Franklin's personal possessions are also on display at the Institute, one of the few national memorials located on <a href="property">private property</a>.

In London, his house at 36 Craven Street, which is the only surviving former residence of Benjamin Franklin, was first marked with a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> and has since been opened to the public as the <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20House">Benjamin Franklin House</a>. In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reported on February 11, 1998:

Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time Franklin was living in the house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. Paul Knapman, the Westminster Coroner, said yesterday: "I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest."

The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by <a href="William%20Hewson%20%28surgeon%29">William Hewson</a>, who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.

Franklin <a href="bequest">bequeathed</a> £1,000 (about $4,400 at the time, or about $112,000 in 2011 dollars) each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, in trust to gather interest for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician <a href="Charles-Joseph%20Mathon%20de%20la%20Cour">Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour</a>, who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly <a href="parody">parody</a> of Franklin's "Poor Richard's Almanack" called "Fortunate Richard". The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 "<a href="French%20livre">livres</a>", to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects. Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000 pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia. By 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in Franklin's Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a <a href="Vocational%20school">trade school</a> that became the <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Franklin Institute of Boston</a>, and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.

Benjamin Franklin is a prominent figure in American history comparable to Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, and as such he has been honored on U.S. postage stamps many times. The image of Franklin, the first <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a> of the United States, occurs on the face of U.S. postage more than any other notable American save that of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>.

Franklin appeared on the first U.S. postage stamp <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%23Postmaster">(displayed above)</a> issued in 1847. From 1908 through 1923 the U.S. Post Office issued a series of postage stamps commonly referred to as the <a href="Washington-Franklin%20Issues">Washington-Franklin Issues</a> where, along with George Washington, Franklin was depicted many times over a 14-year period, the longest run of any one series in U.S. postal history. Along with the regular issue stamps Franklin however only appears on a few . Some of the finest portrayals of Franklin on record can be found on the engravings inscribed on the face of U.S. postage.

"<a href="Advice%20to%20a%20Friend%20on%20Choosing%20a%20Mistress">Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress</a>" is a letter written by Benjamin Franklin, dated June 25, 1745, in which Franklin gives advice to a young man about channeling sexual urges. Due to its licentious nature, the letter was not published in collections of Franklin's papers during the nineteenth century. Federal court decisions from the mid-to-late twentieth century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws, using it to make a case against censorship.

"The Princess and the Patriot: <a href="Yekaterina%20Vorontsova-Dashkova">Ekaterina Dashkova</a>, Benjamin Franklin and the Age of Enlightenment" exhibition opened in Philadelphia in February 2006 and ran through December 2006. Benjamin Franklin and Dashkova met only once, in Paris in 1781. Franklin was 75 and Dashkova was 37. Franklin invited Dashkova to become the first woman to join the American Philosophical Society; she was the only woman so honored for another 80 years. Later, Dashkova reciprocated by making him the first American member of the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a>.

As a founding father of the United States, Franklin's name has been attached to many things. Among these are:

Banach space

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, more specifically in <a href="functional%20analysis">functional analysis</a>, a Banach space (pronounced ) is a <a href="complete%20metric%20space">complete</a> <a href="normed%20vector%20space">normed vector space</a>. Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a <a href="metric%20%28mathematics%29">metric</a> that allows the computation of <a href="Norm%20%28mathematics%29">vector length</a> and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a <a href="Cauchy%20sequence">Cauchy sequence</a> of vectors always converges to a well defined <a href="Limit%20of%20a%20sequence">limit</a> that is within the space.

Banach spaces are named after the Polish mathematician <a href="Stefan%20Banach">Stefan Banach</a>, who introduced this concept and studied it systematically in 1920–1922 along with <a href="Hans%20Hahn%20%28mathematician%29">Hans Hahn</a> and <a href="Eduard%20Helly">Eduard Helly</a>. Banach spaces originally grew out of the study of <a href="function%20space">function space</a>s by <a href="David%20Hilbert">Hilbert</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Ren%C3%A9%20Fr%C3%A9chet">Fréchet</a>, and <a href="Frigyes%20Riesz">Riesz</a> earlier in the century. Banach spaces play a central role in functional analysis. In other areas of <a href="analysis%20%28mathematics%29">analysis</a>, the spaces under study are often Banach spaces.

A Banach space is a <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a> over the field of real numbers, or over the field of complex numbers, which is equipped with a <a href="norm%20%28mathematics%29">norm</a> and which is <a href="complete%20metric%20space">complete</a> with respect to that norm, that is to say, for every <a href="Cauchy%20sequence">Cauchy sequence</a> in , there exists an element in such that

or equivalently:

The vector space structure allows one to relate the behavior of Cauchy sequences to that of converging <a href="Series%20%28mathematics%29%23Generalizations">series of vectors</a>. A normed space is a Banach space if and only if each <a href="Series%20%28mathematics%29">absolutely convergent</a> series in converges,

Completeness of a normed space is preserved if the given norm is replaced by an <a href="Norm%20%28mathematics%29%23Definition">equivalent</a> one.

All norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent. Every finite-dimensional normed space over or is a Banach space.

If and are normed spaces over the same <a href="ground%20field">ground field</a> , the set of all <a href="continuous%20function%20%28topology%29">continuous</a> <a href="linear%20transformation">-linear maps</a> is denoted by . In infinite-dimensional spaces, not all linear maps are continuous. A linear mapping from a normed space to another normed space is continuous if and only if it is <a href="bounded%20operator">bounded</a> on the closed <a href="Unit%20sphere">unit ball</a> of . Thus, the vector space can be given the <a href="operator%20norm">operator norm</a>

For a Banach space, the space is a Banach space with respect to this norm.

If is a Banach space, the space forms a unital <a href="Banach%20algebra">Banach algebra</a>; the multiplication operation is given by the composition of linear maps.

If and are normed spaces, they are isomorphic normed spaces if there exists a linear bijection such that and its inverse are continuous. If one of the two spaces or is complete (or <a href="Reflexive%20space">reflexive</a>, <a href="Separable%20space">separable</a>, etc.) then so is the other space. Two normed spaces and are isometrically isomorphic if in addition, is an <a href="isometry">isometry</a>, i.e., for every in . The <a href="Banach%E2%80%93Mazur%20distance">Banach–Mazur distance</a> between two isomorphic but not isometric spaces and gives a measure of how much the two spaces and differ.

Every normed space can be isometrically embedded in a Banach space. More precisely, there is a Banach space and an <a href="Isometry">isometric mapping</a> such that is dense in . If is another Banach space such that there is an isometric isomorphism from onto a dense subset of , then is isometrically isomorphic to .

This Banach space is the <a href="Complete%20metric%20space%23Completion">completion</a> of the normed space . The underlying metric space for is the same as the metric completion of , with the vector space operations extended from to . The completion of is often denoted by formula_5.

The cartesian product of two normed spaces is not canonically equipped with a norm. However, several equivalent norms are commonly used, such as

and give rise to isomorphic normed spaces. In this sense, the product (or the direct sum ) is complete if and only if the two factors are complete.

If is a <a href="closed%20set">closed</a> <a href="linear%20subspace">linear subspace</a> of a normed space , there is a natural norm on the quotient space ,

The quotient is a Banach space when is complete. The quotient map from onto , sending in to its class , is linear, onto and has norm , except when , in which case the quotient is the null space.

The closed linear subspace of is said to be a complemented subspace of if is the <a href="Range%20%28mathematics%29">range</a> of a bounded linear <a href="Projection%20%28linear%20algebra%29">projection</a> from onto . In this case, the space is isomorphic to the direct sum of and , the kernel of the projection .

Suppose that and are Banach spaces and that . There exists a canonical factorization of as

where the first map is the quotient map, and the second map sends every class in the quotient to the image in . This is well defined because all elements in the same class have the same image. The mapping is a linear bijection from onto the range , whose inverse need not be bounded.

Basic examples of Banach spaces include: the <a href="Lp%20space">spaces</a> and their special cases, the <a href="sequence%20space%20%28mathematics%29">sequence spaces</a> that consist of scalar sequences indexed by <a href="Natural%20number"></a>; among them, the space of <a href="Absolute%20convergence">absolutely summable</a> sequences and the space of square summable sequences; the space of sequences tending to zero and the space of bounded sequences; the space of continuous scalar functions on a compact Hausdorff space , equipped with the max norm,

According to the <a href="Banach%E2%80%93Mazur%20theorem">Banach–Mazur theorem</a>, every Banach space is isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of some . For every separable Banach space , there is a closed subspace of such that .

Any <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert space</a> serves as an example of a Banach space. A Hilbert space on is complete for a norm of the form

where

is the <a href="Inner%20product%20space">inner product</a>, linear in its first argument that satisfies the following:

For example, the space is a Hilbert space.

The <a href="Hardy%20space">Hardy space</a>s, the <a href="Sobolev%20space">Sobolev space</a>s are examples of Banach spaces that are related to spaces and have additional structure. They are important in different branches of analysis, <a href="Harmonic%20analysis">Harmonic analysis</a> and <a href="Partial%20differential%20equation">Partial differential equation</a>s among others.

A <a href="Banach%20algebra">Banach algebra</a> is a Banach space over or , together with a structure of <a href="Algebra%20over%20a%20field">algebra over</a>, such that the product map "A" × "A" ∋ is continuous. An equivalent norm on can be found so that for all .


If is a normed space and the underlying <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> (either the <a href="real%20number">real</a> or the <a href="complex%20number">complex</a> numbers), the <a href="dual%20space%23Continuous%20dual%20space">continuous dual space</a> is the space of continuous linear maps from into , or continuous linear functionals. The notation for the continuous dual is in this article. Since is a Banach space (using the <a href="absolute%20value">absolute value</a> as norm), the dual is a Banach space, for every normed space .

The main tool for proving the existence of continuous linear functionals is the <a href="Hahn%E2%80%93Banach%20theorem">Hahn–Banach theorem</a>.

In particular, every continuous linear functional on a subspace of a normed space can be continuously extended to the whole space, without increasing the norm of the functional. An important special case is the following: for every vector in a normed space , there exists a continuous linear functional on such that

When is not equal to the vector, the functional must have norm one, and is called a norming functional for .

The <a href="Hahn%E2%80%93Banach%20separation%20theorem">Hahn–Banach separation theorem</a> states that two disjoint non-empty <a href="convex%20set">convex set</a>s in a real Banach space, one of them open, can be separated by a closed <a href="Affine%20space">affine</a> <a href="hyperplane">hyperplane</a>. The open convex set lies strictly on one side of the hyperplane, the second convex set lies on the other side but may touch the hyperplane.

A subset in a Banach space is total if the <a href="linear%20span">linear span</a> of is <a href="Dense%20set">dense</a> in . The subset is total in if and only if the only continuous linear functional that vanishes on is the functional: this equivalence follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem.

If is the direct sum of two closed linear subspaces and , then the dual of is isomorphic to the direct sum of the duals of and . If is a closed linear subspace in , one can associate the "orthogonal of" in the dual,

The orthogonal is a closed linear subspace of the dual. The dual of is isometrically isomorphic to . The dual of is isometrically isomorphic to .

The dual of a separable Banach space need not be separable, but:

When is separable, the above criterion for totality can be used for proving the existence of a countable total subset in .

The <a href="weak%20topology">weak topology</a> on a Banach space is the <a href="Comparison%20of%20topologies">coarsest topology</a> on for which all elements in the continuous dual space are continuous. The norm topology is therefore <a href="Comparison%20of%20topologies">finer</a> than the weak topology. It follows from the Hahn–Banach separation theorem that the weak topology is <a href="Hausdorff%20space">Hausdorff</a>, and that a norm-closed <a href="Convex%20set">convex subset</a> of a Banach space is also weakly closed. A norm-continuous linear map between two Banach spaces and is also weakly continuous, i.e., continuous from the weak topology of to that of .

If is infinite-dimensional, there exist linear maps which are not continuous. The space of all linear maps from to the underlying field (this space is called the <a href="Dual%20space%23Algebraic%20dual%20space">algebraic dual space</a>, to distinguish it from ) also induces a topology on which is <a href="finer%20topology">finer</a> than the weak topology, and much less used in functional analysis.

On a dual space , there is a topology weaker than the weak topology of , called <a href="weak%20topology">weak* topology</a>. It is the coarsest topology on for which all evaluation maps , are continuous. Its importance comes from the <a href="Banach%E2%80%93Alaoglu%20theorem">Banach–Alaoglu theorem</a>.

The Banach–Alaoglu theorem depends on <a href="Tychonoff%27s%20theorem">Tychonoff's theorem</a> about infinite products of compact spaces. When is separable, the unit ball of the dual is a <a href="Metrization%20theorem">metrizable</a> compact in the weak* topology.

The dual of is isometrically isomorphic to : for every bounded linear functional on , there is a unique element such that

The dual of is isometrically isomorphic to . The dual of <a href="Lp%20space%23Properties%20of%20Lp%20spaces"></a> is isometrically isomorphic to when and .

For every vector in a Hilbert space , the mapping

defines a continuous linear functional on . The <a href="Riesz%20representation%20theorem">Riesz representation theorem</a> states that every continuous linear functional on is of the form for a uniquely defined vector in . The mapping is an <a href="Antilinear%20map">antilinear</a> isometric bijection from onto its dual . When the scalars are real, this map is an isometric isomorphism.

When is a compact Hausdorff topological space, the dual of is the space of <a href="Radon%20measure">Radon measure</a>s in the sense of Bourbaki. The subset of consisting of non-negative measures of mass 1 (<a href="probability%20measure">probability measure</a>s) is a convex w*-closed subset of the unit ball of . The <a href="extreme%20point">extreme point</a>s of are the <a href="Dirac%20measure">Dirac measure</a>s on . The set of Dirac measures on , equipped with the w*-topology, is <a href="Homeomorphism">homeomorphic</a> to .

The result has been extended by Amir and Cambern to the case when the multiplicative <a href="Banach%E2%80%93Mazur%20compactum">Banach–Mazur distance</a> between and is . The theorem is no longer true when the distance is .

In the commutative <a href="Banach%20algebra">Banach algebra</a> , the <a href="Banach%20algebra%23Ideals%20and%20characters">maximal ideals</a> are precisely kernels of Dirac mesures on ,

More generally, by the <a href="Gelfand%E2%80%93Mazur%20theorem">Gelfand–Mazur theorem</a>, the maximal ideals of a unital commutative Banach algebra can be identified with its <a href="Banach%20algebra%23Ideals%20and%20characters">characters</a>—not merely as sets but as topological spaces: the former with the <a href="hull-kernel%20topology">hull-kernel topology</a> and the latter with the w*-topology. In this identification, the maximal ideal space can be viewed as a w*-compact subset of the unit ball in the dual .

Not every unital commutative Banach algebra is of the form for some compact Hausdorff space . However, this statement holds if one places in the smaller category of commutative <a href="C%2A-algebra">C*-algebra</a>s. <a href="Israel%20Gelfand">Gelfand's</a> <a href="Gelfand%20representation">representation theorem</a> for commutative C*-algebras states that every commutative unital "C"*-algebra is isometrically isomorphic to a space. The Hausdorff compact space here is again the maximal ideal space, also called the <a href="Spectrum%20of%20a%20C%2A-algebra%23Examples">spectrum</a> of in the C*-algebra context.

If is a normed space, the (continuous) dual of the dual is called bidual, or second dual of . For every normed space , there is a natural map,

This defines as a continuous linear functional on , i.e., an element of . The map is a linear map from to . As a consequence of the existence of a <a href="Banach%20space%23Dual%20space">norming functional</a> for every in , this map is isometric, thus <a href="injective">injective</a>.

For example, the dual of is identified with , and the dual of is identified with , the space of bounded scalar sequences. Under these identifications, is the inclusion map from to . It is indeed isometric, but not onto.

If is <a href="surjective">surjective</a>, then the normed space is called reflexive (see <a href="Banach%20space%23Reflexivity">below</a>). Being the dual of a normed space, the bidual is complete, therefore, every reflexive normed space is a Banach space.

Using the isometric embedding , it is customary to consider a normed space as a subset of its bidual. When is a Banach space, it is viewed as a closed linear subspace of . If is not reflexive, the unit ball of is a proper subset of the unit ball of . The <a href="Goldstine%20theorem">Goldstine theorem</a> states that the unit ball of a normed space is weakly*-dense in the unit ball of the bidual. In other words, for every in the bidual, there exists a <a href="Net%20%28mathematics%29">net</a> in so that

The net may be replaced by a weakly*-convergent sequence when the dual is separable. On the other hand, elements of the bidual of that are not in cannot be weak*-limit of "sequences" in , since is <a href="Banach%20space%23Weak%20convergences%20of%20sequences">weakly sequentially complete</a>.

Here are the main general results about Banach spaces that go back to the time of Banach's book () and are related to the <a href="Baire%20category%20theorem">Baire category theorem</a>. According to this theorem, a complete metric space (such as a Banach space, a <a href="Fr%C3%A9chet%20space">Fréchet space</a> or an <a href="F-space">F-space</a>) cannot be equal to a union of countably many closed subsets with empty <a href="Interior%20%28topology%29">interiors</a>. Therefore, a Banach space cannot be the union of countably many closed subspaces, unless it is already equal to one of them; a Banach space with a countable <a href="Hamel%20basis">Hamel basis</a> is finite-dimensional.

The Banach–Steinhaus theorem is not limited to Banach spaces. It can be extended for example to the case where is a <a href="Fr%C3%A9chet%20space">Fréchet space</a>, provided the conclusion is modified as follows: under the same hypothesis, there exists a neighborhood of in such that all in are uniformly bounded on ,

This result is a direct consequence of the preceding "Banach isomorphism theorem" and of the canonical factorization of bounded linear maps.

This is another consequence of Banach's isomorphism theorem, applied to the continuous bijection from onto sending to the sum .

The normed space is called <a href="reflexive%20space">reflexive</a> when the natural map

is surjective. Reflexive normed spaces are Banach spaces.

This is a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem. Further, by the open mapping theorem, if there is a bounded linear operator from the Banach space onto the Banach space , then is reflexive.

Indeed, if the dual of a Banach space is separable, then is separable. If is reflexive and separable, then the dual of is separable, so is separable.

Hilbert spaces are reflexive. The spaces are reflexive when . More generally, <a href="uniformly%20convex%20space">uniformly convex space</a>s are reflexive, by the <a href="Milman%E2%80%93Pettis%20theorem">Milman–Pettis theorem</a>. The spaces are not reflexive. In these examples of non-reflexive spaces , the bidual is "much larger" than . Namely, under the natural isometric embedding of into given by the Hahn–Banach theorem, the quotient is infinite-dimensional, and even nonseparable. However, Robert C. James has constructed an example of a non-reflexive space, usually called ""the James space"" and denoted by "J", such that the quotient is one-dimensional. Furthermore, this space is isometrically isomorphic to its bidual.

When is reflexive, it follows that all closed and bounded <a href="Convex%20set">convex subsets</a> of are weakly compact. In a Hilbert space , the weak compactness of the unit ball is very often used in the following way: every bounded sequence in has weakly convergent subsequences.

Weak compactness of the unit ball provides a tool for finding solutions in reflexive spaces to certain <a href="Infinite-dimensional%20optimization">optimization problems</a>. For example, every <a href="Convex%20function">convex</a> continuous function on the unit ball of a reflexive space attains its minimum at some point in .

As a special case of the preceding result, when is a reflexive space over , every continuous linear functional in attains its maximum on the unit ball of . The following <a href="James%27%20theorem">theorem of Robert C. James</a> provides a converse statement.

The theorem can be extended to give a characterization of weakly compact convex sets.

On every non-reflexive Banach space , there exist continuous linear functionals that are not "norm-attaining". However, the <a href="Errett%20Bishop">Bishop</a>–<a href="Robert%20Phelps">Phelps</a> theorem states that norm-attaining functionals are norm dense in the dual of .

A sequence in a Banach space is weakly convergent to a vector if converges to for every continuous linear functional in the dual . The sequence is a weakly Cauchy sequence if converges to a scalar limit , for every in . A sequence in the dual is weakly* convergent to a functional if converges to for every in . Weakly Cauchy sequences, weakly convergent and weakly* convergent sequences are norm bounded, as a consequence of the <a href="Uniform%20boundedness%20principle">Banach–Steinhaus</a> theorem.

When the sequence in is a weakly Cauchy sequence, the limit above defines a bounded linear functional on the dual , i.e., an element of the bidual of , and is the limit of in the weak*-topology of the bidual. The Banach space is weakly sequentially complete if every weakly Cauchy sequence is weakly convergent in . It follows from the preceding discussion that reflexive spaces are weakly sequentially complete.

An orthonormal sequence in a Hilbert space is a simple example of a weakly convergent sequence, with limit equal to the vector. The <a href="Schauder%20basis%23Examples">unit vector basis</a> of , or of , is another example of a weakly null sequence, i.e., a sequence that converges weakly to . For every weakly null sequence in a Banach space, there exists a sequence of convex combinations of vectors from the given sequence that is norm-converging to .

The unit vector basis of is not weakly Cauchy. Weakly Cauchy sequences in are weakly convergent, since -spaces are weakly sequentially complete. Actually, weakly convergent sequences in are norm convergent. This means that satisfies <a href="Schur%27s%20property">Schur's property</a>.

Weakly Cauchy sequences and the basis are the opposite cases of the dichotomy established in the following deep result of H. P. Rosenthal.

A complement to this result is due to Odell and Rosenthal (1975).

By the Goldstine theorem, every element of the unit ball of is weak*-limit of a net in the unit ball of . When does not contain , every element of is weak*-limit of a "sequence" in the unit ball of .

When the Banach space is separable, the unit ball of the dual , equipped with the weak*-topology, is a metrizable compact space , and every element in the bidual defines a bounded function on :

This function is continuous for the compact topology of if and only if is actually in , considered as subset of . Assume in addition for the rest of the paragraph that does not contain . By the preceding result of Odell and Rosenthal, the function is the <a href="Pointwise%20convergence">pointwise limit</a> on of a sequence of continuous functions on , it is therefore a <a href="Baire%20function">first Baire class function</a> on . The unit ball of the bidual is a pointwise compact subset of the first Baire class on .

When is separable, the unit ball of the dual is weak*-compact by Banach–Alaoglu and metrizable for the weak* topology, hence every bounded sequence in the dual has weakly* convergent subsequences. This applies to separable reflexive spaces, but more is true in this case, as stated below.

The weak topology of a Banach space is metrizable if and only if is finite-dimensional. If the dual is separable, the weak topology of the unit ball of is metrizable. This applies in particular to separable reflexive Banach spaces. Although the weak topology of the unit ball is not metrizable in general, one can characterize weak compactness using sequences.

A Banach space is reflexive if and only if each bounded sequence in has a weakly convergent subsequence.

A weakly compact subset in is norm-compact. Indeed, every sequence in has weakly convergent subsequences by Eberlein–Šmulian, that are norm convergent by the Schur property of .

A Schauder basis in a Banach space is a sequence of vectors in "X" with the property that for every vector in , there exist "uniquely" defined scalars depending on , such that

Banach spaces with a Schauder basis are necessarily <a href="Separable%20space">separable</a>, because the countable set of finite linear combinations with rational coefficients (say) is dense.

It follows from the Banach–Steinhaus theorem that the linear mappings are uniformly bounded by some constant . Let denote the coordinate functionals which assign to every in the coordinate of in the above expansion. They are called biorthogonal functionals. When the basis vectors have norm , the coordinate functionals have norm in the dual of .

Most classical separable spaces have explicit bases. The <a href="Haar%20wavelet">Haar system</a> is a basis for . The <a href="Schauder%20basis%23Examples">trigonometric system</a> is a basis in when . The <a href="Haar%20wavelet%23Haar%20system%20on%20the%20unit%20interval%20and%20related%20systems">Schauder system</a> is a basis in the space . The question of whether the disk algebra has a basis remained open for more than forty years, until Bočkarev showed in 1974 that admits a basis constructed from the <a href="Haar%20wavelet%23Haar%20system%20on%20the%20unit%20interval%20and%20related%20systems">Franklin system</a>.

Since every vector in a Banach space with a basis is the limit of , with of finite rank and uniformly bounded, the space satisfies the <a href="approximation%20property">bounded approximation property</a>. The first example by <a href="Per%20Enflo">Enflo</a> of a space failing the approximation property was at the same time the first example of a separable Banach space without a Schauder basis.

Robert C. James characterized reflexivity in Banach spaces with a basis: the space with a Schauder basis is reflexive if and only if the basis is both <a href="Schauder%20basis%23Schauder%20bases%20and%20duality">shrinking and boundedly complete</a>. In this case, the biorthogonal functionals form a basis of the dual of .

Let and be two -vector spaces. The <a href="tensor%20product">tensor product</a> of and is a -vector space with a bilinear mapping which has the following <a href="universal%20property">universal property</a>:

The image under of a couple in is denoted by , and called a simple tensor. Every element in is a finite sum of such simple tensors.

There are various norms that can be placed on the tensor product of the underlying vector spaces, amongst others the <a href="Topological%20tensor%20product%23Cross%20norms%20and%20tensor%20products%20of%20Banach%20spaces">projective cross norm</a> and <a href="Topological%20tensor%20product%23Cross%20norms%20and%20tensor%20products%20of%20Banach%20spaces">injective cross norm</a> introduced by <a href="Alexander%20Grothendieck">A. Grothendieck</a> in 1955.

In general, the tensor product of complete spaces is not complete again. When working with Banach spaces, it is customary to say that the projective tensor product of two Banach spaces and is the "completion" formula_25 of the algebraic tensor product equipped with the projective tensor norm, and similarly for the injective tensor product formula_26. Grothendieck proved in particular that

where is a compact Hausdorff space, the Banach space of continuous functions from to and the space of Bochner-measurable and integrable functions from to , and where the isomorphisms are isometric. The two isomorphisms above are the respective extensions of the map sending the tensor to the vector-valued function .

Let be a Banach space. The tensor product formula_28 is identified isometrically with the closure in of the set of finite rank operators. When has the <a href="approximation%20property">approximation property</a>, this closure coincides with the space of <a href="compact%20operator">compact operator</a>s on .

For every Banach space , there is a natural norm linear map

obtained by extending the identity map of the algebraic tensor product. Grothendieck related the <a href="Approximation%20property">approximation problem</a> to the question of whether this map is one-to-one when is the dual of . Precisely, for every Banach space , the map

is one-to-one if and only if has the approximation property.

Grothendieck conjectured that formula_25 and formula_26 must be different whenever and are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. This was disproved by <a href="Gilles%20Pisier">Gilles Pisier</a> in 1983. Pisier constructed an infinite-dimensional Banach space such that formula_33 and formula_34 are equal. Furthermore, just as <a href="Per%20Enflo">Enflo's</a> example, this space is a "hand-made" space that fails to have the approximation property. On the other hand, Szankowski proved that the classical space does not have the approximation property.

A necessary and sufficient condition for the norm of a Banach space to be associated to an inner product is the <a href="parallelogram%20identity">parallelogram identity</a>:

It follows, for example, that the <a href="Lp%20space">Lebesgue space</a> is a Hilbert space only when . If this identity is satisfied, the associated inner product is given by the <a href="polarization%20identity">polarization identity</a>. In the case of real scalars, this gives:

For complex scalars, defining the inner product so as to be -linear in , <a href="Antilinear%20map">antilinear</a> in , the polarization identity gives:

To see that the parallelogram law is sufficient, one observes in the real case that is symmetric, and in the complex case, that it satisfies the <a href="Hermitian%20symmetry">Hermitian symmetry</a> property and . The parallelogram law implies that is additive in . It follows that it is linear over the rationals, thus linear by continuity.

Several characterizations of spaces isomorphic (rather than isometric) to Hilbert spaces are available. The parallelogram law can be extended to more than two vectors, and weakened by the introduction of a two-sided inequality with a constant : Kwapień proved that if

for every integer and all families of vectors , then the Banach space is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. Here, denotes the average over the possible choices of signs . In the same article, Kwapień proved that the validity of a Banach-valued <a href="Parseval%27s%20theorem">Parseval's theorem</a> for the Fourier transform characterizes Banach spaces isomorphic to Hilbert spaces.

Lindenstrauss and Tzafriri proved that a Banach space in which every closed linear subspace is complemented (that is, is the range of a bounded linear projection) is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. The proof rests upon <a href="Dvoretzky%27s%20theorem">Dvoretzky's theorem</a> about Euclidean sections of high-dimensional centrally symmetric convex bodies. In other words, Dvoretzky's theorem states that for every integer , any finite-dimensional normed space, with dimension sufficiently large compared to , contains subspaces nearly isometric to the -dimensional Euclidean space.

The next result gives the solution of the so-called "homogeneous space problem". An infinite-dimensional Banach space is said to be homogeneous if it is isomorphic to all its infinite-dimensional closed subspaces. A Banach space isomorphic to is homogeneous, and Banach asked for the converse.

An infinite-dimensional Banach space is hereditarily indecomposable when no subspace of it can be isomorphic to the direct sum of two infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. The <a href="Timothy%20Gowers">Gowers</a> dichotomy theorem asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space contains, either a subspace with <a href="Schauder%20basis%23Unconditionality">unconditional basis</a>, or a hereditarily indecomposable subspace , and in particular, is not isomorphic to its closed hyperplanes. If is homogeneous, it must therefore have an unconditional basis. It follows then from the partial solution obtained by Komorowski and <a href="Nicole%20Tomczak-Jaegermann">Tomczak–Jaegermann</a>, for spaces with an unconditional basis, that is isomorphic to .

When two compact Hausdorff spaces and are <a href="Homeomorphism">homeomorphic</a>, the Banach spaces and are isometric. Conversely, when is not homeomorphic to , the (multiplicative) Banach–Mazur distance between and must be greater than or equal to , see above the <a href="Banach%20space%23Examples%20of%20dual%20spaces">results by Amir and Cambern</a>. Although uncountable compact metric spaces can have different homeomorphy types, one has the following result due to Milutin:

The situation is different for <a href="Countable%20set">countably infinite</a> compact Hausdorff spaces. Every countably infinite compact is homeomorphic to some closed interval of <a href="ordinal%20number">ordinal number</a>s

equipped with the <a href="order%20topology">order topology</a>, where is a countably infinite ordinal. The Banach space is then isometric to . When are two countably infinite ordinals, and assuming , the spaces and are isomorphic if and only if .
For example, the Banach spaces

are mutually non-isomorphic.

A glossary of symbols:

Several concepts of a derivative may be defined on a Banach space. See the articles on the <a href="Fr%C3%A9chet%20derivative">Fréchet derivative</a> and the <a href="G%C3%A2teaux%20derivative">Gâteaux derivative</a> for details. The Fréchet derivative allows for an extension of the concept of a <a href="directional%20derivative">directional derivative</a> to Banach spaces. The Gâteaux derivative allows for an extension of a <a href="directional%20derivative">directional derivative</a> to <a href="locally%20convex">locally convex</a> <a href="topological%20vector%20space">topological vector space</a>s. Fréchet differentiability is a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability. The <a href="quasi-derivative">quasi-derivative</a> is another generalization of directional derivative that implies a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability, but a weaker condition than Fréchet differentiability.

Several important spaces in functional analysis, for instance the space of all infinitely often differentiable functions R → R, or the space of all <a href="distribution%20%28mathematics%29">distributions</a> on R, are complete but are not normed vector spaces and hence not Banach spaces. In <a href="Fr%C3%A9chet%20space">Fréchet space</a>s one still has a complete <a href="metric%20space">metric</a>, while <a href="LF-space">LF-space</a>s are complete <a href="uniform%20space">uniform</a> vector spaces arising as limits of Fréchet spaces.

Bram Stoker

Abraham "Bram" Stoker (8 November 1847 – 20 April 1912) was an <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> author, best known today for his 1897 <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic</a> novel "<a href="Dracula">Dracula</a>". During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a> and business manager of the <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%2C%20London">Lyceum Theatre</a> in London, which Irving owned.

Stoker was born on 8 November 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent, <a href="Clontarf%2C%20Dublin">Clontarf</a>, on the northside of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, Ireland. His parents were Abraham Stoker (1799–1876) from Dublin and Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley (1818–1901), who was raised in <a href="County%20Sligo">County Sligo</a>. Stoker was the third of seven children, the eldest of whom was <a href="Thornley%20Stoker">Sir Thornley Stoker</a>, 1st <a href="Baronet">Bt.</a> Abraham and Charlotte were members of the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland%20Parish%20of%20Clontarf">Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf</a> and attended the parish church with their children, who were baptised there.

Stoker was bedridden with an unknown illness until he started school at the age of seven, when he made a complete recovery. Of this time, Stoker wrote, "I was naturally thoughtful, and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years." He was educated in a private school run by the Rev. William Woods.

After his recovery, he grew up without further serious illnesses, even excelling as an athlete (he was named University Athlete) at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin">Trinity College, Dublin</a>, which he attended from 1864 to 1870. He graduated with honours as a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">B.A.</a> in Mathematics. He was auditor of the <a href="College%20Historical%20Society%20%28Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin%29">College Historical Society</a> ("the Hist") and president of the <a href="University%20Philosophical%20Society%20%28Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin%29">University Philosophical Society</a>, where his first paper was on "Sensationalism in Fiction and Society".

Stoker became interested in the theatre while a student through his friend Dr. Maunsell. He became the theatre critic for the "<a href="Dublin%20Evening%20Mail">Dublin Evening Mail</a>", co-owned by the author of Gothic tales <a href="Sheridan%20Le%20Fanu">Sheridan Le Fanu</a>. Theatre critics were held in low esteem, but he attracted notice by the quality of his reviews. In December 1876, he gave a favourable review of Henry Irving's "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Dublin">Theatre Royal</a> in Dublin. Irving invited Stoker for dinner at the <a href="Shelbourne%20Hotel">Shelbourne Hotel</a> where he was staying, and they became friends. Stoker also wrote stories, and "The Crystal Cup" was published by the London Society in 1872, followed by "The Chain of Destiny" in four parts in "The Shamrock". In 1876 while a <a href="civil%20servant">civil servant</a> in Dublin, Stoker wrote the non-fiction book "The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland" (published 1879) which remained a standard work. Furthermore, he possessed an interest in art, and was a founder of the Dublin Sketching Club in 1879.

In 1878 Stoker married <a href="Florence%20Balcombe">Florence Balcombe</a>, daughter of <a href="Lieutenant-colonel%20%28British%20Army%29">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent. She was a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>. Stoker had known Wilde from his student days, having proposed him for membership of the university’s Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florence's decision, but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship, and after Wilde's fall visited him on the Continent.

The Stokers moved to London, where Stoker became acting manager and then business manager of <a href="Henry%20Irving">Irving</a>'s <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%2C%20London">Lyceum Theatre, London</a>, a post he held for 27 years. On 31 December 1879, Bram and Florence's only child was born, a son whom they christened Irving Noel Thornley Stoker. The collaboration with Henry Irving was important for Stoker and through him he became involved in London's <a href="upper%20class">high society</a>, where he met <a href="James%20Abbott%20McNeill%20Whistler">James Abbott McNeill Whistler</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> (to whom he was distantly related). Working for Irving, the most famous actor of his time, and managing one of the most successful theatres in London made Stoker a notable if busy man. He was dedicated to Irving and his memoirs show he idolised him. In London Stoker also met <a href="Hall%20Caine">Hall Caine</a>, who became one of his closest friends – he dedicated "Dracula" to him.

In the course of Irving's tours, Stoker travelled the world, although he never visited <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, a setting for his most famous novel. Stoker enjoyed the United States, where Irving was popular. With Irving he was invited twice to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, and knew <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> and <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. Stoker set two of his novels there, using Americans as characters, the most notable being <a href="Quincey%20Morris">Quincey Morris</a>. He also met one of his literary idols, <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>.

Stoker visited the English coastal town of <a href="Whitby">Whitby</a> in 1890, and that visit is said to be part of the inspiration for "<a href="Dracula">Dracula</a>". He began writing novels while manager for <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a> and secretary and director of London's Lyceum Theatre, beginning with "<a href="The%20Snake%27s%20Pass">The Snake's Pass</a>" in 1890 and "Dracula" in 1897. During this period, Stoker was part of the literary staff of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" in London, and he wrote other fiction, including the horror novels "<a href="The%20Lady%20of%20the%20Shroud">The Lady of the Shroud</a>" (1909) and "<a href="The%20Lair%20of%20the%20White%20Worm">The Lair of the White Worm</a>" (1911). He published his "<a href="Personal%20Reminiscences%20of%20Henry%20Irving">Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving</a>" in 1906, after Irving's death, which proved successful, and managed productions at the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Theatre">Prince of Wales Theatre</a>.

Before writing "Dracula", Stoker met <a href="%C3%81rmin%20V%C3%A1mb%C3%A9ry">Ármin Vámbéry</a>, a Hungarian writer and traveller. Dracula likely emerged from Vámbéry's dark stories of the <a href="Carpathian%20mountains">Carpathian mountains</a>. Stoker then spent several years researching European folklore and mythological stories of <a href="vampire">vampire</a>s. 

The 1972 book "In Search of Dracula" by <a href="Radu%20Florescu">Radu Florescu</a> and <a href="Raymond%20McNally">Raymond McNally</a> claimed that the Count in Stoker's novel was based Vlad III Dracula. At most however, Stoker borrowed only the name and "scraps of miscellaneous information" about Romanian history, according to one expert, <a href="Elizabeth%20Miller%20%28academic%29">Elizabeth Miller</a>; as well, and there are no comments about Vlad III in the author's working notes.
"Dracula" is an <a href="epistolary%20novel">epistolary novel</a>, written as a collection of realistic but completely fictional diary entries, telegrams, letters, ship's logs, and newspaper clippings, all of which added a level of detailed realism to the story, a skill which Stoker had developed as a newspaper writer. At the time of its publication, "Dracula" was considered a "straightforward horror novel" based on imaginary creations of <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> life. "It gave form to a universal fantasy . . . and became a part of popular culture." 

Stoker was a deeply private man, but his almost sexless marriage, intense adoration of <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a> and <a href="Hall%20Caine">Hall Caine</a>, and shared interests with <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, as well as the homoerotic aspects of "<a href="Dracula">Dracula</a>" have led to scholarly speculation that he was a repressed homosexual who used his fiction as an outlet for his sexual frustrations. In 1912, he demanded imprisonment of all homosexual authors in Britain: it has been suggested that this was due to self-loathing and to disguise his own vulnerability. A friend of Wilde, Stoker commenced writing "Dracula" only weeks after his conviction, possibly fearful and inspired by the monstrous image and threat of otherness that the press coverage of the Wilde trials generated. 

According to the "Encyclopedia of World Biography", Stoker's stories are today included in the categories of "horror fiction", "romanticized Gothic" stories, and "melodrama." They are classified alongside other "works of popular fiction" such as <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>'s "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>", which also used the "myth-making" and story-telling method of having <a href="multiperspectivity">multiple narrators</a> telling the same tale from different perspectives, according to historian Jules Zanger. "'They can't all be lying,' thinks the reader."

The original 541-page typescript of "Dracula" was believed to have been lost until it was found in a barn in northwestern Pennsylvania in the early 1980s. It consisted of typed sheets with many emendations, plus handwritten on the title page was "THE UN-DEAD." The author's name was shown at the bottom as Bram Stoker. Author Robert Latham remarked: "the most famous horror novel ever published, its title changed at the last minute." The typescript was purchased by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> co-founder <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a>.

Stoker's inspirations for the story, in addition to Whitby, may have included a visit to <a href="New%20Slains%20Castle">Slains Castle</a> in <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a>, a visit to the crypts of <a href="St.%20Michan%27s%20Church">St. Michan's Church</a> in Dublin, and the novella "<a href="Carmilla">Carmilla</a>" by <a href="Sheridan%20Le%20Fanu">Sheridan Le Fanu</a>.

Stoker's original research notes for the novel are kept by the <a href="Rosenbach%20Museum%20%26amp%3B%20Library">Rosenbach Museum and Library</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. A facsimile edition of the notes was created by <a href="Elizabeth%20Miller%20%28academic%29">Elizabeth Miller</a> and <a href="Robert%20Eighteen-Bisang">Robert Eighteen-Bisang</a> in 1998.

After suffering a number of strokes, Stoker died at No. 26 <a href="St%20George%27s%20Square">St George's Square</a>, London on 20 April 1912. Some biographers attribute the cause of death to <a href="tertiary%20syphilis">tertiary syphilis</a>, others to overwork. He was <a href="Cremation">cremated</a>, and his ashes were placed in a display urn at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a> in north London. The ashes of Irving Noel Stoker, the author's son, were added to his father's urn following his death in 1961. The original plan had been to keep his parents' ashes together, but after Florence Stoker's death, her ashes were scattered at the Gardens of Rest.

Stoker was raised a Protestant in the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>. He was a strong supporter of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> and took a keen interest in Irish affairs. As a "philosophical home ruler," he supported <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20bills">Home Rule</a> for Ireland brought about by peaceful means. He remained an ardent monarchist who believed that Ireland should remain within the British Empire, an entity that he saw as a force for good. He was an admirer of Prime Minister <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>, whom he knew personally, and supported his plans for Ireland.

Stoker believed in progress and took a keen interest in <a href="science">science</a> and science-based <a href="medicine">medicine</a>. Some Stoker novels represent early examples of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, such as "<a href="The%20Lady%20of%20the%20Shroud">The Lady of the Shroud</a>" (1909). He had a writer's interest in the occult, notably <a href="mesmerism">mesmerism</a>, but despised fraud and believed in the superiority of the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a> over superstition. Stoker counted among his friends J. W. Brodie-Innis, a member of the <a href="Hermetic%20Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a>, and hired member <a href="Pamela%20Colman%20Smith">Pamela Colman Smith</a> as an artist for the Lyceum Theatre, but no evidence suggests that Stoker ever joined the Order himself.

The short story collection "<a href="Dracula%27s%20Guest%20and%20Other%20Weird%20Stories">Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories</a>" was published in 1914 by Stoker's widow, Florence Stoker, who was also his literary executrix. The first film adaptation of "Dracula" was <a href="F.%20W.%20Murnau">F. W. Murnau</a>'s "<a href="Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a>", released in 1922, with <a href="Max%20Schreck">Max Schreck</a> starring as Count Orlock. Florence Stoker eventually sued the filmmakers, and was represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors. Her chief legal complaint was that she had neither been asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty. The case dragged on for some years, with Mrs. Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the film. The suit was finally resolved in the widow's favour in July 1925. A single print of the film survived, however, and it has become well known. The first authorised film version of "Dracula" did not come about until almost a decade later when <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> released <a href="Tod%20Browning">Tod Browning</a>'s "<a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">Dracula</a>" starring <a href="Bela%20Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a>.

<a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> writer <a href="Dacre%20Stoker">Dacre Stoker</a>, a great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker, decided to write "a sequel that bore the Stoker name" to "reestablish creative control over" the original novel, with encouragement from screenwriter Ian Holt, because of the Stokers' frustrating history with "Dracula's" copyright. In 2009, "<a href="Dracula%20the%20Un-dead">Dracula: The Un-Dead</a>" was released, written by Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt. Both writers "based [their work] on Bram Stoker's own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition" along with their own research for the sequel. This also marked Dacre Stoker's writing debut.

In Spring 2012, Dacre Stoker (in collaboration with Prof. Elizabeth Miller) presented the "lost" Dublin Journal written by Bram Stoker, which had been kept by his great-grandson Noel Dobbs. Stoker's diary entries shed a light on the issues that concerned him before his London years. A remark about a boy who caught flies in a bottle might be a clue for the later development of the Renfield character in "Dracula".

On 8 November 2012, Stoker was honoured with a <a href="Google%20Doodle">Google Doodle</a> on Google's homepage commemorating his 165th birthday.

An annual festival takes place in Dublin, the birthplace of Bram Stoker, in honour of his literary achievements. The 2014 Bram Stoker Festival encompassed literary, film, family, street, and outdoor events, and ran from 24–27 October in and around Dublin City. The festival is supported by the Bram Stoker Estate and funded by <a href="Dublin%20City%20Council">Dublin City Council</a> and <a href="F%C3%A1ilte%20Ireland">Fáilte Ireland</a>.

Contract bridge

Contract bridge, or simply bridge, is a <a href="trick-taking%20card%20game">trick-taking card game</a> using a <a href="standard%2052-card%20deck">standard 52-card deck</a>. It is played by four players in two competing partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other around a table. Millions of people play bridge worldwide in clubs, <a href="bridge%20tournaments">tournaments</a>, online and with friends at home, making it one of the world's most popular <a href="card%20game">card game</a>s, particularly among seniors. The <a href="World%20Bridge%20Federation">World Bridge Federation (WBF)</a> is the governing body for international competitive bridge, with numerous other bodies governing bridge at the regional level.

The game consists of several , each progressing through four phases. The cards are <a href="%23Dealing">dealt</a> to the players, and then the players <a href="%23Auction%20or%20bidding">auction</a> or "bid" to take the , specifying how many tricks the partnership receiving the contract (the declaring side) needs to take to receive points for the deal. During the auction, partners communicate information about their hand, including its overall strength and the length of its suits, although conventions for use during play also exist. The cards are then <a href="%23Play%20of%20the%20cards">played</a>, the trying to fulfill the contract, and the trying to stop the declaring side achieving its goal. The deal is <a href="%23Scoring">scored</a> based on the number of tricks taken, the contract, and various other factors which depend to some extent on the variation of the game being played.

<a href="Rubber%20bridge">Rubber bridge</a> is the most popular variation for casual play, but most club and tournament play involves some variant of <a href="duplicate%20bridge">duplicate bridge</a>, where the cards are not re-dealt on each occasion, but the same deal is played by two or more different sets of players to enable comparative scoring.

One theory is that the name "bridge" has its origins in the name of an earlier game. Bridge departed from <a href="whist">whist</a> with the creation of in the 19th century, and evolved through the late 19th and early 20th centuries to form the present game. The word "biritch" itself is a spelling of the Russian word (бирчий, бирич), an occupation of a diplomatic clerk or an announcer. However some experts think that the Russian origin of the game is a fallacy.

Another theory is that British soldiers invented the game bridge while serving in the Crimean War. The game "got its name from the <a href="Galata%20Bridge">Galata Bridge</a>, a bridge spanning the Golden Horn and linking the old and new parts of European Istanbul, where they apparently crossed every day to go to a coffeehouse to play cards."

Bridge is a four-player partnership <a href="trick-taking%20game">trick-taking game</a> with thirteen tricks per deal. The dominant variations of the game are <a href="rubber%20bridge">rubber bridge</a>, more common in social play; and <a href="duplicate%20bridge">duplicate bridge</a>, which enables comparative scoring in tournament play. Each player is dealt thirteen cards from a standard 52-card deck. A starts when a player leads, i.e. plays the first card. The leader to the first trick is determined by the auction; the leader to each subsequent trick is the player who won the preceding trick. Each player, in a clockwise order, plays one card on the trick. Players must play a card of the same suit as the original card led, unless they have none (said to be "void"), in which case they may play any card.

The player who played the highest-ranked card wins the trick. Within a suit, the ace is ranked highest followed by the king, queen and jack and then the ten through to the two. In a deal where the auction has determined that there is no trump suit, the trick must be won by a card of the suit led. However, in a deal where there is a trump suit, cards of that suit are superior in rank to any of the cards of any other suit. If one or more players plays a trump to a trick when void in the suit led, the highest trump wins. For example, if the trump suit is spades and a player is void in the suit led and plays a spade card, he wins the trick if no other player plays a higher spade. If a trump suit is led, the usual rule for trick-taking applies.

Unlike its predecessor <a href="Whist">Whist</a>, the goal of bridge is not simply to take the most tricks in a deal. Instead, the goal is to successfully estimate how many tricks one's partnership can take. To illustrate this, the simpler partnership trick-taking game of <a href="Spades%20%28card%20game%29">Spades</a> has a similar mechanism: the usual trick-taking rules apply with the trump suit being spades, but in the beginning of the game, players "bid" or estimate how many tricks they can win, and the number of tricks bid by both players in a partnership are added. If a partnership takes at least that many number of tricks, they receive points for the round; otherwise, they receive penalty points.

Bridge extends the concept of bidding into an , where partnerships compete to take a , specifying how many tricks they will need to take in order to receive points, and also specifying the trump suit (or no trump, meaning that there will be no trump suit). Players take turns to call in a clockwise order: each player in turn either passes, doubles—which increases the penalties for not making the contract specified by the opposing partnership's last bid, but also increases the reward for making it—or redoubles, or states a contract that their partnership will adopt, which must be higher than the previous highest bid (if any). Eventually, the player who bid the highest contract—which is determined by the contract's level as well as the trump suit or no trump—wins the contract for their partnership.

After the contract is decided, and the first lead is made, the declarer's partner (dummy) lays his cards face up on the table, and the declarer plays the dummy's cards as well as their own. The opposing partnership is called the , and their goal is to stop the declarer fulfilling his contract. Once all the cards have been played, the hand is scored: if the declaring side make their contract, they receive points based on the level of the contract, with some trump suits being worth more points than others and no trump being the highest, as well as bonus points for . But if the declarer fails to fulfil the contract, the defenders receive points depending on the declaring side's undertricks (the number of tricks short of the contract) and whether the contract was doubled by the defenders.

The four players sit in two partnerships, with each player sitting opposite his partner. <a href="Cardinal%20directions">Cardinal directions</a> are assigned to each seat, so that one partnership sits in North and South, while the other sits in West and East. The cards may be freshly dealt or, in duplicate bridge where partnerships compete with each other, dealt beforehand. All that is needed in basic games are the cards and a method of keeping score, but there is often other equipment on the table, such as a board containing the cards to be played (in duplicate bridge), <a href="bidding%20box">bidding box</a>es, or <a href="Screen%20%28bridge%29">screens</a>.

In rubber bridge, each player draws a card at the start of the game: the two players who drew the highest cards are partners, and play against the other two. The deck is shuffled and cut, usually by the player to the left of the dealer, before dealing. Players take turns to deal, in a clockwise order. The dealer deals the cards clockwise, one card at a time.

In duplicate bridge, the cards are pre-dealt in order to allow for competitive scoring. Once dealt, the cards are stored in a device called a <a href="Board%20%28bridge%29">"board"</a>, with a slot for each cardinal direction. The director of a duplicate bridge game or their assistants may shuffle the decks immediately before play starts, or in advance. After a deal has been played, all four players slot their cards back into the board, ready to be played by the next table.

The dealer opens the auction and can make the first call, and the auction proceeds clockwise. When it is their turn to call, a player may pass—but can enter into the bidding later—or bid a contract, specifying the level of their contract and either the trump suit or no trump (the denomination), provided that it is higher than the last bid by any player, including their partner. All bids promise to take a number of tricks in excess of six, so a bid must be between one (seven tricks) and seven (thirteen tricks). A bid is higher than another bid if either the level is greater (e.g., 2 over 1NT) or the denomination is higher, with the order being in ascending order: , , , , and NT (no trump). Calls may be made orally, or with a bidding box, or digitally in online bridge.

If the last bid was by the opposing partnership, one may also the opponents' bid, increasing the penalties for undertricks, but also increasing the reward for making the contract. Doubling does not carry to future bids by the opponents unless future bids are doubled again. A player on the opposing partnership being doubled may also , which increases the penalties and rewards further. Players may not see their partner's hand during the auction, only their own. There exist many bidding conventions that assign agreed meanings to various calls to assist players in reaching an optimal contract (or obstruct the opponents).

The auction ends when, after a player bids, doubles, or redoubles, every other player has passed, in which case the action proceeds to the play; or every player has passed and no bid has been made, in which case the round is considered to be "passed out" and not played.

The player from the declaring side who first bid the denomination named in the final contract becomes declarer. The player left to the declarer leads to the first trick. Then the dummy lays their cards face up on the table. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player required to follow suit if possible. Tricks are won by the highest trump, or if there were none played, the highest card of the led suit. The player who won the previous trick leads to the next trick. The declarer has control of the dummy's cards and plays them when it is their turn, although the declarer often requests his partner to play a specified card on his behalf. There also exist conventions that communicate further information between defenders about their hands during the play.

At any time, a player may , stating that their side will win a specific number of the remaining tricks, and if not obvious explains how he intends to play the remaining cards. The claiming player lays their cards down on the table for examination. The opponents can either accept the claim and the round is scored accordingly, or dispute the claim. In rubber games, play continues with the claiming player's cards face up. In duplicate games, play ceases and the tournament director is called to adjudicate the hand.

At the end of the hand, points are awarded to the declaring side if they make the contract, or else to the defenders. Partnerships can be , increasing the rewards for making the contract, but also increasing the penalties for undertricks. In rubber bridge, if a side has won 100 contract points, they have won a and are vulnerable for the remaining rounds, but in duplicate bridge, vulnerability is predetermined based on the number of each board.

If the declaring side makes their contract, they receive points for , or tricks bid and made in excess of six. In both rubber and duplicate bridge, the declaring side is awarded 20 points per odd trick for a contract in clubs or diamonds, and 30 points per odd trick for a contract in hearts or spades. For a contract in no trump, the declaring side is awarded 40 points for the first odd trick and 30 points for the remaining odd tricks. Contract points are doubled or quadrupled if the contract is respectively doubled or redoubled.

In rubber bridge, a partnership wins one game once it has accumulated 100 contract points; excess contract points do not carry over to the next game. A partnership that wins two games wins the rubber, receiving a bonus of 500 points if the opposing side is not vulnerable, and 700 points if the opposing side is vulnerable.

Overtricks score the same number of points per odd trick, although their doubled and redoubled values differ. Bonuses vary between the two bridge variations both in score and in type (for example, rubber bridge awards a bonus for holding a certain combination of high cards), although some are common between the two.

A larger bonus is awarded if the declaring side makes a small slam or grand slam, a contract of 12 or 13 tricks respectively. If the declaring side is not vulnerable, a small slam gets 500 points, and a grand slam 1000 points. If the declaring side is vulnerable, a small slam is 750 points and a grand slam is 1500.

In rubber bridge, the rubber finishes when a partnership has won two games, but the partnership receiving the most "overall" points wins the rubber. Duplicate bridge is scored comparatively, meaning that the score for the hand is compared to other tables playing the same cards and match points are scored according to the comparative results: usually either "matchpoint scoring", where each partnership receives 2 (or 1) point for each pair that they beat, and 1 (or a half) point for each tie; or IMPs (international matchpoint) scoring, where the number of IMPs varies (but less than proportionately) with the points difference between the teams.

Undertricks are scored in both variations as follows:
The rules of the game are referred to as the "laws" as promulgated by various bridge organizations.

The official rules of duplicate bridge are promulgated by the <a href="World%20Bridge%20Federation">WBF</a> as the "International Code of Laws of Duplicate Bridge, 2007". The Laws Committee of the WBF, composed of world experts, updates the Laws every 10 years; it also issues a Laws Commentary advising on interpretations it has rendered.

In addition to the basic rules of play, there are many additional rules covering playing conditions and the rectification of irregularities, which are primarily for use by tournament directors who act as referees and have overall control of procedures during competitions. But various details of procedure are left to the discretion of the zonal bridge organisation for tournaments under their aegis and some (for example, the choice of "movement") to the sponsoring organisation (e.g. the club).

Some zonal organisations of the WBF also publish editions of the Laws. For example, the <a href="American%20Contract%20Bridge%20League">American Contract Bridge League (ACBL)</a> publishes the "Laws of Duplicate Bridge" and additional documentation for club and tournament directors.

There are no universally accepted rules for rubber bridge, but some zonal organisations have published their own. An example for those wishing to abide by a published standard is "The Laws of Rubber Bridge" as published by the <a href="American%20Contract%20Bridge%20League">American Contract Bridge League</a>.

The majority of rules mirror those of duplicate bridge in the bidding and play and differ primarily in procedures for dealing and scoring.

In 2001, the <a href="World%20Bridge%20Federation">WBF</a> promulgated a set of Laws for online play.

Bridge is a member of the family of <a href="trick-taking%20game">trick-taking game</a>s and is a development of <a href="Whist">Whist</a>, which had become the dominant such game and enjoyed a loyal following for centuries. According to the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>", "Bridge" is the <a href="English%20language">English</a> pronunciation of a game called "<a href="Biritch">Biritch</a>", which was also known as Russian Whist.

The oldest known Biritch rule book, dated 1886, is "" by John Collinson. It and his subsequent letter to "The Saturday Review" dated May 28, 1906, document the origin of "Biritch" as being the Russian community in Istanbul. It has some features in common with <a href="Solo%20Whist">Solo Whist</a>. The game had many significant bridge-like developments: dealer chose the <a href="trump%20%28cards%29">trump</a> suit, or nominated his partner to do so; there was a call of notrumps ("biritch"); dealer's partner's hand became dummy; points were scored above and below the line; game was 3NT, 4H and 5D (although 8 club odd tricks and 15 spade odd tricks were needed); the score could be doubled and redoubled; and there were slam bonuses. This game, and variants of it known as "bridge" and "bridge-whist", became popular in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1890s despite the long-established dominance of whist.

In 1904 <a href="auction%20bridge">auction bridge</a> was developed, in which the players bid in a competitive auction to decide the contract and declarer. The object became to make at least as many tricks as were contracted for, and penalties were introduced for failing to do so.

The modern game of contract bridge was the result of innovations to the scoring of auction bridge by <a href="Harold%20Stirling%20Vanderbilt">Harold Stirling Vanderbilt</a> and others. The most significant change was that only the tricks contracted for were scored below the line toward game or a slam bonus, a change that resulted in bidding becoming much more challenging and interesting. Also new was the concept of "vulnerability", making sacrifices to protect the lead in a rubber more expensive. The various <a href="bridge%20scoring">scores</a> were adjusted to produce a more balanced and interesting game. Vanderbilt set out his rules in 1925, and within a few years contract bridge had so supplanted other forms of the game that "bridge" became synonymous with "contract bridge".

In the USA and many other countries, most of the bridge played today is <a href="duplicate%20bridge">duplicate bridge</a>, which is played at clubs, in tournaments and online. The number of people playing contract bridge has declined since its peak in the 1940s, when a survey found it was played in 44% of US households. The game is still widely played, especially amongst retirees, and in 2005 the <a href="American%20Contract%20Bridge%20League">ACBL</a> estimated there were 25 million players in the US.

Bridge is a game of skill played with <a href="random">random</a>ly dealt cards, which makes it also a <a href="game%20of%20chance">game of chance</a>, or more exactly, a tactical game with inbuilt randomness, imperfect knowledge and restricted communication. The chance element is in the deal of the cards; in duplicate bridge some of the chance element is eliminated by comparing results of multiple pairs in identical situations. This is achievable when there are eight or more players, sitting at two or more tables, and the deals from each table are preserved and passed to the next table, thereby "duplicating" them for the other table(s) of players. At the end of a session, the scores for each deal are compared, and the most points are awarded to the players doing the best with each particular deal. This measures skill (but still with a significant element of luck) because each pair or team is being judged only on the ability to bid with, and play, the same cards as other players. However very often even the most skillful play will only succeed some of the time, and the skilled player may be unlucky because an alternative, less expert play achieves a better result. But in the long run the expert player will score better.

Duplicate bridge is played in clubs and tournaments, which can gather as many as several hundred players. Duplicate bridge is a <a href="mind%20sport">mind sport</a>, and its popularity gradually became comparable to that of <a href="chess">chess</a>, with which it is often compared for its complexity and the mental skills required for high-level competition. Bridge and chess are the only "mind sports" recognized by the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a>, although they were not found eligible for the main <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic</a> program.

The basic premise of duplicate bridge had previously been used for whist matches as early as 1857. Initially, bridge was not thought to be suitable for duplicate competition; it was not until the 1920s that (auction) bridge tournaments became popular.

In 1925 when contract bridge first evolved, bridge tournaments were becoming popular, but the rules were somewhat in flux, and several different organizing bodies were involved in tournament sponsorship: the <a href="American%20Bridge%20League">American Bridge League</a> (formerly the "American Auction Bridge League", which changed its name in 1929), the <a href="American%20Whist%20League">American Whist League</a>, and the <a href="United%20States%20Bridge%20Association">United States Bridge Association</a>. In 1935, the first officially recognized world championship was held. By 1937, however, the <a href="American%20Contract%20Bridge%20League">American Contract Bridge League (ACBL)</a> had come to power (a union of the ABL and the USBA), and it remains the sanctioning body for <a href="North%20American%20Bridge%20Championships">bridge tournaments</a> in North America. In 1958, the <a href="World%20Bridge%20Federation">World Bridge Federation (WBF)</a> was founded to promote bridge worldwide, coordinate periodic revision to the Laws (each ten years, next in 2017) and conduct world championships.

In tournaments, "<a href="bidding%20box">bidding box</a>es" are frequently used, as noted above. These avoid the possibility of players at other tables hearing any spoken bids. The bidding cards are laid out in sequence as the auction progresses. Although it is not a formal rule, many clubs adopt a protocol that the bidding cards stay revealed until the first playing card is tabled, after which point the bidding cards are put away.

In top national and international events, "<a href="screen%20%28bridge%29">bidding screens</a>" are used. These are placed diagonally across the table, preventing partners from seeing each other during the game; often the screen is removed after the auction is complete.

Much of the complexity in bridge arises from the difficulty of arriving at a good final contract in the auction (or deciding to let the opponents declare the contract). This is a difficult problem: the two players in a partnership must try to communicate enough information about their hands to arrive at a makeable contract, but the information they can exchange is restricted – information may be passed only by the calls made and later by the cards played, not by other means; in addition, the agreed-upon meaning of each call and play must be available to the opponents.

Since a partnership that has freedom to bid gradually at leisure can exchange more information, and since a partnership that can interfere with the opponents' bidding (as by raising the bidding level rapidly) can cause difficulties for their opponents, bidding systems are both informational and strategic. It is this mixture of information exchange and evaluation, deduction, and tactics that is at the heart of bidding in bridge.

A number of basic <a href="rule%20of%20thumb">rules of thumb</a> in bridge bidding and play are summarized as <a href="bridge%20maxims">bridge maxims</a>.

A "bidding system" is a set of partnership agreements on the meanings of bids. A partnership's bidding system is usually made up of a core system, modified and complemented by specific <a href="convention%20%28bridge%29">conventions</a> (optional customizations incorporated into the main system for handling specific bidding situations) which are pre-chosen between the partners prior to play. The line between a well-known convention and a part of a system is not always clear-cut: some bidding systems include specified conventions by default. Bidding systems can be divided into mainly natural systems such as <a href="Acol">Acol</a> and <a href="Standard%20American">Standard American</a>, and mainly artificial systems such as the <a href="Precision%20Club">Precision Club</a> and <a href="Polish%20Club">Polish Club</a>.

Calls are usually considered to be either "natural" or "conventional" (artificial). A natural call carries a meaning that reflects the call; a natural bid intuitively showing hand or suit strength based on the level or suit of the bid, and a natural double expressing that the player believes that the opposing partnership will not make their contract. By contrast, a conventional (artificial) call offers and/or asks for information by means of pre-agreed coded interpretations, in which some calls convey very specific information or requests that are not part of the natural meaning of the call. Thus in response to 4NT, a 'natural' bid of 5 would state a preference towards a diamond suit or a desire to play the contract in 5 diamonds, whereas if the partners have agreed to use the common <a href="Blackwood%20convention">Blackwood convention</a>, a bid of 5 in the same situation would say nothing about the diamond suit, but tell the partner that the hand in question contains exactly one ace.

Conventions are valuable in bridge because of the need to pass information beyond a simple like or dislike of a particular suit, and because the limited bidding space can be used more efficiently by adopting a conventional (artificial) meaning for a given call where a natural meaning would have less utility, because the information it would convey is not valuable or because the desire to convey that information would arise only rarely. The conventional meaning conveys more useful (or more frequently useful) information. There are a very large number of conventions from which players can choose; many books have been written detailing bidding conventions. Well-known conventions include <a href="Stayman">Stayman</a> (to ask the opening 1NT bidder to show any four-card major suit), <a href="Jacoby%20transfer">Jacoby transfer</a>s (a request by (usually) the weak hand for the partner to bid a particular suit first, and therefore to become the declarer), and the <a href="Blackwood%20convention">Blackwood convention</a> (to ask for information on the number of aces and kings held, used in slam bidding situations).

The term "<a href="preempt">preempt</a>" refers to a high-level tactical bid by a weak hand, relying upon a very long suit rather than high cards for tricks. Preemptive bids serve a double purpose – they allow players to indicate they are bidding on the basis of a long suit in an otherwise weak hand, which is important information to share, and they also consume substantial bidding space which prevents a possibly strong opposing pair from exchanging information on their cards. Several systems include the use of opening bids or other early bids with weak hands including long (usually six to eight card) suits at the 2, 3 or even 4 or 5 levels as preempts.

As a rule, a natural suit bid indicates a holding of at least four (or more, depending on the situation and the system) cards in that suit as an opening bid, or a lesser number when supporting partner; a natural NT bid indicates a balanced hand.

Most systems use a count of <a href="high%20card%20point">high card point</a>s as the basic evaluation of the strength of a hand, refining this by reference to shape and distribution if appropriate. In the most commonly used point count system, aces are counted as 4 points, kings as 3, queens as 2, and jacks as 1 point; therefore, the deck contains 40 points. In addition, the "distribution" of the cards in a hand into suits may also contribute to the strength of a hand and be counted as <a href="point%20count">distribution points</a>. A better than average hand, containing 12 or 13 points, is usually considered sufficient to "open" the bidding, i.e., to make the first bid in the auction. A combination of two such hands (i.e., 25 or 26 points shared between partners) is often sufficient for a partnership to bid, and generally to make, game in a <a href="major%20suit">major suit</a> or notrump (more are usually needed for a <a href="minor%20suit">minor suit</a> game, as the level is higher).

In natural systems, a 1NT opening bid usually reflects a hand that has a relatively balanced shape (usually between two and four (or less often five) cards in each suit) and a sharply limited number of high card points, usually somewhere between 12 and 18 – the most common ranges use a span of exactly three points, (e.g., 12-14, 15-17 or 16-18), but some systems use a four-point range, usually 15-18.

Opening bids of three or higher are preemptive bids, i.e., bids made with weak hands that especially favor a particular suit, opened at a high level in order to define the hand's value quickly and to frustrate the opposition. For example, a hand of would be a candidate for an opening bid of 3, designed to make it difficult for the opposing team to bid and find their <a href="optimum%20contract">optimum contract</a> even if they have the bulk of the points, as it is nearly valueless unless spades are trumps, it contains good enough spades that the penalty for being set should not be higher than the value of an opponent game, and the high card weakness makes it more likely that the opponents have enough strength to make game themselves.

Openings at the 2 level are either unusually strong (2NT, natural, and 2, artificial) or preemptive, depending on the system. Unusually strong bids communicate an especially high number of points (normally 20 or more) or a high trick-taking potential (normally 8 or more).

Opening bids at the one level are made with hands containing 12–13 points or more and which are not suitable for one of the preceding bids. Using <a href="Standard%20American">Standard American</a> with <a href="Five-card%20majors">5-card majors</a>, opening hearts or spades usually promises a 5-card suit. Partnerships who agree to play 5-card majors open a <a href="minor%20suit">minor suit</a> with 4-card majors and then bid their <a href="major%20suit">major suit</a> at the next opportunity. This means that an opening bid of 1 or 1 will sometimes be made with only 3 cards in that suit.

Doubles are sometimes given conventional meanings in otherwise mostly natural systems. A natural, or "penalty" double, is one used to try to gain extra points when the defenders are confident of setting (defeating) the contract. The most common example of a conventional double is the <a href="takeout%20double">takeout double</a> of a low-level suit bid, implying support for the unbid suits or the unbid major suits and asking partner to choose one of them.

Bidding systems depart from these basic ideas in varying degrees. <a href="Standard%20American">Standard American</a>, for instance, is a collection of conventions designed to bolster the accuracy and power of these basic ideas, while Precision Club is a system that uses the 1 opening bid for all or almost all strong hands (but sets the threshold for "strong" rather lower than most other systems – usually 16 high card points) and may include other artificial calls to handle other situations (but it may contain natural calls as well). Many experts today use a system called <a href="2/1%20game%20forcing">2/1 game forcing</a> (enunciated as two over one game forcing), which amongst other features adds some complexity to the treatment of the one notrump response as used in <a href="Standard%20American">Standard American</a>. In the UK, <a href="Acol">Acol</a> is the most common system; its main features are a weak one notrump opening with 12-14 high card points and several variations for 2-level openings.

There are also a variety of advanced techniques used for hand evaluation. The most basic is <a href="point%20count">the Milton Work point count</a>, (the 4-3-2-1 system detailed above) but this is sometimes modified in various ways, or either augmented or replaced by other approaches such as <a href="losing%20trick%20count">losing trick count</a>, <a href="honor%20point%20count">honor point count</a>, <a href="law%20of%20total%20tricks">law of total tricks</a>, or <a href="Zar%20Points">Zar Points</a>.

Common conventions and variations within natural systems include:

Within play, it is also commonly agreed what systems of opening leads, signals and discards will be played:

Every call (including "pass", also sometimes called "no bid") serves two purposes. It confirms or passes some information to a partner, and also denies by implication any other kind of hand which would have tended to support an alternative call. For example, a bid of 2NT immediately after partner's 1NT not only shows a balanced hand of a certain point range, but also would almost always deny possession of a five-card major suit (otherwise the player would have bid it) or even a four card major suit (in that case, the player would probably have used the <a href="Stayman%20convention">Stayman convention</a>).

Likewise, in some partnerships the bid of 2 in the sequence 1NT - 2 - 2 - 2 between partners (opponents passing throughout) explicitly shows five hearts but also confirms four cards in spades: the bidder must hold at least five hearts to make it worth looking for a heart fit after 2 denied a four card major, and with at least five hearts, a Stayman bid must have been justified by having exactly four spades, the other major (since Stayman (as used by this partnership) is not useful with anything except a four card major suit). Thus an astute partner can read much more than the surface meaning into the bidding. Alternatively, many partnerships play this same bidding sequence as "Crawling Stayman" by which the responder shows a weak hand (less than eight high card points) with shortness in diamonds but at least four hearts and four spades; the opening bidder may correct to spades if that appears to be the better contract.

The situations detailed here are extremely simple examples; many instances of advanced bidding involve specific agreements related to very specific situations and subtle inferences regarding entire sequences of calls.

<a href="Terence%20Reese">Terence Reese</a>, a prolific author of bridge books, points out that there are only four ways of taking a trick by force, two of which are very easy:

Nearly all trick-taking techniques in bridge can be reduced to one of these four methods. The optimum play of the cards can require much thought and experience and is the subject of whole books on bridge.

The cards are dealt as shown in the bridge hand <a href="contract%20bridge%20diagram">diagram</a>; North is the dealer and starts the auction which proceeds as shown in the bidding table.
As neither North nor East have sufficient strength to "open" the bidding, they each pass, denying such strength. South, next in turn, opens with the bid of 1, which denotes a reasonable heart suit (at least 4 or 5 cards long, depending on the <a href="bidding%20system">bidding system</a>) and at least 12 <a href="hand%20evaluation">high card points</a>. On this hand, South has 14 high card points. West "<a href="overcall">overcall</a>s" with 1, since he has a long spade suit of reasonable quality and 10 high card points (an overcall can be made on a hand that is not quite strong enough for an opening bid). North "supports" partner's suit with 2, showing heart support and about points. East supports spades with 2. South inserts a "<a href="game%20try">game try</a>" of 3, "inviting" the partner to bid the "game" of 4 with good club support and overall values. North complies, as North is at the higher end of the range for his 2 bid, and has a fourth trump (the 2 bid promised only three), and the "doubleton" queen of clubs to fit with partner's strength there. (North could instead have bid 3, indicating not enough strength for game, asking South to pass and so play 3.)

In the auction, North-South are trying to investigate whether their cards are sufficient to make a game (nine tricks at notrump, ten tricks in hearts or spades, 11 tricks in clubs or diamonds), which yields bonus points if bid and made. East-West are "competing" in spades, hoping to play a contract in spades at a low level. 4 is the final contract, 10 tricks being required for N-S to make with hearts as trump.

South is the "declarer", having been first to bid hearts, and the player to South's left, West, has to choose the first card in the play, known as the "opening lead". West chooses the spade king because spades is the suit the partnership has shown strength in, and because they have agreed that when they hold two "touching honors" (or "adjacent honors") they will play the higher one first. West plays the card face down, to give their partner and the declarer (but not dummy) a chance to ask any last questions about the bidding or to object if they believe West is not the correct hand to lead. After that, North's cards are laid on the table and North becomes "dummy", as both the North and South hands will be controlled by the declarer. West turns the lead card face up, and the declarer studies the two hands to make a plan for the play. On this hand, the trump ace, a spade, and a diamond trick must be lost, so declarer must not lose a trick in clubs.

If the K is held by West, South will find it very hard to prevent it making a trick (unless West leads a club). However, there is an almost-equal chance that it is held by East, in which case it can be 'trapped' against the ace, and will be beaten, using a tactic known as a "<a href="finesse">finesse</a>".

After considering the cards, the declarer directs dummy (North) to play a small spade. East plays "low" (small card) and South takes the A, gaining the "lead". (South may also elect to "<a href="duck%20%28bridge%29">duck</a>", but for the purpose of this example, let us assume South wins the A at trick 1). South proceeds by "drawing trump", leading the K. West decides there is no benefit to holding back, and so wins the trick with the ace, and then cashes the Q. For fear of conceding a "<a href="Ruff%20%28cards%29%23%20ruff%20and%20discard">ruff and discard</a>", West plays the 2 instead of another spade. Declarer plays low from the table, and East scores the Q. Not having anything better to do, East returns the remaining trump, taken in South's hand. The trumps now accounted for, South can now execute the finesse, perhaps trapping the king as planned. South "enters" the dummy (i.e. wins a trick in the dummy's hand) by leading a low diamond, using dummy's A to win the trick, and leads the Q from dummy to the next trick. East "covers" the queen with the king, and South takes the trick with the ace, and proceeds by "cashing" the remaining "master" J. (If East doesn't play the king, then South will play a low club from South's hand and the queen will win anyway, this being the essence of the finesse). The game is now safe: South "<a href="ruff%20%28cards%29">ruffs</a>" a small club with a dummy's trump, then ruffs a diamond in hand for an "entry" back, and ruffs the last club in dummy (sometimes described as a "<a href="crossruff">crossruff</a>"). Finally, South "claims" the remaining tricks by showing his or her hand, as it now contains only high trumps and there's no need to play the hand out to prove they are all winners.

(The trick-by-trick notation used above can be also expressed in tabular form, but a textual explanation is usually preferred in practice, for reader's convenience. Plays of small cards or "discards" are often omitted from such a description, unless they were important for the outcome).

North-South score the required 10 tricks, and their opponents take the remaining three. The contract is fulfilled, and North enters the pair numbers, the contract, and the score of +420 for the winning side (North is in charge of bookkeeping in duplicate tournaments) on the <a href="traveling%20sheet">traveling sheet</a>. North asks East to check the score entered on the traveller. All players return their own cards to the board, and the next deal is played.

On the prior hand, it is quite possible that the K is held by West. For example, by swapping the K and A between the defending hands. Then the 4 contract would fail by one trick (unless West had led a club early in the play). However the failure of the contract would not mean that 4 is a bad contract on this hand. The contract depends on the club finesse working, or a mis-defense. The bonus points awarded for making a game contract far outweigh the penalty for going one off, so it is best strategy in the long run to bid game contracts such as this one.

Similarly, there is a minuscule chance that the K is in the west hand, but the west hand has no other clubs. In that case, declarer can succeed by simply cashing the A, felling the K and setting up the Q as a winner. However the chance of this is far lower than the simple chance of approximately 50% that East started with the K. Therefore, the superior "percentage" play is to take the club finesse, as described above.

After many years of little progress, <a href="computer%20bridge">computer bridge</a> made great progress at the end of the 20th century. In 1996, the <a href="American%20Contract%20Bridge%20League">ACBL</a> initiated official World Championships Computer Bridge, to be held annually along with a major bridge event. The first Computer Bridge Championship took place in 1997 at the North American Bridge Championships in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>.

Strong bridge playing programs such as Jack (World Champion in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2009), Wbridge5 (World Champion in 2005, 2007 and 2008), RoboBridge and many-time finalist Bridge Baron, would probably rank among the top few thousand human pairs worldwide. A series of articles published in 2005 and 2006 in the Dutch bridge magazine <a href="List%20of%20significant%20bridge%20books%20and%20magazines">IMP</a> describes matches between Jack and seven top Dutch pairs. A total of 196 boards were played. Overall, the program Jack lost, but by a small margin (359 versus 385 imps).

There are several free and subscription-based services available for playing bridge on the <a href="internet">internet</a>. For example:

These and other sites offer various features, such as opportunities to earn <a href="American%20Contract%20Bridge%20League">ACBL</a> masterpoints, to play in online tournaments, to compile lists of friends, and to earn money playing Bridge. Bridge Base Online also has a <a href="Vugraph">Vugraph</a> feature showing tournaments from around the world for anyone interested to watch live. As well as written commentaries from top level players, voice commentaries have been incorporated since mid-2011. Software and hardware has been tested in 2011 in order to have digital cameras recognize the cards being played, which will avoid human error or delay.

Some national contract bridge organizations now offer online bridge play to their members, including the English Bridge Union, the <a href="Dutch%20Bridge%20Federation">Dutch Bridge Federation</a> and the Australian Bridge Federation. MSN and Yahoo! Games have several online rubber bridge rooms. In 2001, the <a href="World%20Bridge%20Federation">WBF</a> issued a special edition of the lawbook adapted for internet and other electronic forms of the game.

Advantages of online play include:

There are also a number of disadvantages:

Tournaments are usually shorter online. A common length is 12 boards (deals). Online services support many simultaneous tournaments. When you finish one tournament, another will start soon.

Some online services like BBO have apps for <a href="https%3A//play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dair.com.bridgebase.BridgeBase%26amp%3Bhl%3Den">Android</a> and <a href="http%3A//itunes.com/apps/bridgebase">iPhone</a>.

Boat

A boat is a <a href="watercraft">watercraft</a> of a large range of sizes designed to float, <a href="Planing%20%28boat%29">plane</a>, <a href="boating">work or travel on water</a>. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways (e.g. <a href="river">river</a>s and <a href="lake">lake</a>s) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the <a href="whaleboat">whaleboat</a> were designed for operation from a <a href="ship">ship</a> in an offshore environment. In modern <a href="Navy">naval</a> terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). An older tradition is that a ship has a weather deck fully enclosing the hull space, while a boat lacks a full weather deck; this is suggested as the reason why submarines are referred to as 'boats' rather than 'ships', as a cylindrical hull has interior decks but no weatherdeck. Another definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as bulk freighters long on the Great Lakes are called <a href="lake%20freighter">oreboats</a>. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity.

Boats have a wide variety of shapes, sizes and construction methods due to their intended purpose, available materials or local traditions. <a href="Canoe">Canoe</a>-type boats have been used since prehistoric times and various versions are used throughout the world for transportation, fishing or sport. <a href="Fishing%20boat">Fishing boat</a>s vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. <a href="Pleasure%20boat">Pleasure boat</a>s include <a href="ski%20boat">ski boat</a>s, <a href="Pontoon%20%28boat%29">pontoon boats</a>, and <a href="sailboat">sailboat</a>s. <a href="House%20boat">House boat</a>s may be used for vacationing or long-term housing. Small boats can provide transport or convey cargo (<a href="lightering">lightering</a>) to and from large ships. <a href="Lifeboat%20%28shipboard%29">Lifeboat</a>s have rescue and safety functions. Boats can be powered by human power (e.g. <a href="rowboat">rowboat</a>s), wind power (e.g. <a href="sailboat">sailboat</a>s) and motor power (e.g. <a href="propellor">propellor</a>-driven motorboats driven by <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a> or <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel</a> engines).

Dugouts are the oldest type of boats found by archaeologists,
and boats have served as <a href="boating">transportation</a> since the earliest times. Circumstantial evidence, such as the <a href="Early%20human%20migrations%23South%20Asia%20and%20Australia">early settlement of Australia</a> over 40,000 years ago, findings in <a href="Crete">Crete</a> dated 130,000 years ago, and findings in Flores dated to 900,000 years ago, suggest that boats have been used since prehistoric times. The earliest boats are thought to have been <a href="Dugout%20%28boat%29">logboats</a>, and the oldest boats found by archaeological excavation date from around 7,000–10,000 years ago. The oldest recovered boat in the world is the <a href="Pesse%20canoe">Pesse canoe</a>, a dugout made from the hollowed tree trunk of a "<a href="Pinus%20sylvestris">Pinus sylvestris</a>" and constructed somewhere between 8200 and 7600 BC. This <a href="canoe">canoe</a> is exhibited in the Drents Museum in Assen, Netherlands. Other very old dugout boats have also been recovered.
Rafts have operated for at least 8,000 years.
A 7,000-year-old seagoing <a href="reed%20boat">reed boat</a> has been found in <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>.
Boats were used between 4000 and 3000 BC in <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>, <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> and in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>.

Boats played an important role in the commerce between the <a href="Indus%20Valley%20Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a> and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Evidence of varying models of boats has also been discovered at various Indus Valley archaeological sites.
<a href="Uru%20%28boat%29">Uru</a> craft originate in <a href="Beypore">Beypore</a>, a village in south <a href="Kozhikode">Calicut</a>, <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>, in southwestern <a href="India">India</a>. This type of mammoth wooden ship was constructed using teak, without any iron, and had a transport capacity of 400 tonnes. The ancient Arabs and Greeks used such boats as trading vessels.

The historians <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> record the use of boats for commerce, travel, and military purposes.

Boats can be categorized into three main types:

Several key components make up the main structure of most boats. The <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> is the main structural component of the boat and provides buoyancy. The <a href="Gunnel%20%28ship%20element%29">gunnel</a>, which make up the sides of the boat, offers protection from water and makes the boat harder to sink. The roughly horizontal, chambered structures spanning the hull of the boat are referred to as the deck. A ship often has several decks, but a boat is unlikely to have more than one, if any. Above the deck are the <a href="Superstructure%20%28ship%29">superstructures</a>. The underside of a deck is the deck head.

An enclosed space on a boat is referred to as a cabin. Several structures make up a cabin, including a coach-roof, which is a lightweight structure which spans a raised cabin. The "floor" of a cabin is properly known as the sole, but is more likely to be called the floor (a floor is properly, a structural member which ties a frame to the keelson and keel). The vertical surfaces dividing the internal space are bulkheads.

The <a href="keel">keel</a> is a lengthwise structural member to which the frames are fixed (sometimes referred to as a "backbone").

The front (or fore end) of a boat is called the bow. Boats of earlier times often featured a <a href="Figurehead%20%28object%29">figurehead</a> protruding from the bow. The rear (or aft end) of the boat is called the stern. The right side (facing forward) is starboard and the left side is port.

Nearly every boat is given a name by the owner, and this is how the boat is referred to in the boating community, and in some cases, in legal or title paperwork. Boat names vary from whimsical to humorous to serious.

Until the mid-19th century most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although <a href="Reed%20%28plant%29">reed</a>, bark and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in Ancient Egypt, the <a href="birch%20bark">birch bark</a> <a href="canoe">canoe</a>, the animal hide-covered <a href="kayak">kayak</a> and <a href="coracle">coracle</a> and the <a href="dugout%20canoe">dugout canoe</a> made from a single log.

Bill Streever describes a boat made by the native <a href="Inupiat%20people">Inupiat people</a> in <a href="Barrow%2C%20Alaska">Barrow, Alaska</a> as "a skin boat, an "umiaq", built from the stitched hides of <a href="bearded%20seal">bearded seal</a>s and used to hunt <a href="bowhead%20whale">bowhead whale</a>s in the open-water leads during spring...".

By the mid-19th century, many boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. In 1855 ferro-cement boat construction was patented by the French, who coined the name "ferciment". This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat's hull and covered (<a href="trowell">trowell</a>ed) over with cement. Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structure, it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode. These materials and methods were copied all over the world and have faded in and out of popularity to the present time. As the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats, and the <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer process</a> (<a href="patent">patent</a>ed in 1855) cheapened the cost of steel, steel ships and boats began to be more common. By the 1930s boats built entirely of steel from frames to plating were seen replacing wooden boats in many industrial uses, also for fishing fleets. Private recreational boats of steel are however uncommon. In 1895 WH Mullins produced steel boats of galvanized iron and by 1930 became the world's largest producer of pleasure boats. Mullins also offered boats in aluminum from 1895 through 1899 and once again in the 1920's In the mid-20th century <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> gained popularity. Though much more expensive than steel, there are now aluminum alloys available that do not corrode in salt water, and an aluminium boat built to similar load carrying standards is lighter in weight than the steel equivalent .
Around the mid-1960s, boats made of <a href="glass-reinforced%20plastic">glass-reinforced plastic</a>, more commonly known as <a href="fibreglass">fibreglass</a>, became popular, especially for recreational boats. The <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> refers to such boats as 'FRP' (for fibre-reinforced plastic) boats.

Fibreglass boats are strong, and do not rust (iron oxide), corrode, or rot. They are, however susceptible to structural degradation from sunlight and extremes in temperature over their lifespan. Fibreglass provides structural strength, especially when long woven strands are laid, sometimes from bow to stern, and then soaked in epoxy or polyester resin to form the hull. Whether hand laid or built in a mould, <a href="Fibre-reinforced%20plastic">Fibre-reinforced plastic</a> (FRP) boats usually have an outer coating of <a href="gelcoat">gelcoat</a>, which is a thin solid colored layer of polyester resin that adds no structural strength, but does create a smooth surface which can be buffed to a high shine and also acts as a protective layer against sunlight. FRP structures can be made stiffer with sandwich panels, where the FRP encloses a lightweight core such as balsa or foam. Cored FRP is most often found in decking, which helps keep down weight that will be carried above the waterline. The addition of wood makes the cored structure of the boat susceptible to rotting, which puts a greater emphasis on not allowing damaged sandwich structures to go unrepaired. Plastic based foam cores are less vulnerable. The phrase 'advanced composites' in FRP construction may indicate the addition of carbon fibre, <a href="Kevlar">Kevlar</a> or other similar materials, but it may also indicate methods designed to introduce less expensive and, by at least one <a href="yacht">yacht</a> surveyor's eyewitness accounts, less structurally sound materials.

Cold moulding is similar to FRP in as much as it involves the use of epoxy or polyester resins, but the structural component is wood instead of fibreglass. In cold moulding very thin strips of wood are layered over a form or mould. Each layer is coated with resin and another directionally alternating layer is laid on top. In some processes the subsequent layers are stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous layers, but in other processes the layers are weighted or even vacuum bagged to hold them together while the resin sets. Layers are built up until the required hull thickness is achieved.

Boats or watercraft have also been made of materials such as <a href="Extruded%20polystyrene">foam</a> or plastic, but most homebuilts today are built of plywood and either painted or covered with a layer of fibreglass and resin.

The most common means of boat propulsion are as follows:

An early, uncommon means of boat propulsion is represented by the <a href="water%20caterpillar">water caterpillar</a>. This boat was moved by a series of paddles on chains along the bottom to propel it over the water and preceded the development of <a href="tracked%20vehicle">tracked vehicle</a>s.

A floating boat <a href="displacement%20%28fluid%29">displaces</a> its weight in water. The material of the boat hull may be denser than water, but if this is the case then it forms only the outer layer. If the boat floats, the mass of the boat (plus contents) "as a whole" divided by the volume "below the waterline" is equal to the <a href="density">density</a> of water (1 kg/l). If weight is added to the boat, the volume below the waterline will increase to keep the weight balance equal, and so the boat sinks a little to compensate.

The blood cells are mainly <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s (also called WBCs or leukocytes) and <a href="platelet">platelet</a>s (also called thrombocytes). The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this <a href="Breath">respiratory</a> gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a> ion transported in plasma.

Vertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. Some animals, such as <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s, use <a href="hemocyanin">hemocyanin</a> to carry oxygen, instead of hemoglobin. <a href="Insect">Insect</a>s and some mollusks use a fluid called <a href="hemolymph">hemolymph</a> instead of blood, the difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a>. In most insects, this "blood" does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies are small enough for their <a href="invertebrate%20trachea">tracheal system</a> to suffice for supplying oxygen.

<a href="Gnathostomata">Jawed vertebrates</a> have an <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">adaptive immune system</a>, based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the <a href="Coagulation">clotting</a> of blood. <a href="Arthropod">Arthropod</a>s, using hemolymph, have <a href="hemocyte">hemocyte</a>s as part of their <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>.

Blood is circulated around the body through <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s by the pumping action of the <a href="heart">heart</a>. In animals with <a href="lung">lung</a>s, <a href="artery">arterial</a> blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and <a href="vein">venous</a> blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled.

Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato- (<a href="American%20and%20British%20English%20spelling%20differences%23Simplification%20of%20ae%20and%20oe">also spelled</a> haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word ("haima") for "blood". In terms of <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a> and <a href="histology">histology</a>, blood is considered a specialized form of <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a>, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of <a href="fibrinogen">fibrinogen</a>.

Blood performs many important functions within the body, including:

Blood accounts for 7% of the human body weight, with an average density around 1060 kg/m, very close to pure water's density of 1000 kg/m. The average adult has a <a href="blood%20volume">blood volume</a> of roughly , which is composed of plasma and several kinds of cells. These blood cells (which are also called corpuscles or "formed elements") consist of erythrocytes (<a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s, RBCs), leukocytes (<a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s), and thrombocytes (<a href="platelet">platelet</a>s). By volume, the red blood cells constitute about 45% of whole blood, the plasma about 54.3%, and white cells about 0.7%.

Whole blood (plasma and cells) exhibits <a href="non-Newtonian%20fluid">non-Newtonian</a> <a href="Blood%20viscosity">fluid dynamics</a>. If all human hemoglobin were free in the plasma rather than being contained in RBCs, the circulatory fluid would be too viscous for the cardiovascular system to function effectively.

One microliter of blood contains:

About 55% of blood is <a href="blood%20plasma">blood plasma</a>, a fluid that is the blood's liquid medium, which by itself is straw-yellow in color. The blood plasma volume totals of 2.7–3.0 liters (2.8–3.2 quarts) in an average human. It is essentially an <a href="water">aqueous</a> solution containing 92% water, 8% blood plasma <a href="protein">protein</a>s, and trace amounts of other materials. Plasma circulates dissolved nutrients, such as <a href="glucose">glucose</a>, <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, and <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins), and removes waste products, such as <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="urea">urea</a>, and <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a>.

Other important <a href="List%20of%20human%20blood%20components">components</a> include:

The term serum refers to plasma from which the clotting proteins have been removed. Most of the proteins remaining are albumin and <a href="antibody">immunoglobulins</a>.

<a href="pH%23Living%20systems">Blood pH</a> is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a>. Blood that has a pH below 7.35 is too <a href="acid">acid</a>ic, whereas blood pH above 7.45 is too basic. Blood pH, <a href="Oxygen%23partial%20pressure">partial pressure of oxygen (pO)</a>, <a href="PCO2">partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO)</a>, and <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a> (HCO) are carefully regulated by a number of <a href="homeostasis">homeostatic mechanisms</a>, which exert their influence principally through the <a href="respiratory%20system">respiratory system</a> and the <a href="urinary%20system">urinary system</a> to control the <a href="Acid-base%20homeostasis">acid-base balance</a> and respiration. An <a href="arterial%20blood%20gas%20test">arterial blood gas test</a> measures these. Plasma also circulates <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s transmitting their messages to various tissues. The list of normal <a href="Reference%20ranges%20for%20blood%20tests">reference ranges</a> for various blood electrolytes is extensive.

Human blood is typical of that of mammals, although the precise details concerning cell numbers, size, <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a>, and so on, vary somewhat between species. In non-mammalian vertebrates, however, there are some key differences:

Blood is circulated around the body through <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s by the pumping action of the <a href="heart">heart</a>. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong <a href="left%20ventricle">left ventricle</a> of the heart through <a href="artery">arteries</a> to peripheral <a href="Tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> and returns to the right <a href="Atrium%20%28heart%29">atrium of the heart</a> through <a href="vein">vein</a>s. It then enters the right <a href="Ventricle%20%28heart%29">ventricle</a> and is pumped through the <a href="pulmonary%20artery">pulmonary artery</a> to the <a href="lung">lung</a>s and returns to the left atrium through the <a href="pulmonary%20vein">pulmonary vein</a>s. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and <a href="venous%20blood">venous blood</a> carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> by <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a>, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.

Additional return flow may be generated by the movement of <a href="skeletal%20muscle">skeletal muscle</a>s, which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the <a href="right%20atrium">right atrium</a>.

The blood circulation was famously described by <a href="William%20Harvey">William Harvey</a> in 1628.

In vertebrates, the various cells of blood are made in the <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a> in a process called <a href="hematopoiesis">hematopoiesis</a>, which includes <a href="erythropoiesis">erythropoiesis</a>, the production of red blood cells; and <a href="myelopoiesis">myelopoiesis</a>, the production of white blood cells and platelets. During childhood, almost every human bone produces red blood cells; as adults, red blood cell production is limited to the larger bones: the bodies of the vertebrae, the breastbone (sternum), the ribcage, the pelvic bones, and the bones of the upper arms and legs. In addition, during childhood, the <a href="thymus">thymus</a> gland, found in the <a href="mediastinum">mediastinum</a>, is an important source of <a href="T%20lymphocytes">T lymphocytes</a>. There are recent reports that the lungs may also be the site of hematopoiesis.
The proteinaceous component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced predominantly by the <a href="liver">liver</a>, while hormones are produced by the <a href="endocrine%20gland">endocrine gland</a>s and the watery fraction is regulated by the <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a> and maintained by the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>.

Healthy <a href="erythrocytes">erythrocytes</a> have a plasma life of about 120 days before they are degraded by the <a href="spleen">spleen</a>, and the <a href="Kupffer%20cell">Kupffer cell</a>s in the liver. The liver also clears some proteins, lipids, and amino acids. The kidney actively secretes waste products into the <a href="urine">urine</a>.

About 98.5% of the <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at sea-level pressure is chemically combined with the <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in <a href="mammals">mammals</a> and many other species (for exceptions, see below). Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity between 1.36 and 1.40 ml O per gram hemoglobin, which increases the total <a href="blood%20oxygen%20capacity">blood oxygen capacity</a> seventyfold, compared to if oxygen solely were carried by its solubility of 0.03 ml O per liter blood per mm Hg partial pressure of oxygen (about 100 mm Hg in arteries).

With the exception of pulmonary and <a href="Umbilical%20artery">umbilical arteries</a> and their corresponding veins, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and deliver it to the body via <a href="arteriole">arteriole</a>s and <a href="capillary">capillaries</a>, where the oxygen is consumed; afterwards, <a href="venule">venule</a>s and veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.

Under normal conditions in adult humans at rest, hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98–99% saturated with oxygen, achieving an oxygen delivery between 950 and 1150 ml/min to the body. In a healthy adult at rest, oxygen consumption is approximately 200–250 ml/min, and deoxygenated blood returning to the lungs is still roughly 75% (70 to 78%) saturated. Increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions. Oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia). Sustained hypoxia (oxygenation less than 90%), is dangerous to health, and severe hypoxia (saturations less than 30%) may be rapidly fatal.

A <a href="fetus">fetus</a>, receiving oxygen via the <a href="placenta">placenta</a>, is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found in an adult's lungs), so fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (<a href="Fetal%20hemoglobin">hemoglobin F</a>) to function under these conditions.

CO is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood). Most of it (about 70%) is converted to bicarbonate ions by the enzyme <a href="carbonic%20anhydrase">carbonic anhydrase</a> in the red blood cells by the reaction CO + HO → HCO → H + ; about 7% is dissolved in the plasma; and about 23% is bound to hemoglobin as <a href="carbamino">carbamino</a> compounds.
Hemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the CO bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of <a href="allosteric%20regulation">allosteric</a> effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. The decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the <a href="Haldane%20effect">Haldane effect</a>, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. A rise in the partial pressure of CO or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the <a href="Bohr%20effect">Bohr effect</a>.

Some oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin.

In mammals, blood is in equilibrium with <a href="lymph">lymph</a>, which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by capillary ultrafiltration. Lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the <a href="thoracic%20duct">thoracic duct</a>, which drains into the left <a href="subclavian%20vein">subclavian vein</a> where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation.

Blood circulation transports heat throughout the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g., during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss. In contrast, when the external temperature is low, blood flow to the extremities and surface of the skin is reduced and to prevent heat loss and is circulated to the important organs of the body, preferentially.

Rate of blood flow varies greatly between different tissues. Liver has the most abundant blood supply with approximate blood flow of 1350ml/min. Kidney and Brain are the second and the third most supplied tissues, with 1100 ml/min and ~700ml/min, respectively.

If the rate of blood flow per 100g of tissue be the criterion, these gradings will be completely different. With kidney, adrenal gland and thyroid being the first, second and third most supplied tissues, respectively.

The restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement, resulting in an <a href="erection">erection</a> of that tissue; examples are the <a href="erectile%20tissue">erectile tissue</a> in the <a href="penis">penis</a> and <a href="clitoris">clitoris</a>.

Another example of a hydraulic function is the <a href="jumping%20spider">jumping spider</a>, in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump, without the need for bulky muscular legs.

In insects, the blood (more properly called <a href="hemolymph">hemolymph</a>) is not involved in the transport of oxygen. (Openings called <a href="Trachea%23Invertebrates">tracheae</a> allow oxygen from the air to diffuse directly to the tissues.) Insect blood moves nutrients to the tissues and removes waste products in an open system.

Other invertebrates use respiratory proteins to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin is the most common respiratory protein found in nature. <a href="Hemocyanin">Hemocyanin</a> (blue) contains copper and is found in <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and <a href="Mollusca">mollusks</a>. It is thought that <a href="tunicate">tunicate</a>s (sea squirts) might use <a href="vanabins">vanabins</a> (proteins containing <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a>) for <a href="respiratory%20pigment">respiratory pigment</a> (bright-green, blue, or orange).

In many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying proteins are freely soluble in the blood; in vertebrates they are contained in specialized red blood cells, allowing for a higher concentration of respiratory pigments without increasing <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> or damaging blood filtering organs like the kidneys.

<a href="Giant%20tube%20worm">Giant tube worm</a>s have unusual hemoglobins that allow them to live in extraordinary environments. These hemoglobins also carry sulfides normally fatal in other animals.

The coloring matter of blood (hemochrome) is largely due to the protein in the blood responsible for oxygen transport. Different groups of organisms use different proteins.

Hemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood in vertebrates. Each molecule has four heme groups, and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact color. In <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s and other hemoglobin-using creatures, arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red, as oxygen imparts a strong red color to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during <a href="blood%20donation">blood donation</a> and when venous blood samples are taken. This is because the spectrum of light absorbed by hemoglobin differs between the oxygenated and deoxygenated states.

Blood in <a href="carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">carbon monoxide poisoning</a> is bright red, because <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> causes the formation of <a href="carboxyhemoglobin">carboxyhemoglobin</a>. In <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> poisoning, the body cannot utilize oxygen, so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. There are some conditions affecting the heme groups present in hemoglobin that can make the skin appear blue—a symptom called <a href="cyanosis">cyanosis</a>. If the heme is oxidized, <a href="methemoglobin">methemoglobin</a>, which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the rare condition <a href="sulfhemoglobinemia">sulfhemoglobinemia</a>, arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark red with a bluish hue.

Veins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. However, the factors that contribute to this alteration of <a href="visual%20perception">color perception</a> are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the <a href="visual%20cortex">visual cortex</a>, rather than the actual color of the venous blood.

<a href="Skink">Skink</a>s in the genus "<a href="Prasinohaema">Prasinohaema</a>" have green blood due to a buildup of the waste product <a href="biliverdin">biliverdin</a>.

The blood of most <a href="mollusks">mollusks</a> – including <a href="cephalopods">cephalopods</a> and <a href="gastropods">gastropods</a> – as well as some <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, such as <a href="horseshoe%20crab">horseshoe crab</a>s, is blue, as it contains the copper-containing protein hemocyanin at concentrations of about 50 grams per liter. Hemocyanin is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated. The blood in the circulation of these creatures, which generally live in cold environments with low oxygen tensions, is grey-white to pale yellow, and it turns dark blue when exposed to the oxygen in the air, as seen when they bleed. This is due to change in color of hemocyanin when it is oxidized. Hemocyanin carries oxygen in <a href="extracellular%20fluid">extracellular fluid</a>, which is in contrast to the intracellular oxygen transport in mammals by hemoglobin in RBCs.

The blood of most <a href="annelid">annelid</a> worms and some marine <a href="polychaetes">polychaetes</a> use chlorocruorin to transport oxygen. It is green in color in dilute solutions.

Hemerythrin is used for oxygen transport in the marine invertebrates <a href="sipunculid">sipunculid</a>s, <a href="priapulid">priapulid</a>s, <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s, and the annelid worm, magelona. Hemerythrin is violet-pink when oxygenated.

The blood of some species of <a href="Ascidiacea">ascidians</a> and tunicates, also known as sea squirts, contains proteins called vanadins. These proteins are based on vanadium, and give the creatures a concentration of vanadium in their bodies 100 times higher than the surrounding sea water. Unlike hemocyanin and hemoglobin, hemovanadin is not an oxygen carrier. When exposed to oxygen, however, vanadins turn a mustard yellow.



Substances other than oxygen can bind to hemoglobin; in some cases this can cause irreversible damage to the body. Carbon monoxide, for example, is extremely dangerous when carried to the blood via the lungs by inhalation, because carbon monoxide irreversibly binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, so that less hemoglobin is free to bind oxygen, and fewer oxygen molecules can be transported throughout the blood. This can cause suffocation insidiously. A fire burning in an enclosed room with poor ventilation presents a very dangerous hazard, since it can create a build-up of carbon monoxide in the air. Some carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin when smoking tobacco.

Blood for transfusion is obtained from human donors by blood donation and stored in a <a href="blood%20bank">blood bank</a>. There are many different <a href="blood%20type">blood type</a>s in humans, the <a href="ABO%20blood%20group%20system">ABO blood group system</a>, and the <a href="Rhesus%20blood%20group%20system">Rhesus blood group system</a> being the most important. Transfusion of blood of an incompatible blood group may cause severe, often fatal, complications, so <a href="crossmatching">crossmatching</a> is done to ensure that a compatible blood product is transfused.

Other blood products administered <a href="intravenous">intravenous</a>ly are platelets, blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, and specific coagulation factor concentrates.

Many forms of medication (from <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s to <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>) are administered intravenously, as they are not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract.

After severe acute blood loss, liquid preparations, generically known as plasma expanders, can be given intravenously, either solutions of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl etc.) at physiological concentrations, or colloidal solutions, such as dextrans, <a href="human%20serum%20albumin">human serum albumin</a>, or fresh frozen plasma. In these emergency situations, a plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.

In modern <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-based medicine</a>, bloodletting is used in management of a few rare diseases, including <a href="hemochromatosis">hemochromatosis</a> and <a href="polycythemia">polycythemia</a>. However, <a href="bloodletting">bloodletting</a> and <a href="Hirudotherapy">leeching</a> were common unvalidated interventions used until the 19th century, as many diseases were incorrectly thought to be due to an excess of blood, according to <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocratic</a> medicine.

According to the "Oxford English Dictionary", the word "blood" dates to the oldest English, circa 1000 CE. The word is derived from Middle English, which is derived from the Old English word "blôd", which is akin to the Old High German word "bluot", meaning blood. The modern German word is "(das) Blut."

<a href="F%C3%A5hr%C3%A6us">Fåhræus</a> (a Swedish physician who devised the <a href="erythrocyte%20sedimentation%20rate">erythrocyte sedimentation rate</a>) suggested that the Ancient Greek system of <a href="humorism">humorism</a>, wherein the body was thought to contain four distinct bodily fluids (associated with different temperaments), were based upon the observation of blood clotting in a transparent container. When blood is drawn in a glass container and left undisturbed for about an hour, four different layers can be seen. A dark clot forms at the bottom (the "black bile"). Above the clot is a layer of red blood cells (the "blood"). Above this is a whitish layer of white blood cells (the "phlegm"). The top layer is clear yellow serum (the "yellow bile").

The ABO blood group system was discovered in the year 1900 by <a href="Karl%20Landsteiner">Karl Landsteiner</a>. <a href="Jan%20Jansk%C3%BD">Jan Janský</a> is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types (A, B, AB, and O) in 1907, which remains in use today. In 1907 the first <a href="blood%20transfusion">blood transfusion</a> was performed that used the ABO system to predict compatibility. The first non-direct transfusion was performed on March 27, 1914. The Rhesus factor was discovered in 1937.

Due to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships through birth/parentage; to be "related by blood" is to be related by ancestry or descendence, rather than marriage. This bears closely to <a href="bloodline">bloodline</a>s, and sayings such as "<a href="blood%20is%20thicker%20than%20water">blood is thicker than water</a>" and "<a href="wikt%3Abad%20blood">bad blood</a>", as well as "<a href="Blood%20brother">Blood brother</a>".

Blood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions, because <a href="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 17:11 says "the life of a creature is in the blood." This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off.

Mythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the life-giving nature of blood, seen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death.

In many <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">indigenous Australian Aboriginal peoples'</a> traditions, <a href="ochre">ochre</a> (particularly red) and blood, both high in iron content and considered <a href="Maban">Maban</a>, are applied to the bodies of dancers for ritual. As Lawlor states:
In many Aboriginal rituals and ceremonies, red ochre is rubbed all over the naked bodies of the dancers. In secret, sacred male ceremonies, blood extracted from the veins of the participant's arms is exchanged and rubbed on their bodies. Red ochre is used in similar ways in less-secret ceremonies. Blood is also used to fasten the feathers of birds onto people's bodies. Bird feathers contain a protein that is highly magnetically sensitive. Lawlor comments that blood employed in this fashion is held by these peoples to attune the dancers to the invisible energetic realm of the Dreamtime. Lawlor then connects these invisible energetic realms and <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s, because iron is <a href="magnetism">magnetic</a>.

Among the <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic tribes</a>, blood was used during their sacrifices; the "<a href="Bl%C3%B3t">Blót</a>s". The blood was considered to have the power of its originator, and, after the butchering, the blood was sprinkled on the walls, on the statues of the gods, and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling blood was called "blóedsian" in <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a>, and the terminology was borrowed by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> becoming "to bless" and "blessing". The <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite</a> word for blood, "ishar" was a cognate to words for "oath" and "bond", see <a href="Ishara">Ishara</a>.
The <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greeks</a> believed that the blood of the gods, "<a href="ichor">ichor</a>", was a substance that was poisonous to mortals.

As a relic of Germanic Law, the <a href="cruentation">cruentation</a>, an ordeal where the corpse of the victim was supposed to start bleeding in the presence of the murderer, was used until the early 17th century.

In <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> 9:4, God prohibited <a href="Noah">Noah</a> and his sons from eating blood (see <a href="Noahide%20Law">Noahide Law</a>). This command continued to be observed by the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a>.

It is also found in the Bible that when the Angel of Death came around to the Hebrew house that the first-born child would not die if the angel saw lamb's blood wiped across the doorway.

At the <a href="Council%20of%20Jerusalem">Council of Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="apostles">apostles</a> prohibited certain Christians from consuming blood—this is documented in Acts 15:20 and 29. This chapter specifies a reason (especially in verses 19–21): It was to avoid offending Jews who had become Christians, because the Mosaic Law Code prohibited the practice.

Christ's blood is the means for the <a href="Atonement%20in%20Christianity">atonement</a> of sins. Also, ″… the blood of Jesus Christ his [God] Son cleanseth us from all sin." (1 John 1:7), “… Unto him [God] that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood." (Revelation 1:5), and "And they overcame him (Satan) by the blood
of the Lamb [Jesus the Christ], and by the word of their testimony …” (Revelation 12:11).

Some Christian churches, including Roman Catholicism, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodoxy</a>, <a href="Oriental%20Orthodoxy">Oriental Orthodoxy</a>, and the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> teach that, when consecrated, the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>ic wine <a href="transubstantiation">actually becomes</a> the <a href="Blood%20of%20Christ">blood of Jesus</a> for worshippers to drink. Thus in the consecrated wine, Jesus becomes spiritually and physically present. This teaching is rooted in <a href="the%20Last%20Supper">the Last Supper</a>, as written in the four gospels of the Bible, in which Jesus stated to his <a href="Twelve%20Apostles">disciples</a> that the bread that they ate was his body, and the wine was his blood. ""This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you." ()".

Most forms of Protestantism, especially those of a <a href="Wesleyanism">Wesleyan</a> or <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> lineage, teach that the wine is no more than a symbol of the blood of Christ, who is spiritually but not physically present. <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> theology teaches that the body and blood is <a href="consubstantiation">present together "in, with, and under"</a> the bread and wine of the Eucharistic feast.

In <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, animal blood may not be consumed even in the smallest quantity (Leviticus 3:17 and elsewhere); this is reflected in Jewish <a href="diet%20%28nutrition%29">dietary</a> laws (<a href="Kashrut">Kashrut</a>). Blood is purged from meat by rinsing and soaking in water (to loosen clots), <a href="salting%20%28food%29">salting</a> and then rinsing with water again several times. Eggs must also be checked and any blood spots removed before consumption. Although blood from fish is biblically kosher, it is rabbinically forbidden to consume fish blood to avoid the appearance of breaking the Biblical prohibition.

Another ritual involving blood involves the covering of the blood of <a href="fowl">fowl</a> and <a href="Game%20%28food%29">game</a> after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13); the reason given by the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> is: "Because the life of the animal is [in] its blood" (ibid 17:14). In relation to human beings, <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> expounds on this verse that the <a href="animal%20soul">animal soul</a> of a person is in the blood, and that physical desires stem from it.

Likewise, the mystical reason for salting temple sacrifices and slaughtered meat is to remove the blood of animal-like passions from the person. By removing the animal's blood, the animal energies and life-force contained in the blood are removed, making the meat fit for human consumption.

Consumption of food containing blood is forbidden by <a href="Islamic%20dietary%20laws">Islamic dietary laws</a>. This is derived from the statement in the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a>, sura <a href="Al-Ma%27ida">Al-Ma'ida</a> (5:3): "Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah."

Blood is considered unclean, hence there are specific methods to obtain physical and ritual status of cleanliness once bleeding has occurred. Specific rules and prohibitions apply to <a href="menstruation">menstruation</a>, postnatal bleeding and irregular vaginal bleeding. When an animal has been slaughtered, the animal's neck is cut in a way to ensure that the spine is not severed, hence the brain may send commands to the heart to pump blood to it for oxygen. In this way, blood is removed from the body, and the meat is generally now safe to cook and eat. In modern times, blood transfusions are generally not considered against the rules.

Based on their interpretation of scriptures such as Acts 15:28, 29 ("Keep abstaining...from blood."), many <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> neither consume blood nor accept transfusions of whole blood or its major components: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (thrombocytes), and plasma. Members may personally decide whether they will accept medical procedures that involve their own blood or substances that are further fractionated from the four major components.

In <a href="East%20Asian%20cultural%20sphere">south East Asian popular culture</a>, it is often said that if a man's nose produces a small flow of blood, he is experiencing sexual desire. This often appears in Chinese-language and Hong Kong films as well as in <a href="Culture%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> and <a href="Culture%20of%20Korea">Korean</a> culture parodied in <a href="anime">anime</a>, <a href="manga">manga</a>, and <a href="Korean%20drama">drama</a>. Characters, mostly males, will often be shown with a <a href="epistaxis">nosebleed</a> if they have just seen someone <a href="nude">nude</a> or in little clothing, or if they have had an erotic thought or fantasy; this is based on the idea that a male's blood pressure will spike dramatically when aroused.

<a href="Vampire">Vampire</a>s are mythical creatures that drink blood directly for sustenance, usually with a preference for human blood. Cultures all over the world have myths of this kind; for example the '<a href="Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a>' legend, a human who achieves damnation and immortality by drinking the blood of others, originates from Eastern European folklore. <a href="Ticks">Ticks</a>, <a href="leech">leech</a>es, female <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es, <a href="vampire%20bat">vampire bat</a>s, and an assortment of other natural creatures do consume the blood of other animals, but only bats are associated with vampires. This has no relation to vampire bats, which are <a href="new%20world">new world</a> creatures discovered well after the origins of the European myths.

<a href="Blood%20residue">Blood residue</a> can help <a href="forensic">forensic</a> investigators identify weapons, reconstruct a criminal action, and link suspects to the crime. Through <a href="bloodstain%20pattern%20analysis">bloodstain pattern analysis</a>, forensic information can also be gained from the spatial distribution of bloodstains.

Blood residue analysis is also a technique used in <a href="archeology">archeology</a>.

Blood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art. In particular, the performances of <a href="Viennese%20Actionism">Viennese Actionist</a> <a href="Hermann%20Nitsch">Hermann Nitsch</a>, <a href="Istvan%20Kantor">Istvan Kantor</a>, <a href="Franko%20B">Franko B</a>, <a href="Lennie%20Lee">Lennie Lee</a>, <a href="Ron%20Athey">Ron Athey</a>, <a href="Yang%20Zhichao">Yang Zhichao</a>, Lucas Abela and <a href="Kira%20O%27%20Reilly">Kira O' Reilly</a>, along with the photography of <a href="Andres%20Serrano">Andres Serrano</a>, have incorporated blood as a prominent visual element. <a href="Marc%20Quinn">Marc Quinn</a> has made sculptures using frozen blood, including a cast of his own head made using his own blood.

The term "blood" is used in <a href="Genealogy">genealogical circles</a> to refer to one's <a href="Ancestor">ancestry</a>, <a href="Human%20evolution">origins</a>, and <a href="Ethnic%20group">ethnic background</a> as in the word "<a href="Heredity">bloodline</a>".

Benoit Mandelbrot

Benoit B.  Mandelbrot  (20 November 1924 – 14 October 2010) was a Polish-born, French and American <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> with broad interests in the practical sciences, especially regarding what he labeled as "the art of <a href="Benoit%20Mandelbrot%23Fractals%20and%20the%20.22theory%20of%20roughness.22">roughness</a>" of physical phenomena and "the uncontrolled element in life." He referred to himself as a "fractalist". He is recognized for his contribution to the field of <a href="fractal%20geometry">fractal geometry</a>, which included coining the word "fractal", as well as developing a theory of "roughness and <a href="self-similarity">self-similarity</a>" in nature.

In 1936, while he was a child, Mandelbrot's family migrated to France. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> ended, Mandelbrot studied mathematics, graduating from universities in Paris and the United States and receiving a master's degree in <a href="aeronautics">aeronautics</a> from the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>. He spent most of his career in both the United States and France, having <a href="Multiple%20citizenship">dual</a> <a href="French%20nationality%20law">French</a> and <a href="United%20States%20nationality%20law%23Dual%20citizenship">American</a> citizenship. In 1958, he began a 35-year career at <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, where he became an <a href="IBM%20Fellow">IBM Fellow</a>, and periodically took leaves of absence to teach at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences.

Because of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovering the <a href="Mandelbrot%20set">Mandelbrot set</a> in 1979. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be "rough", a "mess" or "chaotic", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a "degree of order." His math and geometry-centered research career included contributions to such fields as <a href="statistical%20physics">statistical physics</a>, <a href="meteorology">meteorology</a>, <a href="hydrology">hydrology</a>, <a href="geomorphology">geomorphology</a>, <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a>, <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a>, <a href="neurology">neurology</a>, <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a>, <a href="information%20technology">information technology</a>, <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a>, <a href="economics">economics</a>, <a href="geology">geology</a>, <a href="medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="physical%20cosmology">physical cosmology</a>, <a href="engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="chaos%20theory">chaos theory</a>, <a href="econophysics">econophysics</a>, <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a> and the <a href="social%20science">social science</a>s.

Toward the end of his career, he was <a href="Sterling%20Professor">Sterling Professor</a> of Mathematical Sciences at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, where he was the oldest professor in Yale's history to receive tenure. Mandelbrot also held positions at the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest%20National%20Laboratory">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>, <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20Lille%20Nord%20de%20France">Université Lille Nord de France</a>, <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> and <a href="Centre%20National%20de%20la%20Recherche%20Scientifique">Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</a>. During his career, he received over 15 honorary doctorates and served on many science journals, along with winning numerous awards. His autobiography, "The Fractalist: Memoir of a Scientific Maverick", was published in 2012.

Mandelbrot was born in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> during the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a>. His family was <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>. Although his father made his living trading clothing, the family had a strong academic tradition and his mother was a dental surgeon. He was first introduced to mathematics by two of his uncles, one of whom, <a href="Szolem%20Mandelbrojt">Szolem Mandelbrojt</a>, was a mathematician who resided in Paris. According to Mandelbrot's autobiography, "The Fractalist - Memoir of a Scientific Maverick", "[t]he love of his [Szolem's] mind was mathematics".

The family emigrated from Poland to France in 1936, when he was 11. "The fact that my parents, as economic and political refugees, joined Szolem in France saved our lives," he writes. Mandelbrot attended the Lycée Rolin in Paris until the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, when his family then moved to <a href="Tulle">Tulle</a>, France. He was helped by <a href="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> <a href="David%20Feuerwerker">David Feuerwerker</a>, the Rabbi of <a href="Brive-la-Gaillarde">Brive-la-Gaillarde</a>, to continue his studies. Much of France was occupied by the Nazis at the time, and Mandelbrot recalls this period:

In 1944, Mandelbrot returned to Paris, studied at the <a href="Lyc%C3%A9e%20du%20Parc">Lycée du Parc</a> in <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>, and in 1945 to 1947 attended the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a>, where he studied under <a href="Gaston%20Julia">Gaston Julia</a> and <a href="Paul%20L%C3%A9vy%20%28mathematician%29">Paul Lévy</a>. From 1947 to 1949 he studied at <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>, where he earned a master's degree in <a href="aeronautics">aeronautics</a>. Returning to France, he obtained his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">PhD degree</a> in Mathematical Sciences at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> in 1952.

From 1949 to 1958, Mandelbrot was a staff member at the <a href="Centre%20National%20de%20la%20Recherche%20Scientifique">Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</a>. During this time he spent a year at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>, where he was sponsored by <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a>. In 1955 he married Aliette Kagan and moved to <a href="Geneva%2C%20Switzerland">Geneva, Switzerland</a>, and later to the <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20Lille%20Nord%20de%20France">Université Lille Nord de France</a>. In 1958 the couple moved to the United States where Mandelbrot joined the research staff at the <a href="International%20Business%20Machines">IBM</a> <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Watson%20Research%20Center">Thomas J. Watson Research Center</a> in <a href="Yorktown%20Heights%2C%20New%20York">Yorktown Heights, New York</a>. He remained at IBM for 35 years, becoming an <a href="IBM%20Fellow">IBM Fellow</a>, and later Fellow <a href="Emeritus">Emeritus</a>.
From 1951 onward, Mandelbrot worked on problems and published papers not only in mathematics but in applied fields such as <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, economics, and <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a>.

Mandelbrot found that price changes in <a href="financial%20market">financial market</a>s did not follow a <a href="Gaussian%20distribution">Gaussian distribution</a>, but rather <a href="Paul%20L%C3%A9vy%20%28mathematician%29">Lévy</a> <a href="stable%20distributions">stable distributions</a> having theoretically infinite <a href="variance">variance</a>. He found, for example, that cotton prices followed a Lévy stable distribution with parameter α equal to 1.7 rather than 2 as in a Gaussian distribution. "Stable" distributions have the property that the sum of many instances of a random variable follows the same distribution but with a larger <a href="scale%20parameter">scale parameter</a>.

As a visiting professor at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, Mandelbrot began to study fractals called <a href="Julia%20set">Julia set</a>s that were invariant under certain transformations of the <a href="complex%20plane">complex plane</a>. Building on previous work by <a href="Gaston%20Julia">Gaston Julia</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Fatou">Pierre Fatou</a>, Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the <a href="Mandelbrot%20set">Mandelbrot set</a> fractal that is now named after him. In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in "<a href="The%20Fractal%20Geometry%20of%20Nature">The Fractal Geometry of Nature</a>". This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as "<a href="Artifact%20%28observational%29">program artifacts</a>".

In 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term "<a href="fractal">fractal</a>" to describe these structures and first published his ideas, and later translated, "Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension". According to mathematics scientist <a href="Stephen%20Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>, the book was a "breakthrough" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically "apply fairly straightforward mathematics … to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before." Wolfram adds that as a result of this new research, he was no longer a "wandering scientist", and later called him "the father of fractals":

Wolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition, "in which smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other, so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the whole. Fern leaves and Romanesco broccoli are two examples from nature." He points out an unexpected conclusion:

Mandelbrot used the term "fractal" as it derived from the Latin word "fractus", defined as broken or shattered glass. Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphic computer code, images that an interviewer described as looking like "the delirious exuberance of the 1960s <a href="psychedelic%20art">psychedelic art</a> with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body." He also saw himself as a "would-be Kepler", after the 17th-century scientist <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>, who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.
Mandelbrot, however, never felt he was inventing a new idea. He describes his feelings in a documentary with science writer Arthur C. Clarke:

According to Clarke, "the <a href="Mandelbrot%20set">Mandelbrot set</a> is indeed one of the most astonishing discoveries in the entire history of mathematics. Who could have dreamed that such an incredibly simple equation could have generated images of literally "infinite" complexity?" Clarke also notes an "odd coincidence:" "the name Mandelbrot, and the word "<a href="mandala">mandala</a>"—for a religious symbol—which I'm sure is a pure coincidence, but indeed the Mandelbrot set does seem to contain an enormous number of mandalas."

Mandelbrot left <a href="IBM">IBM</a> in 1987, after 35 years and 12 days, when IBM decided to end pure research in his division. He joined the Department of Mathematics at <a href="Yale">Yale</a>, and obtained his first <a href="tenure">tenure</a>d post in 1999, at the age of 75. At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences.

Mandelbrot created the first-ever "theory of roughness", and he saw "roughness" in the shapes of mountains, <a href="coastline">coastline</a>s and <a href="river%20basin">river basin</a>s; the structures of plants, <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s and <a href="lung">lung</a>s; the clustering of <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a>. His personal quest was to create some mathematical formula to measure the overall "roughness" of such objects in nature. He began by asking himself various kinds of questions related to nature:
In his paper entitled <a href="How%20Long%20Is%20the%20Coast%20of%20Britain%3F%20Statistical%20Self-Similarity%20and%20Fractional%20Dimension">How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension</a> published in <a href="Science%20%28journal%29">"Science"</a> in 1967 Mandelbrot discusses <a href="self-similarity">self-similar</a> curves that have <a href="Hausdorff%20dimension">Hausdorff dimension</a> that are examples of "<a href="fractal">fractal</a>s", although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975. The paper is one of Mandelbrot's first publications on the topic of fractals.

Mandelbrot emphasized the use of fractals as realistic and useful models for describing many "rough" phenomena in the real world. He concluded that "real roughness is often fractal and can be measured." Although Mandelbrot coined the term "<a href="fractal">fractal</a>", some of the mathematical objects he presented in "<a href="The%20Fractal%20Geometry%20of%20Nature">The Fractal Geometry of Nature</a>" had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, "rough" objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:

Fractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and <a href="stock%20market">stock market</a> prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">Euclidean geometry</a>: Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.  —Mandelbrot, in his introduction to "<a href="The%20Fractal%20Geometry%20of%20Nature">The Fractal Geometry of Nature</a>"

Mandelbrot has been called a visionary and a maverick. His informal and passionate style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition (supported by the inclusion of numerous illustrations) made "The Fractal Geometry of Nature" accessible to non-specialists. The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to <a href="chaos%20theory">chaos theory</a> and other fields of science and mathematics.

Mandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of <a href="Olbers%27%20paradox">Olbers' paradox</a> (the "dark night sky" riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a <a href="Necessity%20and%20sufficiency">sufficient, but not necessary</a>, resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the <a href="star">star</a>s in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like <a href="Cantor%20dust">Cantor dust</a>), it would not be necessary to rely on the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a> theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.

Mandelbrot's awards include the <a href="Wolf%20Prize">Wolf Prize</a> for Physics in 1993, the <a href="Lewis%20Fry%20Richardson">Lewis Fry Richardson</a> Prize of the <a href="European%20Geophysical%20Society">European Geophysical Society</a> in 2000, the <a href="Japan%20Prize">Japan Prize</a> in 2003, and the Einstein Lectureship of the <a href="American%20Mathematical%20Society">American Mathematical Society</a> in 2006.

The small asteroid <a href="27500%20Mandelbrot">27500 Mandelbrot</a> was named in his honor. In November 1990, he was made a Knight in the French <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>. In December 2005, Mandelbrot was appointed to the position of Battelle Fellow at the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest%20National%20Laboratory">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>. Mandelbrot was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in January 2006. An honorary degree from <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> was bestowed on Mandelbrot in the May 2010 commencement exercises.

A partial list of awards received by Mandelbrot:

Mandelbrot died from <a href="pancreatic%20cancer">pancreatic cancer</a> at the age of 85 in a <a href="hospice">hospice</a> in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> on 14 October 2010. Reacting to news of his death, mathematician <a href="Heinz-Otto%20Peitgen">Heinz-Otto Peitgen</a> said: "[I]f we talk about impact inside mathematics, and applications in the sciences, he is one of the most important figures of the last fifty years."

<a href="Chris%20Anderson%20%28entrepreneur%29">Chris Anderson</a>, <a href="TED%20%28conference%29">TED conference</a> curator, described Mandelbrot as "an icon who changed how we see the world". <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, <a href="President%20of%20France">President of France</a> at the time of Mandelbrot's death, said Mandelbrot had "a powerful, original mind that never shied away from innovating and shattering preconceived notions [… h]is work, developed entirely outside mainstream research, led to modern information theory." Mandelbrot's obituary in "The Economist" points out his fame as "celebrity beyond the academy" and lauds him as the "father of fractal geometry".

Best-selling essayist-author <a href="Nassim%20Nicholas%20Taleb">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>, a Mandelbrot protégé and a scientific adviser at <a href="Mark%20Spitznagel">Universa Investments</a>, has remarked that Mandelbrot's book "The (Mis)Behavior of Markets" is in his opinion "The deepest and most realistic finance book ever published".



In 2004, the American singer-songwriter <a href="Jonathan%20Coulton">Jonathan Coulton</a> wrote "The Mandelbrot Set", a song dedicated to Mandelbrot and his famous fractal. In 2007, the author <a href="Laura%20Ruby">Laura Ruby</a> published a sequel to "The Wall and the Wing" series named "The Chaos King". One of the main characters is named Mandelbrot and his work is referenced in the novel, specifically, the <a href="chaos%20theory">chaos theory</a>.

Benedict of Nursia

Benedict of Nursia (; ; <a href="Vulgar%20Latin">Vulgar Latin</a>: "*Benedecto"; ; 2 March 480 – 543 or 547 AD) is a Christian saint, who is venerated in the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>es, the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, the <a href="Oriental%20Orthodoxy">Oriental Orthodox Churches</a>, the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> and <a href="Old%20Catholic%20Church">Old Catholic Church</a>es. He is a <a href="Patron%20saints%20of%20Europe">patron saint of Europe</a>. 

Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at <a href="Subiaco%2C%20Lazio">Subiaco, Lazio</a>, Italy (about to the east of Rome), before moving to <a href="Monte%20Cassino">Monte Cassino</a> in the mountains of <a href="southern%20Italy">southern Italy</a>. The <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Order of Saint Benedict</a> is of later origin and, moreover, not an "order" as commonly understood but merely a confederation of autonomous congregations.

Benedict's main achievement is his "<a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a>", containing <a href="precepts">precepts</a> for his monks. It is heavily influenced by the writings of <a href="John%20Cassian">John Cassian</a>, and shows strong affinity with the <a href="Rule%20of%20the%20Master">Rule of the Master</a>. But it also has a unique spirit of balance, moderation and reasonableness (ἐπιείκεια, "epieikeia"), and this persuaded most religious communities founded throughout the Middle Ages to adopt it. As a result, his Rule became one of the most influential religious rules in Western <a href="Christendom">Christendom</a>. For this reason, Benedict is often called the founder of <a href="Christian_monasticism%23Western_Christian_monasticism">Western Christian monasticism</a>.

Apart from a short poem attributed to Mark of Monte Cassino, the only ancient account of Benedict is found in the second volume of <a href="Pope%20Gregory%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Pope Gregory I</a>'s four-book "<a href="Dialogues">Dialogues</a>", thought to have been written in 593. The authenticity of this work has been hotly disputed, especially by Dr Francis Clarke in his two volume work "The Pseudo-Gregorian Dialogues". Book Two consists of a prologue and thirty-eight succinct chapters.

Gregory’s account of this saint’s life is not, however, a biography in the modern sense of the word. It provides instead a <a href="Hagiography">spiritual portrait</a> of the gentle, disciplined abbot. In a letter to Bishop Maximilian of Syracuse, Gregory states his intention for his "Dialogues", saying they are a kind of "floretum" (an "anthology", literally, 'flowers') of the most striking miracles of Italian holy men.

Gregory did not set out to write a chronological, historically anchored story of Saint Benedict, but he did base his anecdotes on direct testimony. To establish his authority, Gregory explains that his information came from what he considered the best sources: a handful of Benedict’s disciples who lived with the saint and witnessed his various miracles. These followers, he says, are Constantinus, who succeeded Benedict as <a href="Abbot">Abbot</a> of Monte Cassino; Valentinianus; Simplicius; and Honoratus, who was abbot of Subiaco when St Gregory wrote his "Dialogues".

In Gregory's day, history was not recognised as an independent field of study; it was a branch of grammar or rhetoric, and "historia" (defined as 'story') summed up the approach of the learned when they wrote what was, at that time, considered 'history.' Gregory’s "Dialogues" Book Two, then, an authentic medieval hagiography cast as a conversation between the Pope and his deacon Peter, is designed to teach spiritual lessons.

He was the son of a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> noble of <a href="Nursia">Nursia</a>, the modern <a href="Norcia">Norcia</a>, in <a href="Umbria">Umbria</a>. A tradition which <a href="Bede">Bede</a> accepts makes him a twin with his sister <a href="Scholastica">Scholastica</a>. If 480 is accepted as the year of his birth, the year of his abandonment of his studies and leaving home would be about 500. Saint Gregory's narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than 20 at the time. He was old enough to be in the midst of his literary studies, to understand the real meaning and worth of the dissolute and licentious lives of his companions, and to have been deeply affected by the love of a woman. He was at the beginning of life, and he had at his disposal the means to a career as a Roman noble; clearly he was not a child.

Benedict does not seem to have left Rome for the purpose of becoming a <a href="hermit">hermit</a>, but only to find some place away from the life of the great city. He took his old nurse with him as a servant and they settled down to live in <a href="Enfide">Enfide</a>. Enfide, which the tradition of Subiaco identifies with the modern <a href="Affile">Affile</a>, is in the <a href="Monti%20Simbruini">Simbruini</a> mountains, about forty miles from Rome and two from Subiaco.

A short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow, gloomy valley, penetrating the mountains and leading directly to Subiaco. The path continues to ascend, and the side of the ravine, on which it runs, becomes steeper, until a cave is reached above which the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly; while on the right, it strikes in a rapid descent down to where, in Saint Benedict's day, below, lay the blue waters of the lake. The cave has a large triangular-shaped opening and is about ten feet deep.
On his way from Enfide, Benedict met a monk, <a href="Romanus%20of%20Subiaco">Romanus of Subiaco</a>, whose monastery was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave. Romanus had discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to Subiaco, and had given him the monk's habit. By his advice Benedict became a hermit and for three years, unknown to men, lived in this cave above the lake. One day, the Devil brought before his imagination a beautiful woman he had formerly known, inflaming his heart with strong desire for her. Immediately, Benedict stripped off his clothes and rolled into a thorn-bush until his body was lacerated. Thus, through the wounds of the body, he cured the wounds of his soul.

Gregory tells us little of these years. He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth ("puer"), but as a man ("vir") of God. Romanus, he twice tells us, served the saint in every way he could. The monk apparently visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food.

During these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, Benedict matured both in mind and character, in knowledge of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the abbot of a monastery in the neighbourhood (identified by some with <a href="Vicovaro">Vicovaro</a>), the community came to him and begged him to become its abbot. Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the monastery, and knew that "their manners were diverse from his and therefore that they would never agree together: yet, at length, overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent" (ibid., 3). The experiment failed; the monks tried to poison him. The legend goes that they first tried to poison his drink. He prayed a blessing over the cup and the cup shattered. Thus he left the group and went back to his cave at Subiaco. There lived in the neighborhood a priest called Florentius who, moved by envy, tried to ruin him. He tried to poison him with poisoned bread. When he prayed a blessing over the bread, a raven swept in and took the loaf away. From this time his miracles seem to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his sanctity and character, came to Subiaco to be under his guidance. Having failed by sending him poisonous bread, Florentius tried to seduce his monks with some prostitutes. To avoid further temptations, in 530 Benedict left Subiaco. He founded 12 monasteries in the vicinity of Subiaco, and, eventually, in 530 he founded the great Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino, which lies on a hilltop between Rome and Naples.

During the invasion of Italy, <a href="Totila">Totila</a>, King of the <a href="Ostrogoths">Goths</a>, ordered a general to wear his kingly robes and to see whether Benedict would discover the truth. Immediately the Saint detected the impersonation, and Totila came to pay him due respect.

He died at <a href="Monte%20Cassino">Monte Cassino</a> not long after his sister, Saint Scholastica. Benedict died of a high fever on the day God had told him he was to die, and was buried in the same place as his sister. According to tradition, this occurred on 21 March 543 or 547. He was named patron protector of Europe by <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a> in 1964. In 1980, <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> declared him co-<a href="patron%20saint">patron</a> of Europe, together with <a href="Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius">Saints Cyril and Methodius</a>.

In the pre-1970 <a href="General%20Roman%20Calendar">General Roman Calendar</a>, his feast is kept on 21 March, the day of his death according to some manuscripts of the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" and that of <a href="Bede">Bede</a>. Because on that date his <a href="liturgy">liturgical</a> <a href="memorial%20%28liturgy%29">memorial</a> would always be impeded by the observance of <a href="Lent">Lent</a>, the <a href="Mysterii%20Paschalis">1969 revision</a> of the <a href="General%20Roman%20Calendar">General Roman Calendar</a> moved his memorial to 11 July, the date that appears in some Gallic liturgical books of the end of the 8th century as the feast commemorating his birth ("Natalis S. Benedicti"). There is some uncertainty about the origin of this feast. Accordingly, on 21 March the <a href="Roman%20Martyrology">Roman Martyrology</a> mentions in a line and a half that it is Benedict's day of death and that his memorial is celebrated on 11 July, while on 11 July it devotes seven lines to speaking of him, and mentions the tradition that he died on 21 March.

The <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> commemorates Saint Benedict on 14 March.

The <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> has no single universal calendar, but a provincial <a href="List%20of%20Anglican%20Church%20calendars">calendar of saints</a> is published in each province. In almost all of these, Saint Benedict is commemorated on 11 July.

Seventy-three short chapters comprise the "Rule". Its wisdom is of two kinds: spiritual (how to live a Christocentric life on earth) and administrative (how to run a monastery efficiently). More than half the chapters describe how to be obedient and humble, and what to do when a member of the community is not. About one-fourth regulate the work of God (the Opus Dei). One-tenth outline how, and by whom, the monastery should be managed.

Following the golden rule of "Ora et Labora - pray and work", the monks each day devoted eight hours to prayer, eight hours to sleep, and eight hours to manual work, sacred reading, or works of charity.

This medal originally came from a cross in honour of Saint Benedict. On one side, the medal has an image of Saint Benedict, holding the Holy Rule in his left hand and a cross in his right. There is a raven on one side of him, with a cup on the other side of him. Around the medal's outer margin are the words ""Eius in obitu nostro praesentia muniamur"" ("May we, at our death, be fortified by His presence"). The other side of the medal has a cross with the initials CSSML on the vertical bar which signify ""Crux Sacra Sit Mihi Lux"" ("May the Holy Cross be my light") and on the horizontal bar are the initials NDSMD which stand for ""Non Draco Sit Mihi Dux"" ("Let not the dragon be my overlord"). The initials CSPB stand for ""Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti"" ("The Cross of the Holy Father Benedict") and are located on the interior angles of the cross. Either the inscription ""PAX"" (Peace) or the <a href="Christogram">Christogram</a> ""IHS"" may be found at the top of the cross in most cases. Around the medal's margin on this side are the "<a href="Vade%20Retro%20Satana">Vade Retro Satana</a>" initials VRSNSMV which stand for ""Vade Retro Satana, Nonquam Suade Mihi Vana"" ("Begone Satan, do not suggest to me thy vanities") then a space followed by the initials SMQLIVB which signify ""Sunt Mala Quae Libas, Ipse Venena Bibas"" ("Evil are the things thou profferest, drink thou thy own poison").

This medal was first struck in 1880 to commemorate the fourteenth centenary of Saint Benedict's birth and is also called the Jubilee Medal; its exact origin, however, is unknown. In 1647, during a witchcraft trial at <a href="Natternberg">Natternberg</a> near <a href="Metten%20Abbey">Metten Abbey</a> in Bavaria, the accused women testified they had no power over Metten, which was under the protection of the cross. An investigation found a number of painted crosses on the walls of the abbey with the letters now found on St Benedict medals, but their meaning had been forgotten. A manuscript written in 1415 was eventually found that had a picture of Saint Benedict holding a scroll in one hand and a staff which ended in a cross in the other. On the scroll and staff were written the full words of the initials contained on the crosses. Medals then began to be struck in Germany, which then spread throughout Europe. This medal was first approved by <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIV">Pope Benedict XIV</a> in his briefs of 23 December 1741, and 12 March 1742.

Saint Benedict has been also the motive of many collector's coins around the world. The <a href="Euro%20gold%20and%20silver%20commemorative%20coins%20%28Austria%29%232002%20coinage">Austria 50 euro 'The Christian Religious Orders'</a>, issued on 13 March 2002 is one of them.

The early Middle Ages have been called "the Benedictine centuries." In April 2008, Pope <a href="Benedict%20XVI">Benedict XVI</a> discussed the influence St Benedict had on Western Europe. The pope said that "with his life and work St Benedict exercised a fundamental influence on the development of European civilization and culture" and helped Europe to emerge from the "dark night of history" that followed the fall of the <a href="Roman%20empire">Roman empire</a>.

Saint Benedict contributed more than anyone else to the rise of monasticism in the West. His Rule was the foundational document for thousands of religious communities in the Middle Ages. To this day, The Rule of St. Benedict is the most common and influential Rule used by monasteries and monks, more than 1,400 years after its writing. Today the Benedictine family is represented by two branches: the Benedictine Federation and the Cistercians.

The influence of Saint Benedict produced "a true spiritual ferment" in Europe, and over the coming decades his followers spread across the continent to establish a new cultural unity based on Christian faith.

A cathedral was built upon the birthplace of Saints Benedict and Scholastica in the 1400s. Ruins of their familial home were excavated from beneath the church and preserved. The earthquake of October 30th, 2016 completely devastated the cathedral structure, leaving only the front facade and altar standing.

Battle of Pharsalus

The Battle of Pharsalus was a decisive battle of <a href="Caesar%27s%20Civil%20War">Caesar's Civil War</a>. On 9 August 48 BC at <a href="Pharsalus">Pharsalus</a> in central Greece, <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Gaius Julius Caesar</a> and his allies formed up opposite the army of the <a href="Roman%20Republic">republic</a> under the command of <a href="Pompey">Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus</a> ("Pompey the Great"). Pompey had the backing of a majority of the <a href="Roman%20Senate">senators</a>, of whom many were <a href="optimate">optimate</a>s, and his army significantly outnumbered the veteran Caesarian legions.

The two armies confronted each other over several months of uncertainty, Caesar being in a much weaker position than Pompey.
The former found himself isolated in a hostile country with only 22,000 men and short of provisions, while on the other side of the river he was faced by Pompey with an army about twice as large in number. Pompey wanted to delay, knowing the enemy would eventually surrender from hunger and exhaustion. Pressured by the senators present and by his officers, he reluctantly engaged in battle and suffered an overwhelming defeat, ultimately fleeing the camp and his men, disguised as an ordinary citizen.

A dispute between Caesar and the "optimates" faction in the Senate of Rome culminated in Caesar marching his army on Rome and forcing Pompey, accompanied by much of the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>, to flee in 49 BC from Italy to Greece, where he could better conscript an army to face his former ally. Caesar, lacking a fleet to immediately give chase, solidified his control over the western Mediterranean – Spain specifically – before assembling ships to follow Pompey. <a href="Marcus%20Calpurnius%20Bibulus">Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus</a>, whom Pompey had appointed to command his 600-ship fleet, set up a massive blockade to prevent Caesar from crossing to Greece and to prevent any aid to Italy. Caesar, defying convention, chose to cross the Adriatic during the winter, with only half his fleet at a time. This move surprised Bibulus, and the first wave of ships managed to run the blockade easily. Now prepared, Bibulus managed to prevent any further ships from crossing, but died soon afterwards.

Caesar was now in a precarious position, holding a beachhead at <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a> with only half his army, no ability to supply his troops by sea, and limited local support, as the Greek cities were mostly loyal to Pompey. Caesar's only choice was to fortify his position, forage what supplies he could, and wait on his remaining army to attempt another crossing. Pompey by now had a massive international army; however, his troops were mostly untested raw recruits, while Caesar's troops were hardened veterans. Realizing Caesar's difficulty in keeping his troops supplied, Pompey decided to simply mirror Caesar's forces and let hunger do the fighting for him. Caesar began to despair and used every channel he could think of to pursue peace with Pompey. When this was rebuffed he made an attempt to cross back to Italy to collect his missing troops, but was turned back by a storm. Finally, <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> rallied the remaining forces in Italy, fought through the blockade and made the crossing, reinforcing Caesar's forces in both men and spirit. Now at full strength, Caesar felt confident to take the fight to Pompey.

Pompey was camped in a strong position just south of <a href="Battle%20of%20Dyrrhachium%20%2848%20BC%29">Dyrrhachium</a> with the sea to his back and surrounded by hills, making a direct assault impossible. Caesar ordered a wall to be built around Pompey's position in order to cut off water and pasture land for his horses. Pompey built a parallel wall and in between a kind of no man's land was created, with fighting comparable to the trench warfare of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a>. Ultimately the standoff was broken when a traitor in Caesar's army informed Pompey of a weakness in Caesar's wall. Pompey immediately exploited this information and forced Caesar's army into a full retreat, but ordered his army not to pursue, fearing Caesar's reputation for setting elaborate traps. This caused Caesar to remark, "Today the victory had been the enemy's, had there been any one among them to gain it." Pompey continued his strategy of mirroring Caesar's forces and avoiding any direct engagements. After trapping Caesar in <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, the prominent senators in Pompey's camp began to argue loudly for a more decisive victory. Although Pompey was strongly against it — he wanted to surround and starve Caesar's army instead — he eventually gave in and accepted battle from Caesar on a field near Pharsalus.

The date of the actual decisive battle is given as 9 August 48 BC according to the republican calendar. According to the Julian calendar however, the date was either 29 June (according to Le Verrier's chronological reconstruction) or possibly 7 June (according to Drumann/Groebe). As Pompey was assassinated on 3 September 48 BC, the battle must have taken place in the true month of August, when the harvest was becoming ripe (or Pompey's strategy of starving Caesar would not be plausible).

The location of the battlefield was for a long time the subject of controversy among scholars. Caesar himself, in his <a href="Commentarii%20de%20Bello%20Civili">Commentarii de Bello Civili</a>, mentions few place-names; and although the battle is called after Pharsalos, four ancient writers – the author of the "Bellum Alexandrinum" (48.1), <a href="Frontinus">Frontinus</a> ("Strategemata" 2.3.22), <a href="Eutropius%20%28historian%29">Eutropius</a> (20), and <a href="Orosius">Orosius</a> (6.15.27) – place it specifically at "Palae"pharsalos. <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> in his "Geographica" ("Γεωγραφικά") mentions both old and new Pharsaloi, and notes that the Thetideion, the temple to <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a> south of Scotoussa, was near both. In 198 BC, in the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a>, <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a> sacked Palaepharsalos (<a href="Livy">Livy</a>, "<a href="Ab%20Urbe%20Condita%20Libri%20%28Livy%29">Ab Urbe Condita</a>" 32.13.9), but left new Pharsalos untouched. These two details perhaps imply that the two cities were not close neighbours. Until the early 20th century, unsure of the site of Palaepharsalos, scholars followed <a href="Appian">Appian</a> (2.75) and located the battle of 48 BC south of the Enipeus or close to Pharsalos (today's <a href="Pharsala">Pharsala</a>).

The “north-bank” thesis of <a href="F.%20L.%20Lucas">F. L. Lucas</a>, based on his 1921 solo field-trip to Thessaly, is now, however, broadly accepted by historians. “A visit to the ground has only confirmed me,” Lucas wrote in 1921; “and it was interesting to find that Mr. Apostolides, son of the large local landowner, the hospitality of whose farm at Tekés I enjoyed, was convinced too that the [battle-]site was by Driskole [now Krini], for the very sound reason that neither the hills nor the river further east suit Caesar’s description.” John D. Morgan in his definitive “Palae-pharsalus – the Battle and the Town”, arguing for a site closer still to Krini, where he places Palaepharsalos, writes: “My reconstruction is similar to Lucas’s, and in fact I borrow one of his alternatives for the line of the Pompeian retreat. Lucas’s theory has been subjected to many criticisms, but has remained essentially unshaken.”

Caesar had the following legions with him:


However, all of these legions were understrength. Some only had about a thousand men at the time of Pharsalus, due partly to losses at Dyrrhachium and partly to Caesar's wish to rapidly advance with a picked body as opposed to a ponderous movement with a large army. According to his accounts, he had 80 <a href="cohort%20%28military%20unit%29">cohorts</a> on the battlefield, about 22,000 men.

In total, Caesar counted 110 complete cohorts in the Pompeian army, 11 legions consisting of about 45,000 men, although <a href="Orosius">Orosius</a>, following <a href="Livy">Livy</a> and Pollio, only counted 88 cohorts, and Hans Delbrück suggests that Caesar's count includes detachments at Dyrrachium and elsewhere, leaving only 88 cohorts in the Pompeian army.

On the Pharsalian plain, Pompey deployed his infantry in the traditional three lines of 10 men deep,thusly: Legions I and III were on the left with Pompey himself; at his center were the legions from Syria commanded by <a href="Quintus%20Caecilius%20Metellus%20Pius%20Scipio%20Nasica">Scipio</a>, and on the right, against the Enipeus River, were legions from Cilicia and Spanish auxiliaries. Pompey's cavalry, which greatly outnumbered Caesar's, were commanded by <a href="Titus%20Labienus">Labienus</a>, a brilliant cavalry commander and Caesar's old lieutenant during the <a href="Gallic%20Wars">Gallic Wars</a>. They were massed in a single body on Pompey's left flank, together with his auxiliary archers and slingers. Pompey's tactical plan was to allow Caesar's legions to charge while his own stood their ground, reasoning that the enemy would fatigue by charging the double distance, and that his own men would better withstand the <a href="pilum">pilum</a> toss while stationary. Simultaneously his cavalry would overwhelm the enemy's and then take the legions in the flank and rear — a classic <a href="hammer%20and%20anvil">hammer and anvil</a> tactic.

Caesar also deployed his men in three lines, but, being outnumbered, had to thin his ranks to a depth of only six men, in order to match the frontage presented by Pompey. His left flank, resting on the Enipeus River, consisted of his <a href="Battle%20of%20Dyrrhachium%20%2848%20BC%29">battle worn</a> IX legion supplemented by the VIII legion, these commanded by <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>. The center was commanded by <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Ahenobarbus%20%28consul%2032%20BC%29">Domitius</a> and upon his right he placed his favored X legion, giving <a href="Publius%20Cornelius%20Sulla">Sulla</a> command of this flank — Caesar himself took his stand on the right, across from Pompey. Upon seeing the disposition of Pompey's army Caesar grew discomforted, and further thinned his third line in order to form a fourth line on his right: this to counter the onslaught of the enemy cavalry, which he knew his numerically inferior cavalry could not withstand. This new line he gave detailed instructions for the role they would play, hinting that upon them would rest the fortunes of the day, and gave strict orders to his third line not to charge until specifically ordered.

There was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar. Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser <a href="Caius%20Triarius">Caius Triarius</a> believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against <a href="Pilum">pila</a> throws. Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> and <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Calvinus">Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus</a> started the advance. As Caesar's men reached near throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge; Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided.

As Pompey's infantry fought, <a href="Labienus">Labienus</a> ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry. Caesar then revealed his hidden fourth line of infantry and surprised Pompey's cavalry charge; Caesar's men were ordered to leap up and use their <a href="Pilum">pila</a> to thrust at Pompey's cavalry instead of throwing them. Pompey's cavalry panicked and suffered hundreds of casualties. After failing to reform, the rest of the cavalry retreated to the hills, leaving the left wing of Pompey's legions exposed. Caesar then ordered in his third line, containing his most battle-hardened veterans. These broke Pompey's left wing troops, who fled the battlefield.

After routing Pompey's cavalry, Caesar threw in his last line of reserves —a move which at this point meant that the battle was more or less decided. Pompey lost the will to fight as he watched both cavalry and legions under his command break formation and flee from battle, and he retreated to his camp, leaving the rest of his troops at the centre and right flank to their own devices. He ordered the garrisoned auxiliaries to defend camp as he gathered his family, loaded up gold, and threw off his general's cloak to make a quick escape. As the rest of Pompey's army were left confused, Caesar urged his men to end the day by routing the rest of Pompey's troops and capturing the Pompeian camp. They complied with his wishes; after finishing off the remains of Pompey's men, they furiously attacked the camp walls. The Thracians and the other auxiliaries who were left in the Pompeian camp, in total seven cohorts, defended bravely, but were not able to fend off the assault.

Caesar had won his greatest victory, claiming to have only lost about 200 soldiers and 30 centurions. In his history of the war, Caesar would praise his own men's discipline and experience, and remembered each of his <a href="centurion">centurion</a>s by name. He also questioned Pompey's decision not to charge.

Pompey fled from Pharsalus to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, where he was assassinated on the order of <a href="Ptolemy%20XIII">Ptolemy XIII</a>. Ptolemy XIII sent Pompey's head to Caesar in an effort to win his favor, but instead secured him as a furious enemy. Ptolemy, advised by his regent, the eunuch <a href="Pothinus">Pothinus</a>, and his rhetoric tutor <a href="Theodotus%20of%20Chios">Theodotus of Chios</a>, had failed to take into account that Caesar was granting amnesty to a great number of those of the <a href="Optimates">senatorial</a> faction in their defeat. Even men who had been bitter enemies were allowed not only to return to Rome but to assume their previous positions in Roman society.

Pompey's assassination had deprived Caesar of his ultimate public relations moment — pardoning his most ardent rival. The Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the <a href="First%20Triumvirate">First Triumvirate</a>. The Roman Civil War, however, was not ended. Pompey's two sons, <a href="Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20%28son%20of%20Pompey%20the%20Great%29">Gnaeus Pompeius</a> and <a href="Sextus%20Pompey">Sextus Pompey</a>, and the Pompeian faction, led now by Metellus Scipio and Cato, survived and fought for their cause in the name of Pompey the Great. Caesar spent the next few years 'mopping up' remnants of the <a href="Optimates">senatorial faction</a>. After seemingly vanquishing all his enemies and bringing peace to Rome, he was assassinated in 44 BC by friends, in a conspiracy organized by <a href="Marcus%20Junius%20Brutus">Marcus Junius Brutus</a> and <a href="Gaius%20Cassius%20Longinus">Gaius Cassius Longinus</a>.

<a href="Paul%20K.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">Paul K. Davis</a> wrote that "Caesar's victory took him to the pinnacle of power, effectively ending the Republic." The battle itself did not end the civil war but it was decisive and gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy. Until then much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and his allies due to the extensive list of clients he held in all corners of the Republic. After Pompey's defeat former allies began to align themselves with Caesar as some came to believe the gods favored him, while for others it was simple self-preservation. The ancients took great stock in success as a sign of favoritism by the gods. This is especially true of success in the face of almost certain defeat — as Caesar experienced at Pharsalus. This allowed Caesar to parlay this single victory into a huge network of willing clients to better secure his hold over power and force the Optimates into near exile in search for allies to continue the fight against Caesar.

The battle gives its name to the following artistic, geographical, and business concerns:

Bigfoot

Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) is a <a href="cryptozoology">cryptid</a> which supposedly is a <a href="simian">simian</a>-like creature of <a href="Folklore%20of%20the%20United%20States">American folklore</a> that is said to inhabit forests, especially in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, <a href="Bipedalism">bipedal</a> <a href="humanoid">humanoid</a>. The term "sasquatch" is an <a href="Anglicization">Anglicized</a> derivative of the <a href="Halkomelem">Halkomelem</a> word "sásq'ets".

Scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, misidentification, and <a href="hoax">hoax</a>, rather than a living animal. They note the lack of physical evidence after centuries of investigation, despite the fact that numerous creatures would have to exist in order to maintain a breeding population. A small group of investigators are sustained in their interest by occasional new reports of sightings. Such reports are attributed to persons seeing various animals, particularly <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a>s.

Individuals claiming to have seen Bigfoot describe it as a large, hairy, muscular, bipedal ape-like creature, roughly , covered in hair described as black, dark brown, or dark reddish. Some descriptions include details such as large eyes, a pronounced <a href="Supraorbital%20ridge">brow ridge</a>, and a large, low-set forehead. The top of the head has been described as rounded and crested, similar to the <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> of the male <a href="gorilla">gorilla</a>. The creature has been reported as having a strong, unpleasant smell.

The enormous footprints for which the creature is named are claimed to be as large as long and wide. Some footprint casts have also contained claw marks, making it likely that they came from known animals, such as bears, which have five toes and claws.

Proponents of Bigfoot's existence claim that the creature is <a href="Omnivore">omnivorous</a> and mainly <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a>.

<a href="Wild%20men">Wild men</a> stories are found among the indigenous peoples of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> Coast. <a href="Anthropologist">Anthropologist</a> and <a href="cryptozoologist">cryptozoologist</a> <a href="Grover%20Krantz">Grover Krantz</a> has written that stories of the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">indigenous population</a> which can be confidently related to the Sasquatch, correspond to the areas where white Americans have reported similar sightings. According to <a href="David%20Daegling">David Daegling</a>, the legends existed before there was a single name for the creature. They differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community. Similar accounts and legends of wild men are found on every continent except <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. 

Ecologist <a href="Robert%20Michael%20Pyle">Robert Pyle</a> argues that most cultures have accounts of human-like giants in their folk history, expressing a need for "some larger-than-life creature." Each language had its own name for the creature featured in the local version of such legends. Many names meant something along the lines of "wild man" or "hairy man", although other names described common actions it was said to perform, such as eating <a href="clams">clams</a> or shaking trees. Chief Mischelle of the <a href="Nlaka%27pamux">Nlaka'pamux</a> at <a href="Lytton%2C%20British%20Columbia">Lytton, British Columbia</a> told such a story to <a href="Charles%20Hill-Tout">Charles Hill-Tout</a> in 1898; he named the creature by a <a href="Salishan">Salishan</a> variant meaning "the benign-faced-one".

Members of the <a href="Lummi">Lummi</a> tell tales about "Ts'emekwes", the local version of Bigfoot. The stories are similar to each other in the general descriptions of "Ts'emekwes", but details about the creature's diet and activities differed among various family accounts.

Some regional versions tell of more threatening creatures. The "stiyaha" or "kwi-kwiyai" were a nocturnal race. Children were warned against saying the names, lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a person—sometimes to be killed. In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the native people about "<a href="Skookum%23monsters">skoocooms</a>": a race of <a href="cannibalistic">cannibalistic</a> wildmen living on the peak of <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a> in what is now southern Washington state.

Less-menacing versions have also been recorded, such as one by Reverend <a href="Elkanah%20Walker">Elkanah Walker</a>. In 1840, Walker, a Protestant missionary, recorded stories of giants among the Native Americans living near present-day <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>. The Indians said that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole <a href="salmon">salmon</a> from the fishermen's nets.

In the 1920s Indian Agent J. W. Burns compiled local stories and published them in a series of Canadian newspaper articles: they were accounts told to him by the <a href="Sts%27Ailes%20people">Sts'Ailes people</a> of <a href="Chehalis%2C%20British%20Columbia">Chehalis</a>, and others. The Sts'Ailes maintained, as did other indigenous peoples of the region, that the Sasquatch were real. They were offended by whites telling them that the figures were legendary. According to Sts'Ailes eyewitness accounts, the Sasquatch preferred to avoid white men, and spoke the <a href="Lillooet%20language">Lillooet language</a> of the people at <a href="Port%20Douglas%2C%20British%20Columbia">Port Douglas, British Columbia</a> at the head of <a href="Harrison%20Lake">Harrison Lake</a>. These accounts were published again in 1940. 

Burns borrowed the term Sasquatch from the <a href="Halkomelem">Halkomelem</a> "sásq'ets" () and used it in his articles to describe a hypothetical single type of creature portrayed in the local stories.

The name "Bigfoot" for the creature was first recorded by European Americans in the late 19th century. <a href="Spotted%20Elk">Spotted Elk</a>, also called Chief Big Foot, was a well-known Lakota leader who was killed during the <a href="Wounded%20Knee%20Massacre">Wounded Knee Massacre</a> in 1890. Famous in his time, he may have been the namesake for two fabled bears in the West. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries at least two enormous marauding <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>s, each nicknamed "Bigfoot", were widely noted in the press. This may have inspired the common name of the ape-creature and been a matter of confusion in early stories. The first grizzly bear Bigfoot was reportedly killed near <a href="Fresno%2C%20California">Fresno, California</a> in 1895 after killing sheep for 15 years; his weight was estimated at 2,000 pounds (900 kg).
The second grizzly bear Bigfoot was active in Idaho in the 1890s and 1900s, between the Snake and Salmon rivers; it was attributed with nearly supernatural powers. 
"Nearly twice the size of an ordinary grizzly, Bigfoot for years has levied his tribute of prime steers and no one has been found brave enough or clever enough to catch or kill him. With a single blow of his giant paw he kills the largest and best animal he can find and he usually takes the pick of a herd. He makes a single meal of the animal, and it is usually a meal that would provide a camp full of men for a week, and disappears, never to return to that locality again that season."The Idaho Bigfoot was shot and killed in 1902 near Pierce City, and was credited with killing 1,000 cattle in his lifetime.

About one-third of all claims of Bigfoot sightings are located in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, with the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Most reports are considered mistakes or hoaxes, even by those researchers who say that Bigfoot exists.

As Bigfoot has become better known and a <a href="Bigfoot%20in%20popular%20culture">phenomenon in popular culture</a>, sightings have spread throughout North America. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, rural areas of the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region">Great Lakes region</a> and the <a href="Southeastern%20United%20States">Southeastern United States</a> have been sources of numerous reports of Bigfoot sightings. The debate over the legitimacy of Bigfoot sightings reached a peak in the 1970s, and Bigfoot has been regarded as the first widely popularized example of pseudoscience in American culture.

Various types of creatures have been suggested to explain both the sightings and what type of creature Bigfoot would be. The scientific community typically attributes sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification of known animals and their tracks, particularly <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a>s.

In 2007, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Game%20Commission">Pennsylvania Game Commission</a> said that the photos that the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization said showed a juvenile Bigfoot were of a bear with <a href="mange">mange</a>. Anthropologist <a href="Jeffrey%20Meldrum">Jeffrey Meldrum</a>, on the other hand, said that the limb proportions of the suspected juvenile in question were not bear-like, and said that he believed they were "more like a chimpanzee."

Both Bigfoot believers and non-believers agree that many of the reported sightings are hoaxes or misidentified animals.

Bigfoot sightings or footprints have, in some cases, been shown to be hoaxes. Author Jerome Clark argues that the <a href="Jacko%20hoax">Jacko Affair</a>, involving an 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured in British Columbia, was a hoax. Citing research by John Green, who found that several contemporary British Columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as highly dubious, Clark notes that the "Mainland Guardian" of <a href="New%20Westminster">New Westminster</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, wrote, "Absurdity is written on the face of it."

On July 14, 2005, <a href="Tom%20Biscardi">Tom Biscardi</a>, a long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and CEO of Searching for Bigfoot Inc., appeared on the "<a href="Coast%20to%20Coast%20AM">Coast to Coast AM</a>" paranormal radio show. He said that he was "98% sure that his group will be able to capture a Bigfoot which they had been tracking in the <a href="Happy%20Camp%2C%20California">Happy Camp, California</a> area." A month later, Biscardi announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured Bigfoot and was arranging a <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> event for people to see it. Biscardi appeared on "Coast to Coast AM" again a few days later to announce that there was no captive Bigfoot. Biscardi blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him, and said that the show's audience was gullible.

On July 9, 2008, <a href="Rick%20Dyer%20%28Bigfoot%29">Rick Dyer</a> and Matthew Whitton posted a video to <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>, claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate. Dyer and Whitton received $50,000 from Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. as a <a href="good%20faith">good faith</a> gesture. The story was covered by many major news networks, including <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a>, and <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News</a>. Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body was delivered in a block of ice in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team. When the contents were thawed, observers found that the hair was not real, the head was hollow, and the feet were rubber. Dyer and Whitton admitted it was a hoax after being confronted by Steve Kulls, executive director of SquatchDetective.com.

In August 2012, a man in Montana was killed by a car while perpetrating a Bigfoot hoax using a <a href="ghillie%20suit">ghillie suit</a>.

In January 2014, Rick Dyer, perpetrator of a previous Bigfoot hoax, said he had killed a Bigfoot creature in September 2012 outside San Antonio, Texas. He said he had scientific tests performed on the body, "from DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot, and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it, and now I'm proving it to the world." He said that he intended to take the body, which he had kept in a hidden location, on tour across North America in 2014. He released photos of the body and a video showing a few individuals' reactions to seeing it, but never released any of the tests or scans. He refused to disclose the test results or provide biological samples. He said that the DNA results, which were done by an undisclosed lab, could not be matched to identify any known animal. Dyer said he would reveal the body and tests on February 9,2014, at a news conference at Washington University, but he never made the test results available. After the <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> tour, the Bigfoot body was taken to <a href="Houston">Houston</a>. On March 28, 2014, Dyer admitted on his <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page that his "Bigfoot corpse" was another hoax. He had paid Chris Russel of Twisted Toy Box to manufacture the prop, which he nicknamed "Hank", from latex, foam, and camel hair. Dyer earned approximately <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US</a>$60,000 from the tour of this second fake Bigfoot corpse. He said that he did kill a Bigfoot, but did not take the real body on tour for fear that it would be stolen.

Bigfoot proponents <a href="Grover%20Krantz">Grover Krantz</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20H.%20Bourne">Geoffrey H. Bourne</a> believed that Bigfoot could be a <a href="relict%20%28biology%29">relict population</a> of "<a href="Gigantopithecus">Gigantopithecus</a>". According to Bourne, all "Gigantopithecus" fossils were found in Asia. Given that many species of animals migrated across the <a href="Beringia">Bering land bridge</a>, they believed that it was reasonable to assume that "Gigantopithecus" might have as well.

"Gigantopithecus" fossils have not been found in the Americas. The only recovered fossils are of <a href="mandible">mandible</a>s and teeth, leaving uncertainty about "Gigantopithecus's" locomotion. Krantz has argued, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible, that "<a href="Gigantopithecus">Gigantopithecus blacki</a>" could have been bipedal. However, the relevant part of the mandible is not present in any fossils. An alternative view is that "Gigantopithecus" was <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedal</a>. The "Gigantopithecus's" enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.

Matt Cartmill criticizes the "Gigantopithecus" hypothesis: 
"The trouble with this account is that "Gigantopithecus" was not a hominin and maybe not even a <a href="crown%20group">crown group</a> hominoid; yet the physical evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted <a href="hallux">hallux</a>. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that "Gigantopithecus" would have evolved these uniquely <a href="hominini">hominin</a> traits in parallel."

Bernard G. Campbell wrote: "That "Gigantopithecus" is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the Yeti of the Himalayas and the Sasquatch of the north-west American coast. But the evidence for these creatures is not convincing."

A species of "<a href="Paranthropus">Paranthropus</a>", such as "<a href="Paranthropus%20robustus">Paranthropus robustus</a>", with its gorilla-like crested skull and bipedal gait, was suggested by <a href="Primatology">primatologist</a> <a href="John%20R.%20Napier">John R. Napier</a> and anthropologist Gordon Strasenburg as a possible candidate for Bigfoot's identity, despite the fact that fossils of "Paranthropus" are found only in Africa.

Michael Rugg, of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum, presented a comparison between human, "Gigantopithecus" and "<a href="Meganthropus">Meganthropus</a>" skulls (reconstructions made by <a href="Grover%20Krantz">Grover Krantz</a>) in episodes 131 and 132 of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum Show. He favorably compares a modern tooth suspected of coming from a Bigfoot to the "Meganthropus" fossil teeth, noting the worn enamel on the <a href="occlusion%20%28dentistry%29">occlusal</a> surface. The "Meganthropus" fossils originated from Asia, and the tooth was found near Santa Cruz, California.

Some suggest <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a>, "<a href="Homo%20erectus">Homo erectus</a>", or "<a href="Homo%20heidelbergensis">Homo heidelbergensis</a>" to be the creature, but no remains of any of those species have been found in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>.

The evidence that does exist supporting the survival of such a large, prehistoric ape-like creature has been attributed to hoaxes or delusion rather than to sightings of a genuine creature. In a 1996 "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" article, Washington State zoologist John Crane said, "There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material that's clearly been fabricated has ever been presented." In addition, scientists cite the fact that Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized apes are found in the <a href="tropics">tropics</a> of Africa and Asia.

Mainstream scientists do not consider the subject of Bigfoot an area of credible science and there have been a limited number of formal scientific studies of Bigfoot.

Evidence such as the 1967 <a href="Patterson%E2%80%93Gimlin%20film">Patterson–Gimlin film</a> has provided "no supportive data of any scientific value".

As with other similar beings, climate and food supply issues would make such a creature's survival in reported habitats unlikely. Great apes have not been found in the fossil record in the Americas, and no Bigfoot remains are known to have been found. Phillips Stevens, a <a href="cultural%20anthropologist">cultural anthropologist</a> at the <a href="University%20at%20Buffalo">University at Buffalo</a>, summarized the scientific consensus as follows:
In the 1970s, when Bigfoot experts were frequently given high-profile media coverage, Mcleod writes that the scientific community generally avoided lending credence to the theories by debating them.

<a href="Ivan%20T.%20Sanderson">Ivan T. Sanderson</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Heuvelmans">Bernard Heuvelmans</a> have spent parts of their career searching for Bigfoot. Later scientists who researched the topic included <a href="Carleton%20S.%20Coon">Carleton S. Coon</a>, George Allen Agogino and <a href="William%20Charles%20Osman%20Hill">William Charles Osman Hill</a>, although they came to no definite conclusions and later drifted from this research.

Anthropologist <a href="Jeffrey%20Meldrum">Jeffrey Meldrum</a> has said that the fossil remains of an ancient giant ape called "Gigantopithecus" could turn out to be ancestors of today's commonly known Bigfoot. John Napier asserts that the scientific community's attitude towards Bigfoot stems primarily from insufficient evidence. Other scientists who have shown varying degrees of interest in the creature are <a href="Patterson%E2%80%93Gimlin%20film%23David%20J.%20Daegling%20and%20Daniel%20O.%20Schmitt">David J. Daegling</a>, <a href="George%20Schaller">George Schaller</a>, <a href="Russell%20Mittermeier">Russell Mittermeier</a>, <a href="Daris%20Swindler">Daris Swindler</a>, <a href="Esteban%20Sarmiento">Esteban Sarmiento</a>, and <a href="Carleton%20S.%20Coon">Carleton S. Coon</a>.

The first scientific study of available evidence was conducted by John Napier and published in his book, "Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality," in 1973. Napier wrote that if a conclusion is to be reached based on scant extant "'hard' evidence," science must declare "Bigfoot does not exist." However, he found it difficult to entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, "scattered over 125,000 square miles" (325,000 km²) or to dismiss all "the many hundreds" of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, "I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is cracked up to be is another matter altogether. There must be "something" in north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints."

In 1974, the <a href="National%20Wildlife%20Federation">National Wildlife Federation</a> funded a field study seeking Bigfoot evidence. No formal federation members were involved and the study made no notable discoveries.

Beginning in the late 1970s, physical anthropologist <a href="Grover%20Krantz">Grover Krantz</a> published several articles and four book-length treatments of Sasquatch. However, his work was found to contain multiple scientific failings including falling for hoaxes.

A study published in the <a href="Journal%20of%20Biogeography">Journal of Biogeography</a> in 2009 by J.D. Lozier et al. used ecological niche modeling on reported sightings of Bigfoot, using their locations to infer Bigfoot's preferred ecological parameters. They found a very close match with the ecological parameters of the <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>, "Ursus americanus". They also note that an upright bear looks much like Bigfoot's purported appearance and consider it highly improbable that two species should have very similar ecological preferences, concluding that Bigfoot sightings are likely sightings of black bears.

In the first systematic genetic analysis of 30 hair samples that were suspected to be from bigfoot, yeti, sasquatch, almasty or other anomalous primates, only one was found to be primate in origin, and that was identified as human. A joint study by the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> and <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20Cantonal%20de%20Zoologie">Lausanne's Cantonal Museum of Zoology</a> and published in the <a href="Proceedings%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20B">Proceedings of the Royal Society B</a> in 2014, the team used a previously published cleaning method to remove all surface contamination and the <a href="ribosomal">ribosomal</a> <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> 12S fragment of the sample was sequenced and then compared to <a href="GenBank">GenBank</a> to identify the species origin. The samples submitted were from different parts of the world, including the United States, Russia, the Himalayas, and Sumatra. Other than one sample of human origin, all but two are from common animals. Black and brown bear accounted for most of the samples, other animals include cow, horse, dog/wolf/coyote, sheep, goat, raccoon, porcupine, deer and tapir. The last two samples were thought to match a fossilized genetic sample of a 40,000 year old polar bear of the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epoch; however, a later study disputes this finding. In the second paper, tests identified the hairs as being from a rare type of brown bear.

After what "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" described as "a five-year study of purported Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) DNA samples," but prior to <a href="peer%20review">peer review</a> of the work, on November 24, 2012, DNA Diagnostics, a veterinary laboratory headed by <a href="veterinarian">veterinarian</a> Melba Ketchum, issued a press release claiming that they had found proof that the Sasquatch "is a human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago as a hybrid cross of modern "<a href="Homo%20sapiens">Homo sapiens</a>" with an unknown primate species." Ketchum called for this to be recognized officially, saying that "Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a 'license' to hunt, trap, or kill them." 

Failing to find a <a href="scientific%20journal">scientific journal</a> that would publish their results, Ketchum announced on February 13, 2013 that their research had been published in the "DeNovo Journal of Science". "The Huffington Post" discovered that the journal's domain had been registered anonymously only nine days before the announcement. This was the only edition of DeNovo and was listed as Volume 1, Issue 1, with its only content being the Ketchum paper.

Shortly after publication, the paper was analyzed and outlined by <a href="Sharon%20A.%20Hill">Sharon Hill</a> of <a href="Sharon%20A.%20Hill%23Doubtful%20News">Doubtful News</a> for the <a href="Committee%20for%20Skeptical%20Inquiry">Committee for Skeptical Inquiry</a>. Hill reported on the questionable journal, mismanaged DNA testing and poor quality paper, stating that "The few experienced <a href="geneticists">geneticists</a> who viewed the paper reported a dismal opinion of it noting it made little sense."

"<a href="The%20Scientist%20%28magazine%29">The Scientist</a>" magazine also analyzed the paper, reporting that:

There are several organizations dedicated to the research and investigation of Bigfoot sightings in the United States. The oldest and largest is the <a href="Bigfoot%20Field%20Researchers%20Organization">Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization</a> (BFRO). The BFRO also provides a free database to individuals and other organizations. Their website includes reports from across North America that have been investigated by researchers to determine credibility.

In February 2016, the University of New Mexico at Gallup held a two-day Bigfoot conference, at a cost of $7,000 in university funds.

In his pursuit of Bigfoot, <a href="David%20Paulides">David Paulides</a>, author of two <a href="self-published">self-published</a> books on the subject, created the research group "North America Bigfoot Search" for which he serves as director, and which Paulides says was instrumental in the genesis of the Ketchum <a href="Bigfoot%23Bigfoot%20claims">paper published in 2013</a> claiming Bigfoot was real.

Bigfoot has had a demonstrable impact as a <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a> phenomenon. It has "become entrenched in American popular culture and it is as viable an icon as Michael Jordan" with more than forty-five years having passed since reported sightings in California, and neither an animal nor "a satisfying explanation as to why folks see giant hairy men that don't exist".

When asked for her opinion of Bigfoot in a September 27, 2002, interview on <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a>'s "<a href="Science%20Friday">Science Friday</a>", <a href="Jane%20Goodall">Jane Goodall</a> said "I'm sure they exist", and later said, chuckling, "Well, I'm a romantic, so I always wanted them to exist", and finally, "You know, why isn't there a body? I can't answer that, and maybe they don't exist, but I want them to." In 2012, when asked again by the <a href="Huffington%20Post">Huffington Post</a>, Goodall said "I'm fascinated and would actually love them to exist," adding, "Of course, it's strange that there has never been a single authentic hide or hair of the Bigfoot, but I've read all the accounts."

A TV show about Sasquatch titled <a href="Finding%20Bigfoot">Finding Bigfoot</a> began airing in 2011 and rose to some popularity on <a href="Animal%20Planet">Animal Planet</a>.
