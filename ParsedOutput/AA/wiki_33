Big Bang

The Big Bang <a href="scientific%20theory">theory</a> is the prevailing <a href="physical%20cosmology">cosmological</a> <a href="Scientific%20modelling">model</a> for the <a href="universe">universe</a> from the <a href="Planck%20units%23Cosmology">earliest known periods</a> through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe <a href="metric%20expansion%20of%20space">expanded</a> from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of <a href="light%20element">light element</a>s, the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> (CMB), <a href="Large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">large scale structure</a> and <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a>. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a <a href="gravitational%20singularity">singularity</a> which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 <a href="1%2C000%2C000%2C000%20%28number%29">billion</a> years ago, which is thus considered the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s, and later simple <a href="atom">atom</a>s. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through <a href="gravity">gravity</a> in halos of <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>, eventually forming the <a href="star">star</a>s and <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a> visible today.

Since <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a> first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the <a href="Steady%20State%20theory">Steady State theory</a>, but a wide range of <a href="empirical%20evidence">empirical evidence</a> has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic <a href="redshift">redshift</a>s, <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the <a href="Accelerating%20universe">expansion of the universe is accelerating</a>, an observation attributed to <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>'s existence. The known <a href="physical%20law">physical laws of nature</a> can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to an initial state of extreme <a href="density">density</a> and <a href="temperature">temperature</a>.

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their <a href="redshift">redshift</a>s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a> (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into <a href="high-energy%20physics">high energy regimes</a>. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s to be formed included <a href="proton">proton</a>s, <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s, and <a href="electron">electron</a>s. Though simple <a href="big%20bang%20nucleosynthesis">atomic nuclei formed</a> within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first <a href="Recombination%20%28cosmology%29">electrically neutral atoms formed</a>. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, along with <a href="helium">helium</a> and traces of <a href="lithium">lithium</a>. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through <a href="gravity">gravity</a> to form <a href="star">star</a>s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either <a href="Stellar%20nucleosynthesis">within stars</a> or <a href="supernova%20nucleosynthesis">during supernovae</a>.

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">CMB</a>, <a href="Large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">large scale structure</a>, and <a href="Hubble%27s%20Law">Hubble's Law</a>. The framework for the Big Bang model relies on <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> and on simplifying assumptions such as <a href="homogeneity%20%28physics%29%23Translation%20invariance">homogeneity</a> and <a href="isotropy">isotropy</a> of space. The governing equations were formulated by <a href="Alexander%20Friedmann">Alexander Friedmann</a>, and similar solutions were worked on by <a href="Willem%20de%20Sitter">Willem de Sitter</a>. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its <a href="parametrization">parametrization</a> as the <a href="Lambda-CDM%20model">Lambda-CDM model</a> serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current "standard model" of Big Bang cosmology, <a href="Scientific%20consensus">consensus</a> is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and <a href="Observational%20cosmology">observations relevant to cosmology</a>.

Extrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an <a href="Infinity%23Physics">infinite</a> <a href="density">density</a> and temperature at a finite time in the past. This <a href="Gravitational%20singularity">singularity</a> indicates that <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> is not an adequate description of the <a href="laws%20of%20physics">laws of physics</a> in this regime. It is debated 'how closely' models based on general relativity alone can be used to extrapolate toward the singularity—certainly no closer than the end of the <a href="Planck%20epoch">Planck epoch</a>.

This primordial singularity is itself sometimes called "the Big Bang", but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase of the universe. In either case, "the Big Bang" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "birth" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a <a href="Equation%20of%20state%20%28cosmology%29">regime</a> where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the <a href="Standard%20Model">standard model of particle physics</a>) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using <a href="Type%20Ia%20supernova">Type Ia supernova</a>e and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background</a>, the time that has passed since that event — otherwise known as the "<a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>" — is 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years. The agreement of independent measurements of this age supports the <a href="Lambda-CDM%20model">ΛCDM model</a> that describes in detail the characteristics of the universe.

Despite being extremely <a href="density">dense</a> at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>—the universe did not re-collapse into a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>. This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitational collapse</a> are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as <a href="star">star</a>s, and do not apply to <a href="metric%20expansion%20of%20space">rapidly expanding space</a> such as the Big Bang.

The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled <a href="Homogeneity%20and%20heterogeneity">homogeneously</a> and <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a>ally with a very high <a href="energy%20density">energy density</a> and huge temperatures and <a href="pressure">pressure</a>s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10 seconds into the expansion, a <a href="phase%20transition">phase transition</a> caused a <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a>, during which the universe grew <a href="exponential%20growth">exponentially</a> during which time <a href="Quantum%20fluctuation">density fluctuations</a> that occurred because of the <a href="uncertainty%20principle">uncertainty principle</a> were amplified into the seeds that would later form the <a href="Structure%20formation">large-scale structure</a> of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required for the <a href="Pair%20production">production</a> of a <a href="quark%E2%80%93gluon%20plasma">quark–gluon plasma</a> as well as all other <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at <a href="Special%20relativity">relativistic</a> <a href="Relativistic%20speed">speeds</a>, and <a href="Antimatter">particle–antiparticle pairs</a> of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called <a href="baryogenesis">baryogenesis</a> violated the conservation of <a href="baryon%20number">baryon number</a>, leading to a very small excess of <a href="quark">quark</a>s and <a href="lepton">lepton</a>s over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30 million. This resulted in the predominance of <a href="matter">matter</a> over <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a> in the present universe.

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. <a href="Explicit%20symmetry%20breaking">Symmetry breaking</a> phase transitions put the <a href="fundamental%20force">fundamental force</a>s of physics and the parameters of <a href="elementary%20particles">elementary particles</a> into their present form. After about 10 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s. At about 10 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form <a href="baryon">baryon</a>s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.
After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by <a href="photon">photon</a>s (with a minor contribution from <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a> and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> and helium <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> in a process called <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.

As the universe cooled, the <a href="rest%20mass">rest mass</a> energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">radiation</a>. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>. The <a href="Biochemistry">chemistry of life</a> may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, <a href="Age%20of%20the%20universe">13.8 billion years ago</a>, during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.

Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe. The four possible types of matter are known as <a href="cold%20dark%20matter">cold dark matter</a>, <a href="warm%20dark%20matter">warm dark matter</a>, <a href="hot%20dark%20matter">hot dark matter</a>, and <a href="baryonic%20matter">baryonic matter</a>. The best measurements available, from <a href="Wilkinson%20Microwave%20Anisotropy%20Probe">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> (WMAP), show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold (warm dark matter is ruled out by early <a href="reionization">reionization</a>), and is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%. In an "extended model" which includes hot dark matter in the form of <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>s, then if the "physical baryon density" Ωh is estimated at about 0.023 (this is different from the 'baryon density' Ω expressed as a fraction of the total matter/energy density, which as noted above is about 0.046), and the corresponding cold dark matter density Ωh is about 0.11, the corresponding neutrino density Ωh is estimated to be less than 0.0062.

Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the <a href="Cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">CMB</a> imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">expansion of the universe</a> to slowly begin to accelerate.

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a> term in <a href="Einstein%27s%20field%20equation">Einstein's field equation</a>s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its <a href="equation%20of%20state%20%28cosmology%29">equation of state</a> and relationship with the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.

All of this cosmic evolution after the <a href="inflationary%20epoch">inflationary epoch</a> can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10 seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravitation</a> is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest <a href="unsolved%20problems%20in%20physics">unsolved problems in physics</a>.

The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of <a href="physical%20law">physical law</a>s and the <a href="cosmological%20principle">cosmological principle</a>. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is <a href="Homogeneous%20space">homogeneous</a> and <a href="isotropy">isotropic</a>.

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the <a href="fine%20structure%20constant">fine structure constant</a> over much of the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a> is of order 10. Also, general relativity has passed stringent <a href="tests%20of%20general%20relativity">tests</a> on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a>, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10 via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.

General relativity describes spacetime by a <a href="metric%20tensor">metric</a>, which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a <a href="coordinate%20chart">coordinate chart</a> or "grid" that is laid down over all <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be <a href="Homogeneous%20space">homogeneous</a> and <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a> on large scales, which uniquely singles out the <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric</a> (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a <a href="scale%20factor">scale factor</a>, which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a <a href="coordinate%20system">coordinate system</a> to be made, called <a href="comoving%20coordinates">comoving coordinates</a>. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their "coordinate" distance (<a href="comoving%20distance">comoving distance</a>) remains constant, the "physical" distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the <a href="scale%20factor">scale factor</a> of the universe.

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, <a href="metric%20expansion%20of%20space">space itself expands</a> with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion "in space", but rather an expansion "of space". Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.

An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of <a href="Particle%20horizon%23Particle%20horizon">particle horizons</a>. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a "past horizon" on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a "future horizon", which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">FLRW</a> model that describes our universe.

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times <a href="Big%20Bang%23Horizon%20problem">suggests</a> that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to <a href="accelerating%20universe">accelerate</a>, there is a future horizon as well.

English astronomer <a href="Fred%20Hoyle">Fred Hoyle</a> is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "<a href="steady%20state%20universe">steady state</a>" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 <a href="Vesto%20Slipher">Vesto Slipher</a> measured the first <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a> of a "<a href="spiral%20nebula">spiral nebula</a>" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was <a href="Shapley%E2%80%93Curtis%20debate">highly controversial</a> whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. Ten years later, <a href="Alexander%20Friedmann">Alexander Friedmann</a>, a <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n <a href="physical%20cosmology">cosmologist</a> and <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>, derived the <a href="Friedmann%20equations">Friedmann equations</a> from <a href="Einstein%20equation">Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity</a>, showing that the universe might be expanding in contrast to the <a href="static%20universe">static universe</a> model advocated by Einstein at that time. In 1924 Edwin Hubble's measurement of the great distance to the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other galaxies. Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a>, a Belgian physicist and <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> priest, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe.

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the <a href="cosmic%20distance%20ladder">cosmic distance ladder</a>, using the <a href="Hooker%20telescope">Hooker telescope</a> at <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a>. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a>. Lemaître had already shown that this was expected, given the <a href="cosmological%20principle">cosmological principle</a>.

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal <a href="Steady%20state%20theory">steady state</a> universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory. This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the Big Bang theory, <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a>, was a Roman Catholic priest. <a href="Arthur%20Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> agreed with <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> that the universe did not have a beginning in time, viz., that <a href="Arguments%20for%20eternity%23Argument%20from%20the%20nature%20of%20matter">matter is eternal</a>. A beginning in time was "repugnant" to him. Lemaître, however, thought thatIf the world has begun with a single <a href="Quantum%20mechanics">quantum</a>, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time.

During the 1930s other ideas were proposed as <a href="non-standard%20cosmologies">non-standard cosmologies</a> to explain Hubble's observations, including the <a href="Milne%20model">Milne model</a>, the <a href="oscillatory%20universe">oscillatory universe</a> (originally suggested by Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and <a href="Richard%20Tolman">Richard Tolman</a>) and <a href="Fritz%20Zwicky">Fritz Zwicky</a>'s <a href="tired%20light">tired light</a> hypothesis.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle's <a href="steady%20state%20model">steady state model</a>, whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lemaître's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by <a href="George%20Gamow">George Gamow</a>, who introduced <a href="big%20bang%20nucleosynthesis">big bang nucleosynthesis</a> (BBN) and whose associates, <a href="Ralph%20Alpher">Ralph Alpher</a> and <a href="Robert%20Herman">Robert Herman</a>, predicted the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">CMB</a>. Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lemaître's theory, referring to it as "this "big bang" idea" during a <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a> broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio <a href="source%20counts">source counts</a>, began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.

In 1968 and 1970 <a href="Roger%20Penrose">Roger Penrose</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>, and <a href="George%20F.%20R.%20Ellis">George F. R. Ellis</a> published papers where they showed that <a href="mathematical%20singularities">mathematical singularities</a> were an inevitable initial condition of <a href="General%20Relativity">general relativistic</a> models of the Big Bang. Then, from the 1970s to the 1990s, cosmologists worked on characterizing the features of the Big Bang universe and resolving outstanding problems. In 1981, <a href="Alan%20Guth">Alan Guth</a> made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical <a href="%23Problems">problems in the Big Bang theory</a> with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called "<a href="cosmic%20inflation">inflation</a>". Meanwhile, during these decades, two questions in <a href="observational%20cosmology">observational cosmology</a> that generated much discussion and disagreement were over the precise values of the <a href="Hubble%20Constant">Hubble Constant</a> and the matter-density of the universe (before the discovery of <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>, thought to be the key predictor for the eventual <a href="fate%20of%20the%20universe">fate of the universe</a>).

In the mid-1990s, observations of certain <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s appeared to indicate, that they were about 15 billion years old, which <a href="cosmic%20age%20problem">conflicted</a> with most then-current estimates of the age of the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a>s, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. While there still remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.

Significant progress in Big Bang cosmology has been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in <a href="telescope">telescope</a> technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as <a href="Cosmic%20Background%20Explorer">COBE</a>, the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and <a href="WMAP">WMAP</a>. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating.

The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> and the relative abundances of light elements produced by <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>. More recent evidence includes observations of <a href="galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution">galaxy formation and evolution</a>, and the distribution of <a href="large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">large-scale cosmic structures</a>, These are sometimes called the "four pillars" of the Big Bang theory.

Precise modern models of the Big Bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a> of <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>. Of these features, <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the <a href="cuspy%20halo%20problem">cuspy halo problem</a> and the <a href="dwarf%20galaxy%20problem">dwarf galaxy problem</a> of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. <a href="Inflation%20%28cosmology%29">Inflation</a> and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are currently <a href="list%20of%20unsolved%20problems%20in%20physics">unsolved problems in physics</a>.

Observations of distant galaxies and <a href="quasar">quasar</a>s show that these objects are redshifted—the <a href="light">light</a> emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a <a href="frequency%20spectrum">frequency spectrum</a> of an object and matching the <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> pattern of <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s or <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s corresponding to <a href="atom">atom</a>s of the <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s interacting with the light. These redshifts are <a href="Homogeneity%20%28physics%29">uniformly</a> isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional <a href="velocity">velocity</a> of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the <a href="cosmic%20distance%20ladder">cosmic distance ladder</a>. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:
where

<a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a>—or the universe is <a href="Metric%20expansion%20of%20space">uniformly expanding</a> everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker</a>.

The theory requires the relation "v" = "HD" to hold at all times, where "D" is the <a href="comoving%20distance">comoving distance</a>, "v" is the <a href="recessional%20velocity">recessional velocity</a>, and "v", "H", and "D" vary as the universe expands (hence we write "H" to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the <a href="observable%20universe">observable universe</a>, the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity "v". However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.

That <a href="Metric%20expansion%20of%20space">space is undergoing metric expansion</a> is shown by direct observational evidence of the <a href="Cosmological%20principle">Cosmological principle</a> and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a> and <a href="Homogeneity%20%28physics%29%23Translation%20invariance">homogeneous</a>, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

In 1964 <a href="Arno%20Penzias">Arno Penzias</a> and <a href="Robert%20Woodrow%20Wilson">Robert Wilson</a> serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the <a href="microwave">microwave</a> band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725 K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> in 1978.
The "surface of last scattering" corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after "<a href="Recombination%20%28cosmology%29">recombination</a>", the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly <a href="Thomson%20scattering">scattered</a> from free charged particles. Peaking at around , the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent.

In 1989, <a href="NASA">NASA</a> launched the <a href="Cosmic%20Background%20Explorer%20satellite">Cosmic Background Explorer satellite</a> (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the CMB frequency spectrum is an almost perfect <a href="blackbody">blackbody</a> with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726 K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255 K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10. <a href="John%20C.%20Mather">John C. Mather</a> and <a href="George%20Smoot">George Smoot</a> were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably <a href="BOOMERanG%20experiment">BOOMERanG</a>, found the <a href="shape%20of%20the%20universe">shape of the universe</a> to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.

In early 2003, the first results of the <a href="WMAP">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a> models, but are consistent with the <a href="inflation%20theory">inflation theory</a> in general. The <a href="Planck%20%28spacecraft%29">Planck</a> space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based <a href="List%20of%20cosmic%20microwave%20background%20experiments">cosmic microwave background experiments</a> are ongoing.

Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of <a href="helium-4">helium-4</a>, <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a>, deuterium, and <a href="lithium-7">lithium-7</a> in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen. The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of <a href="photon">photon</a>s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">CMB</a> fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for /, about 10 for /, about 10 for / and about 10 for /.

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for , and off by a factor of two for ; in the latter two cases there are substantial <a href="systematic%20error">systematic uncertainties</a>. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium. Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than , and in constant ratios, too.

Detailed observations of the <a href="Galaxy%20morphological%20classification">morphology</a> and <a href="Large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">distribution</a> of galaxies and <a href="quasars">quasars</a> are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as <a href="galaxy%20clusters">galaxy clusters</a> and <a href="supercluster">supercluster</a>s.

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of <a href="star%20formation">star formation</a>, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>.

The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">CMB</a> is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of <a href="stellar%20evolution">stellar evolution</a> to <a href="globular%20clusters">globular clusters</a> and through <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a> of individual <a href="Population%20II">Population II</a> stars.

The prediction that the CMB temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the <a href="Sunyaev%E2%80%93Zel%27dovich%20effect">Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect</a> in <a href="clusters%20of%20galaxies">clusters of galaxies</a> does not depend directly on redshift. Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.

Future <a href="Gravitational-wave%20observatory">gravitational waves observatories</a> might be able to detect primordial gravitational waves, relics of the early universe, up to less than a second after the Big Bang.

As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the <a href="horizon%20problem">horizon problem</a>, the <a href="magnetic%20monopole%20problem">magnetic monopole problem</a>, and the <a href="flatness%20problem">flatness problem</a> are most commonly resolved with <a href="Cosmic%20inflation">inflationary theory</a>, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.

It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the <a href="Sakharov%20conditions">Sakharov conditions</a> must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that <a href="C-symmetry">C-symmetry</a> and <a href="CP-symmetry">CP-symmetry</a> are violated and that the universe depart from <a href="thermodynamic%20equilibrium">thermodynamic equilibrium</a>. All these conditions occur in the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a>, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

Measurements of the <a href="redshift">redshift</a>–<a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> relation for <a href="type%20Ia%20supernova">type Ia supernova</a>e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been <a href="accelerating%20universe">accelerating</a> since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large <a href="equation%20of%20state%20%28cosmology%29">negative pressure</a>, dubbed "dark energy".

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the <a href="Critical%20density%20%28cosmology%29">critical density</a> of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density. Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of <a href="gravitational%20lens">gravitational lens</a>es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the <a href="large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20universe">large-scale structure</a> as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of <a href="vacuum%20energy">vacuum energy</a>, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the <a href="far%20future">far future</a> as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a> but also extending to more exotic forms of <a href="Quintessence%20%28physics%29">quintessence</a> or other modified gravity schemes. A <a href="cosmological%20constant%20problem">cosmological constant problem</a>, sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from <a href="Planck%20units">Planck units</a>.

During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal <a href="baryon">baryon</a>ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a> velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, <a href="gravitational%20lensing">gravitational lensing</a> studies, and <a href="X-ray%20astronomy">X-ray measurements</a> of galaxy clusters.

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.

Additionally, there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored <a href="cold%20dark%20matter">cold dark matter</a> model which include the <a href="dwarf%20galaxy%20problem">dwarf galaxy problem</a> and the <a href="cuspy%20halo%20problem">cuspy halo problem</a>. Alternative theories have been proposed that do not require a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold dark matter proposal in explaining all extant observations.

The <a href="horizon%20problem">horizon problem</a> results from the premise that information cannot travel <a href="faster%20than%20light">faster than light</a>. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the <a href="particle%20horizon">particle horizon</a>—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in <a href="causality%20%28physics%29">causal</a> contact. The observed isotropy of the <a href="Cosmic%20microwave%20background">CMB</a> is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by <a href="inflationary%20theory">inflationary theory</a> in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.

<a href="Heisenberg%27s%20uncertainty%20principle">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</a> predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be <a href="primordial%20fluctuations">quantum thermal fluctuations</a>, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe. Inflation predicts that the <a href="primordial%20fluctuations">primordial fluctuations</a> are nearly <a href="Scale%20invariance">scale invariant</a> and <a href="Normal%20distribution">Gaussian</a>, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before <a href="electroweak%20symmetry%20breaking">electroweak symmetry breaking</a> occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the <a href="electroweak%20vacuum">electroweak vacuum</a> since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the <a href="electroweak%20epoch">electroweak epoch</a> ended.

The <a href="magnetic%20monopole">magnetic monopole</a> objection was raised in the late 1970s. <a href="Grand%20unified%20theory">Grand unified theories</a> predicted <a href="topological%20defect">topological defect</a>s in space that would manifest as <a href="magnetic%20monopole">magnetic monopole</a>s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a>, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.

The <a href="flatness%20problem">flatness problem</a> (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric</a> (FLRW). The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial <a href="curvature">curvature</a> depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative, if its density is less than the <a href="Critical%20density%20%28cosmology%29">critical density</a>; positive, if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be "flat".

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the <a href="Planck%20time">Planck time</a>, 10 seconds, the fact that the universe has reached neither a <a href="heat%20death%20of%20the%20universe">heat death</a> nor a <a href="Big%20Crunch">Big Crunch</a> after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.

<a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a> wrote: ""Why is there something rather than nothing? The sufficient reason [...] is found in a substance which [...] is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself."" Philosopher of physics Dean Rickles has argued that numbers and mathematics (or their underlying laws) may necessarily exist. Physics may conclude that <a href="time">time</a> did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed. Some also argue that nothing cannot exist or that non-existence might never have been an option. <a href="Quantum%20fluctuation">Quantum fluctuation</a>s, or other laws of physics that may have existed at the start of the Big Bang could then create the conditions for matter to occur.

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass <a href="density">density</a> of the universe were greater than the <a href="Critical%20density%20%28cosmology%29">critical density</a>, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>s, <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s, and <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach <a href="absolute%20zero">absolute zero</a>—a <a href="Big%20Freeze">Big Freeze</a>. Moreover, if the proton were <a href="proton%20decay">unstable</a>, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting <a href="Hawking%20radiation">Hawking radiation</a>. The <a href="entropy">entropy</a> of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our <a href="event%20horizon">event horizon</a> and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a>. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called <a href="phantom%20energy">phantom energy</a> theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called <a href="Big%20Rip">Big Rip</a>.

The following is a partial list of the popular misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

"The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:" One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.

"The Big Bang was "small"": It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.

"<a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> violates <a href="Special%20relativity">special theory of relativity</a>": Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble Distance</a> recede <a href="Faster-than-light">faster than the speed of light</a>. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion "of" space, rather than "through" space.

"<a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler redshift</a> vs <a href="Cosmological%20redshift">cosmological red-shift</a>": Astronomers often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift, which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a <a href="essential%20singularity">singularity</a> at the origin of cosmic time; this <a href="infinity%23Physics">infinite</a> <a href="energy%20density">energy density</a> is regarded as impossible in <a href="experimental%20physics">physics</a>. Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the <a href="Planck%20temperature">Planck temperature</a>, and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. "(Also see <a href="Planck%20epoch">Planck epoch</a>.)"

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>.

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of <a href="cosmogony">cosmogony</a>.

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:

Proposals in the last two categories, see the Big Bang as an event in either a much larger and <a href="Roger%20Penrose%23An%20earlier%20universe">older universe</a> or in a <a href="multiverse">multiverse</a>.

As a description of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it has become one of the liveliest areas in the discourse between <a href="Relationship%20between%20religion%20and%20science">science and religion</a>. Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.

Several substyles exist, including maibock (helles bock, heller bock), a paler, more hopped version generally made for consumption at spring festivals; doppelbock (double bock), a stronger and maltier version; and eisbock, a much stronger version made by partially freezing the beer and removing the ice that forms.

Originally a dark beer, a modern bock can range from light copper to brown in colour. The style is very popular, with many examples brewed internationally.

The style known now as "bock" was a dark, malty, lightly hopped <a href="ale">ale</a> first brewed in the 14th century by German brewers in the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic</a> town of <a href="Einbeck">Einbeck</a>. The style from Einbeck was later adopted by Munich brewers in the 17th century and adapted to the new <a href="lager">lager</a> style of brewing. Due to their Bavarian accent, citizens of Munich pronounced "Einbeck" as "ein Bock" ("a <a href="billy%20goat">billy goat</a>"), and thus the beer became known as "bock". To this day, as a visual pun, a goat often appears on bock labels.

Bock is historically associated with special occasions, often religious festivals such as Christmas, Easter or Lent (the latter as ""). Bocks have a long history of being brewed and consumed by Bavarian monks as a source of nutrition during times of fasting.

<a href="Bockfest">Bockfest</a>, in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, is the longest running and largest bock beer festival in the world. The festival celebrates bock beer, the Cincinnati neighborhood of <a href="Over-the-Rhine">Over-the-Rhine</a>, the city's German heritage, and the coming of spring.

Traditional bock is a sweet, relatively strong (6.3%–7.2% by volume), lightly hopped (20-27 <a href="IBUs">IBUs</a>) lager. The beer should be clear, and colour can range from light copper to brown, with a bountiful and persistent off-white head. The aroma should be malty and toasty, possibly with hints of alcohol, but no detectable hops or fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, with low to moderate carbonation and no astringency. The taste is rich and toasty, sometimes with a bit of caramel. Again, hop presence is low to undetectable, providing just enough bitterness so that the sweetness is not cloying and the aftertaste is muted. The following commercial products are indicative of the style: <a href="Einbecker%20Brewery">Einbecker</a> Ur-Bock Dunkel, <a href="Penn%20Brewery">Pennsylvania Brewing</a> St. Nick Bock, <a href="Aass">Aass</a> Bock, <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Brewing%20Company">Great Lakes</a> Rockefeller Bock, <a href="Stegmaier%20Brewery">Stegmaier</a> Brewhouse Bock.

The maibock style, also known as helles bock or heller bock, is a <a href="helles">helles</a> lager brewed to bock strength; therefore, still as strong as traditional bock, but lighter in colour and with more hop presence. It is a fairly recent development compared to other styles of bock beers, frequently associated with springtime and the month of May. Colour can range from deep gold to light amber with a large, creamy, persistent white head, and moderate to moderately high carbonation, while alcohol content ranges from 6.3% to 7.4% by volume. The flavour is typically less malty than a traditional bock, and may be drier, hoppier, and more bitter, but still with a relatively low hop flavour, with a mild spicy or peppery quality from the hops, increased carbonation and alcohol content. The following commercial products are indicative of the style: <a href="Ayinger">Ayinger</a> Maibock, Mahr’s Bock, <a href="Hacker-Pschorr">Hacker-Pschorr</a> Hubertus Bock, Capital Maibock, Einbecker Mai-Urbock, <a href="Staatliches%20Hofbr%C3%A4uhaus%20in%20M%C3%BCnchen">Hofbräu</a> Maibock, <a href="Victory%20Brewing%20Company">Victory</a> St. Boisterous, <a href="Gordon%20Biersch">Gordon Biersch</a> Blonde Bock, <a href="Smuttynose%20Brewing%20Company">Smuttynose</a> Maibock, <a href="Old%20Dominion%20Brewing%20Company">Old Dominion Brewing Company</a> Big Thaw Bock, [Brewery 85's Quittin' Time], <a href="Rogue%20Ales">Rogue</a> Dead Guy <a href="Ale">Ale</a>, <a href="Franconia%20Brewing%20Company">Franconia Brewing Company</a> Maibock <a href="Ale">Ale</a>, Church Street maibock, and <a href="Tr%C3%B6egs%20Brewing%20Company">Tröegs</a> Cultivator.

"Doppelbock" or "double bock" is a stronger version of traditional bock that was first brewed in Munich by the Paulaner Friars, a Franciscan order founded by <a href="Francis%20of%20Paola">St. Francis of Paula</a>. Historically, doppelbock was high in alcohol and sweet, thus serving as "liquid bread" for the Friars during times of fasting, when solid food was not permitted. Today, doppelbock is still strong—ranging from 7%–12% or more by volume. It isn't clear, with color ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although head retention may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavor is very rich and malty, with toasty notes and noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16–26 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed doppelbock named their beer "Salvator" ("Savior"), which today is trademarked by <a href="Paulaner">Paulaner</a>. Brewers of modern doppelbocks often add "<a href="wikt%3A-ator">-ator</a>" to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 "-ator" doppelbock names registered with the German patent office. The following are representative examples of the style: Predator, <a href="Paulaner">Paulaner</a> Salvator, <a href="Ayinger">Ayinger</a> Celebrator, <a href="Weihenstephaner">Weihenstephaner</a> Korbinian, <a href="Andechser">Andechser</a> Doppelbock Dunkel, <a href="Spaten">Spaten</a> Optimator, <a href="Augustiner">Augustiner</a> Maximator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, <a href="Capital%20Brewery">Capital</a> Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, <a href="Eggenberg%20Castle%2C%20Vorchdorf">Eggenberg</a> Urbock 23º, <a href="Bell%27s%20brewery">Bell's</a> Consecrator, <a href="Birra%20Moretti">Moretti</a> La Rossa, <a href="Samuel%20Adams">Samuel Adams</a> Double Bock, <a href="Tr%C3%B6egs%20Brewing%20Company">Tröegs</a> Tröegenator Double Bock, Wasatch Brewery Devastator, <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Brewing%20Company">Great Lakes</a> Doppelrock, <a href="Abita%20Brewing%20Company">Abita</a> Andygator, and Wolverine State Brewing Company Predator.

Eisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the <a href="Kulmbach%20%28district%29">Kulmbach district</a> of Germany that is made by <a href="freeze%20distillation">partially freezing</a> a doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 9% to 13% by volume. It is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, head retention is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although this should not be hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The following are representative examples of the style: Kulmbacher Reichelbräu Eisbock, <a href="Schloss%20Eggenberg">Eggenberg</a>, <a href="G.%20Schneider%20%26amp%3B%20Sohn">Schneider</a> <a href="Aventinus%20%28beer%29">Aventinus</a> Eisbock, Urbock Dunkel Eisbock, <a href="Franconia%20Brewing%20Company">Franconia Brewing Company</a> Ice Bock 17%.

The strongest ice-beer is being produced by a Franconian company as well - it is called Schorschbräu and is 57% (current world record).

Weizenbock is a style of bock brewed using wheat instead of barley. It was first produced in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> in 1907 by <a href="G.%20Schneider%20%26amp%3B%20Sohn">G. Schneider & Sohn</a> and was named "<a href="Aventinus%20%28beer%29">Aventinus</a>" after a Bavarian historian. The style combines darker Munich malts and top-fermenting wheat beer yeast, brewed at the strength of a <a href="doppelbock">doppelbock</a>.

In Austria, bockbier is traditionally brewed only around Christmas and Easter, when nearly every brewery brews its own bock.

A number of bock beers are produced, including <a href="Brasserie%20d%27Achouffe">Brasserie d'Achouffe</a> Bok and "Leute Bok" from the Van Steenberge brewer, brewed since 1927. Belgium-based <a href="InBev">InBev</a> produces Artois Bock, which is exported internationally and can be found in areas where bock is not traditionally available.

Once a year <a href="Budweiser%20Budvar">Budweiser Budvar</a> brew the 7.5% Imperial with Saaz wet/green hops fresh from the farm and matured for 200 days for release in late spring.


Bock is an unusual style in the UK, but a few examples exist. The <a href="Robert%20Cains%20brewery">Robert Cains brewery</a> in Liverpool brews Cains Double Bock beer at 8% abv, and the <a href="Dark%20Star%20Brewery">Dark Star Brewery</a>, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>, produce a 5.6% abv Maibock.

<a href="Dreher%20Brewery">Dreher Brewery</a> sells a rather strong (7.3% ABV) bock beer. It is called Bak, the name for billy goat in <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a>.

A variation of bock called 'bokbier' is also brewed extensively in the Netherlands and occasionally in Belgium. Most larger Dutch breweries, such as <a href="Heineken%20International">Heineken International</a>, <a href="Grolsch">Grolsch</a>, <a href="Amstel%20Brewery">Amstel</a>, <a href="Alfa%20Brouwerij">Alfa Brouwerij</a>, <a href="Brand">Brand</a> and <a href="Dommelsch">Dommelsch</a>, market at least one variety. Also Hollands one and only Trappist brewery La Trappe seasonally brews Bokbier. Most bokbiers tend to be <a href="seasonal%20beer">seasonal beer</a>s (traditionally autumn, although there are currently also spring, summer and winter boks). Microbreweries may prefer to seasonally brew a bokbier, such as the eco-beer biobok, made in autumn by <a href="Brouwerij%20%27t%20IJ">Brouwerij 't IJ</a> in Amsterdam. The consumers' organization <a href="PINT">PINT</a> holds a bok festival every autumn at the <a href="Beurs%20van%20Berlage">Beurs van Berlage</a> in Amsterdam.

Bantu languages

The Bantu languages (), technically the Narrow Bantu languages as opposed to "Wide Bantu", a loosely defined categorization which includes other <a href="Bantoid%20languages">Bantoid languages</a>, constitute a traditional branch of the <a href="Niger%E2%80%93Congo%20languages">Niger–Congo languages</a>. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of <a href="mutual%20intelligibility">mutual intelligibility</a>, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and "<a href="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, that is, in the regions commonly known as <a href="Central%20Africa">Central Africa</a>, <a href="Southeast%20Africa">Southeast Africa</a>, and <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a>. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map).

Estimates of number of speakers of most languages vary widely, due both to the lack of accurate statistics in most developing countries and the difficulty in defining exactly where the boundaries of a language lie, particularly in the presence of a <a href="dialect%20continuum">dialect continuum</a>.

The Bantu language with the largest total number of speakers is <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>; however, the majority of its speakers know it as a <a href="second%20language">second language</a>. According to Ethnologue, there are over 180 million second-language (L2) speakers, but only about 2 million native speakers.

Other major languages include <a href="Zulu%20language">Zulu</a> with 27 million speakers (15.7 million L2) and <a href="Shona%20language">Shona</a> with about 11 million speakers (if <a href="Manyika%20dialect">Manyika</a> and <a href="Ndau%20dialect">Ndau</a> are included). Ethnologue separates the largely <a href="mutually%20intelligible">mutually intelligible</a> <a href="Kinyarwanda">Kinyarwanda</a> and <a href="Kirundi">Kirundi</a>, which, if grouped together, have 12.4 million speakers.

The Bantu languages descend from a common <a href="Proto-Bantu%20language">Proto-Bantu language</a>, which is believed to have been spoken in what is now <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> in <a href="Central%20Africa">Central Africa</a>. 
An estimated 2,500–3,000 years ago (1000 BC to 500 BC), although other sources put the start of the Bantu Expansion closer to 3000 BC, speakers of the Proto-Bantu language began a series of migrations eastward and southward, carrying agriculture with them. This <a href="Bantu%20expansion">Bantu expansion</a> came to dominate Sub-Saharan Africa east of Cameroon, an area where <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu peoples</a> now constitute nearly the entire population.

The technical term Bantu, meaning "human beings" or simply "people", was first used by <a href="Wilhelm%20Bleek">Wilhelm Bleek</a> (1827–1875), as this is reflected in many of the languages of this group. A common characteristic of Bantu languages is that they use words such as "muntu" or "mutu" for "human being" or in simplistic terms "person", and the plural prefix for human nouns starting with "mu-" (class 1) in most languages is "ba-" (class 2), thus giving "bantu" for "people". Bleek, and later <a href="Carl%20Meinhof">Carl Meinhof</a>, pursued extensive studies comparing the grammatical structures of Bantu languages.

The most widely used classification is an alphanumeric coding system developed by <a href="Malcolm%20Guthrie">Malcolm Guthrie</a> in his 1948 classification of the Bantu languages. is mainly geographic. The term 'narrow Bantu' was coined by the "Benue–Congo Working Group" to distinguish Bantu as recognized by Guthrie, from the <a href="Bantoid%20languages">Bantoid languages</a> not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie.

In recent times, the distinctiveness of Narrow Bantu as opposed to the other <a href="Southern%20Bantoid%20languages">Southern Bantoid languages</a> has been called into doubt (cf. Piron 1995, Williamson & Blench 2000, Blench 2011), but the term is still widely used. 
A coherent classification of Narrow Bantu will likely need to exclude many of the Zone A and perhaps Zone B languages. 

There is no true genealogical classification of the (Narrow) Bantu languages. Until recently most attempted classifications only considered languages that happen to fall within traditional Narrow Bantu, but there seems to be a continuum with the related languages of South Bantoid. 

At a broader level, the family is commonly split in two depending on the reflexes of proto-Bantu tone patterns: Many Bantuists group together parts of zones A through D (the extent depending on the author) as "Northwest Bantu" or "Forest Bantu", and the remainder as "Central Bantu" or "Savanna Bantu". The two groups have been described as having mirror-image tone systems: where Northwest Bantu has a high tone in a cognate, Central Bantu languages generally have a low tone, and vice versa. 

Northwest Bantu is more divergent internally than Central Bantu, and perhaps less <a href="conservative%20%28language%29">conservative</a> due to contact with non-Bantu Niger–Congo languages; Central Bantu is likely the innovative line cladistically. Northwest Bantu is clearly not a coherent family, but even for Central Bantu the evidence is lexical, with little evidence that it is a historically valid group.

Another attempt at a detailed genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 "Tervuren" proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann. However, it relies on <a href="lexicostatistics">lexicostatistics</a>, which, because of its reliance on similarity rather than <a href="synapomorphy">shared innovations</a>, may predict spurious groups of <a href="polyphyly">conservative languages that are not closely related</a>. Meanwhile, "<a href="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>" has added languages to the Guthrie classification which Guthrie overlooked, while removing the <a href="Mbam%20languages">Mbam languages</a> (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. This has been criticized for sowing confusion in one of the few unambiguous ways to distinguish Bantu languages. Nurse & Philippson (2006) evaluate many proposals for low-level groups of Bantu languages, but the result is not a complete portrayal of the family. "<a href="Glottolog">Glottolog</a>" has incorporated many of these into their classification.

The languages that share <a href="Dahl%27s%20law">Dahl's law</a> may also form a valid group, <a href="Northeast%20Bantu%20languages">Northeast Bantu</a>. The infobox at right lists these together with various low-level groups that are fairly uncontroversial, though they continue to be revised. The development of a rigorous genealogical classification of many branches of Niger–Congo, not just Bantu, is hampered by insufficient data.

Guthrie reconstructed both the phonemic inventory and the vocabulary of Proto-Bantu.

The most prominent <a href="Grammar">grammatical</a> characteristic of Bantu languages is the extensive use of <a href="affix">affix</a>es (see <a href="Sotho%20grammar">Sotho grammar</a> and <a href="Luganda%23Noun%20classes">Ganda noun classes</a> for detailed discussions of these affixes). Each noun belongs to a <a href="noun%20class">class</a>, and each language may have several numbered classes, somewhat like <a href="grammatical%20gender">grammatical gender</a> in European languages. The class is indicated by a prefix that is part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun. Plural is indicated by a change of class, with a resulting change of prefix.

The verb has a number of prefixes, though in the western languages these are often treated as independent words. In <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>, for example, "Mtoto mdogo amekisoma" (for comparison, "Kamwana kadoko karikuverenga" in <a href="Shona%20language">Shona language</a>) means 'The small child has read it [a book]'. "Mtoto" 'child' governs the adjective prefix "m-" and the verb subject prefix "a-". Then comes perfect tense "-me-" and an object marker "-ki-" agreeing with implicit "kitabu" 'book' (from Arabic "kitab"). Pluralizing to 'children' gives "Watoto wadogo wamekisoma" ("Vana vadoko vakaverenga" in Shona), and <a href="plural">plural</a>izing to 'books' ("vitabu") gives "Watoto wadogo wamevisoma".

Bantu words are typically made up of <a href="Syllable%23Coda">open syllable</a>s of the type CV (consonant-vowel) with most languages having syllables exclusively of this type. The <a href="Bushong%20language">Bushong language</a> recorded by Vansina, however, has final consonants, while slurring of the final syllable (though written) is reported as common among the <a href="Tonga%20%28Nyasa%29%20language">Tonga</a> of Malawi. The morphological shape of Bantu words is typically CV, VCV, CVCV, VCVCV, etc.; that is, any combination of CV (with possibly a V- syllable at the start). In other words, a strong claim for this language family is that almost all words end in a vowel, precisely because closed syllables (CVC) are not permissible in most of the documented languages, as far as is understood. 

This tendency to avoid <a href="consonant%20cluster">consonant cluster</a>s in some positions is important when words are imported from <a href="English%20language">English</a> or other non-Bantu languages. An example from <a href="Chewa%20language">Chewa</a>: the word "school", borrowed from English, and then transformed to fit the sound patterns of this language, is "sukulu". That is, "sk-" has been broken up by inserting an <a href="epenthesis">epenthetic</a> "-u-"; "-u" has also been added at the end of the word. Another example is "buledi" for "bread". Similar effects are seen in <a href="loanword">loanword</a>s for other non-African CV languages like <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>. However, a clustering of sounds at the beginning of a syllable can be readily observed in such languages as Shona, and the <a href="Makua%20languages">Makua languages</a>.

<a href="Reduplication">Reduplication</a> is a common morphological phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to indicate frequency or intensity of the action signalled by the (unreduplicated) verb stem.


Well-known words and names that have reduplication include
Repetition emphasizes the repeated word in the context that it is used. For instance, "Mwenda pole hajikwai," while, "Pole pole ndio mwendo," has two to emphasize the consistency of slowness of the pace. The meaning of the former in translation is, "He who goes slowly doesn't trip," and that of the latter is, "A slow but steady pace wins the race." Haraka haraka would mean hurrying just for the sake of hurrying, reckless hurry, as in "Njoo! Haraka haraka" [come here! Hurry, hurry].

In contrast, there are some words in some of the languages in which reduplication has the opposite meaning. It usually denotes short durations, and or lower intensity of the action and also means a few repetitions or a little bit more.


The following is a list of nominal classes in Bantu:
Following is an incomplete list of the principal Bantu languages of each country. Included are those languages that constitute at least 1% of the population and have at least 10% the number of speakers of the largest Bantu language in the country.
An attempt at a full list of Bantu languages (with various conflations and a puzzlingly diverse nomenclature) can be found in "The Bantu Languages of Africa", 1959.

Most languages are best known in English without the class prefix ("Swahili", "Tswana", "Ndebele"), but are sometimes seen with the (language-specific) prefix ("Kiswahili", "Setswana", "Sindebele"). In a few cases prefixes are used to distinguish languages with the same root in their name, such as <a href="Luba-Kasai%20language">Tshiluba</a> and <a href="Luba-Katanga%20language">Kiluba</a> (both "Luba"), <a href="Umbundu">Umbundu</a> and <a href="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a> (both "Mbundu"). The bare (prefixless) form typically does not occur in the language itself, but is the basis for other words based on the ethnicity. So, in the country of <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> the people are the "<a href="Tswana%20people">Batswana</a>", one person is a "Motswana", and the language is "<a href="Setswana">Setswana</a>"; and in <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, centred on the kingdom of "<a href="Buganda">Buganda</a>", the dominant ethnicity are the "<a href="Baganda">Baganda</a>" (sg. "Muganda"), whose language is "<a href="Luganda">Luganda</a>".

CIM-10 Bomarc

The Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc (IM-99 Weapon System prior to September 1962) was a supersonic long-range <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a> (SAM) used during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> for the air defense of North America. In addition to being the first operational long-range SAM, it was the only SAM deployed by the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>.

Stored horizontally in a launcher shelter with movable roof, the missile was erected, fired vertically using <a href="Booster%20%28rocketry%29">rocket boosters</a> to high altitude, and then tipped over into a horizontal Mach 2.5 cruise powered by <a href="ramjet">ramjet</a> engines. This lofted trajectory allowed the missile to operate at a maximum range as great as . Controlled from the ground for most of its flight, when it reached the target area it was commanded to begin a dive, activating an onboard <a href="active%20radar%20homing">active radar homing</a> seeker for <a href="terminal%20guidance">terminal guidance</a>. A radar <a href="proximity%20fuse">proximity fuse</a> detonated the warhead, either a large conventional explosive or the <a href="W40%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">W40 nuclear warhead</a>.

The Air Force originally planned for a total of 52 sites covering most of the major cities and industrial regions in the US. The <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a> was deploying their own systems at the same time, and the two services fought constantly both in political circles and in the press. Development dragged on, and by the time it was ready for deployment in the late 1950s, the nuclear threat had moved from manned bombers to the <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a> (ICBM), while the Army had successfully deployed their own system that filled any possible role in the 1960s, in spite of Air Force claims to the contrary.

As testing continued, the Air Force reduced its plans to sixteen sites, and then again to eight with an additional two sites in Canada. The first US site was declared operational in 1959, but with only a single working missile. Bringing the rest of the missiles into service took years, by which time the system was totally obsolete. Deactivations began in 1969 and by 1972 all Bomarc sites had been shut down. A small number were used as target drones, and only a few remain on display today.

In 1946, Boeing started to study surface-to-air guided missiles under the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> project MX-606. By 1950, Boeing had launched more than 100 test rockets in various configurations, all under the designator XSAM-A-1 GAPA (Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft). Because these tests were very promising, Boeing received a USAF contract in 1949 to develop a pilotless interceptor (a term then used by the USAF for air-defense guided missiles) under project MX-1599. The MX-1599 missile was to be a ramjet-powered, nuclear-armed long-range surface-to-air missile to defend the Continental United States from high-flying bombers. The <a href="Michigan%20Aeronautical%20Research%20Center">Michigan Aerospace Research Center</a> (MARC) was added to the project soon afterward, and this gave the new missile its name Bomarc (for Boeing and MARC). In 1951, the USAF decided to emphasize its point of view that missiles were nothing else than pilotless aircraft by assigning aircraft designators to its missile projects, and anti-aircraft missiles received F-for-Fighter designations. The Bomarc became the F-99.

Test flights of XF-99 test vehicles began in September 1952 and continued through early 1955. The XF-99 tested only the liquid-fueled booster rocket, which would accelerate the missile to ramjet ignition speed. In February 1955, tests of the XF-99A propulsion test vehicles began. These included live ramjets, but still had no guidance system or warhead. The designation YF-99A had been reserved for the operational test vehicles. In August 1955, the USAF discontinued the use of aircraft-like type designators for missiles, and the XF-99A and YF-99A became XIM-99A and YIM-99A, respectively. Originally the USAF had allocated the designation IM-69, but this was changed (possibly at Boeing's request to keep number 99) to IM-99 in October 1955. In October 1957, the first YIM-99A production-representative prototype flew with full guidance, and succeeded to pass the target within destructive range. In late 1957, Boeing received the production contract for the IM-99A Bomarc A interceptor missile, and in September 1959, the first IM-99A squadron became operational.

The IM-99A had an operational radius of and was designed to fly at <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 2.5–2.8 at a cruising altitude of . It was long and weighed . Its armament was either a conventional warhead or a <a href="W40%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">W40 nuclear warhead</a> (7–10 <a href="TNT%20equivalent">kiloton</a> yield). A <a href="Liquid-propellant%20rocket">liquid-fuel rocket</a> engine boosted the Bomarc to Mach 2, when its <a href="Marquardt%20RJ43">Marquardt RJ43-MA-3</a> <a href="ramjet">ramjet</a> engines, fueled by 80-octane gasoline, would take over for the remainder of the flight. This was the same model of engine used to power both the <a href="Lockheed%20X-7">Lockheed X-7</a>, the <a href="Lockheed%20AQM-60%20Kingfisher">Lockheed AQM-60 Kingfisher</a> drone used to test air defenses, and the <a href="Lockheed%20D-21">Lockheed D-21</a> launched from the back of an SR-71 .

The operational IM-99A missiles were based horizontally in semi-hardened shelters, nicknamed "coffins". After the launch order, the shelter's roof would slide open, and the missile raised to the vertical. After the missile was supplied with fuel for the booster rocket, it would be launched by the Aerojet General LR59-AJ-13 booster. After sufficient speed was reached, the Marquardt RJ43-MA-3 ramjets would ignite and propel the missile to its cruise speed of Mach 2.8 at an altitude of .

When the Bomarc was within of the target, its own Westinghouse AN/DPN-34 radar guided the missile to the interception point. The maximum range of the IM-99A was , and it was fitted with either a conventional high-explosive or a 10 kiloton W-40 nuclear fission warhead.

The Bomarc relied on the <a href="Semi-Automatic%20Ground%20Environment">Semi-Automatic Ground Environment</a> (SAGE), an automated control system used by <a href="North%20American%20Aerospace%20Defense%20Command">NORAD</a> for detecting, tracking and intercepting enemy <a href="Bomber">bomber aircraft</a>. SAGE allowed for remote launching of the Bomarc missiles, which were housed in a constant combat-ready basis in individual launch shelters in remote areas. At the height of the program, there were 14 Bomarc sites located in the US and two in Canada.

The liquid-fuel booster of the Bomarc A was no optimal solution. It took two minutes to fuel before launch, which could be a long time in high-speed intercepts, and its <a href="hypergolic%20propellant">hypergolic propellant</a>s (hydrazine and nitric acid) were very dangerous to handle, leading to several serious accidents.

As soon as high-thrust <a href="solid-fuel%20rocket">solid-fuel rocket</a>s became a reality in the mid-1950s, the USAF began to develop a new solid-fueled Bomarc variant, the IM-99B Bomarc B. It used a <a href="Thiokol">Thiokol</a> XM51 booster, and also had improved Marquardt RJ43-MA-7 (and finally the RJ43-MA-11) ramjets. The first IM-99B was launched in May 1959, but problems with the new propulsion system delayed the first fully successful flight until July 1960, when a supersonic KD2U-1/MQM-15A Regulus II drone was intercepted. Because the new booster took up less space in the missile, more ramjet fuel could be carried, increasing the range to . The terminal homing system was also improved, using the world's first <a href="Pulse-Doppler%20radar">pulse Doppler search radar</a>, the Westinghouse AN/DPN-53. All Bomarc Bs were equipped with the W-40 nuclear warhead. In June 1961, the first IM-99B squadron became operational, and Bomarc B quickly replaced most Bomarc A missiles. On 23 March 1961, a Bomarc B successfully intercepted a Regulus II cruise missile flying at 100,000 ft, thus achieving the highest interception in the world up to that date.

Boeing built 570 Bomarc missiles between 1957 and 1964, 269 CIM-10A, 301 CIM-10B.

In September 1958 Air Research & Development Command decided to transfer the Bomarc program from its testing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to a new facility on <a href="Santa%20Rosa%20Island%20%28Florida%29">Santa Rosa Island</a>, immediately south of Eglin AFB <a href="Hurlburt%20Field">Hurlburt Field</a> on the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. To operate the facility and to provide training and operational evaluation in the missile program, <a href="Aerospace%20Defense%20Command">Air Defense Command</a> established the 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) (4751st ADW) on 15 January 1958. The first launch from Santa Rosa took place on 15 January 1959.

The first USAF operational Bomarc squadron was the <a href="46th%20Tactical%20Missile%20Squadron">46th Air Defense Missile Squadron</a> (ADMS), organized on 1 January 1959 and activated on 25 March. The 46th ADMS was assigned to the <a href="Eastern%20Air%20Defense%20Sector">New York Air Defense Sector</a> at <a href="McGuire%20Air%20Force%20Base">McGuire Air Force Base</a>, New Jersey. The training program, under the 4751st ADW used technicians acting as instructors and was established for a four-month duration. Training included missile maintenance; SAGE operations and launch procedures, including the launch of an unarmed missile at Eglin. In September 1959 the squadron assembled at their permanent station, the Bomarc site near McGuire AFB, and trained for operational readiness. The first Bomarc-A were used at McGuire on 19 September 1959 with Kincheloe AFB getting the first operational IM-99Bs. While several of the squadrons replicated earlier fighter interceptor unit numbers, they were all new organizations with no previous historical counterpart.

ADC's initial plans called for some 52 Bomarc sites around the United States with 120 missiles each but as defense budgets decreased during the 1950s the number of sites dropped substantially. Ongoing development and reliability problems didn't help, nor did Congressional debate over the missile's usefulness and necessity. In June 1959, the Air Force authorized 16 Bomarc sites with 56 missiles each; the initial five would get the IM-99A with the remainder getting the IM-99B. However, in March 1960, HQ USAF cut deployment to eight sites in the United States and two in Canada.

Within a year of operations, a Bomarc-A with a nuclear warhead caught fire at McGuire AFB on 7 June 1960 after its on-board helium tank exploded. While the missile's explosives did not detonate, the heat melted the warhead and released plutonium, which the fire crews spread. The Air Force and the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> cleaned up the site and covered it with concrete. This was the only major incident involving the weapon system. The site remained in operation for several years following the fire. Since its closure in 1972, the area has remained off limits, primarily due to low levels of plutonium contamination. In 2002, the concrete at the site was removed and transported to Lakehurst Naval Air Station for transport by rail to a site for proper disposal.

In 1962, the US Air Force started using modified A-models as drones; following the October 1962 tri-service redesignation of aircraft and weapons systems they became CQM-10As. Otherwise the air defense missile squadrons maintained alert while making regular trips to Santa Rosa Island for training and firing practice. After the inactivation of the 4751st ADW(M) on 1 July 1962 and transfer of Hurlburt to <a href="Tactical%20Air%20Command">Tactical Air Command</a> for air commando operations the 4751st Air Defense Squadron (Missile) remained at Hurlburt and Santa Rosa Island for training purposes.

In 1964, the liquid-fueled Bomarc-A sites and squadrons began to be deactivated. The sites at Dow and Suffolk County closed first. The remainder continued to be operational for several more years while the government started dismantling the air defense missile network. Niagara Falls was the first BOMARC B installation to close, in December 1969; the others remained on alert through 1972. In April 1972, the last Bomarc B in U.S. Air Force service was retired at McGuire and the 46th ADMS inactivated and the base was deactivated.

In the era of the intercontinental ballistic missiles the Bomarc, designed to intercept relatively slow manned bombers, had become a useless asset. The remaining Bomarc missiles were used by all armed services as high-speed target drones for tests of other air-defense missiles. The Bomarc A and Bomarc B targets were designated as CQM-10A and CQM-10B, respectively.

Following the accident, the McGuire complex has never been sold or converted to other uses and remains in Air Force ownership, making it the most intact site of the eight in the US. It has been nominated to the National Register of Historic Sites. Although a number of IM-99/CIM-10 Bomarcs have been placed on public display, because of concerns about the possible environmental hazards of the <a href="Mag-Thor">thoriated magnesium</a> structure of the airframe several have been removed from public view.

Russ Sneddon, director of the <a href="Air%20Force%20Armament%20Museum">Air Force Armament Museum</a>, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida provided information about missing CIM-10 exhibit airframe serial 59-2016, one of the museum's original artifacts from its founding in 1975 and donated by the 4751st Air Defense Squadron at <a href="Hurlburt%20Field">Hurlburt Field</a>, Eglin Auxiliary Field 9, Eglin AFB. As of December 2006, the suspect missile was stored in a secure compound behind the Armaments Museum. In December 2010, the airframe was still on premises, but partly dismantled.

The Bomarc Missile Program was highly controversial in Canada. The <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada">Progressive Conservative</a> government of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="John%20Diefenbaker">John Diefenbaker</a> initially agreed to deploy the missiles, and shortly thereafter controversially scrapped the <a href="Avro%20Canada%20CF-105%20Arrow">Avro Arrow</a>, a supersonic manned interceptor aircraft, arguing that the missile program made the Arrow unnecessary.

Initially, it was unclear whether the missiles would be equipped with nuclear warheads. By 1960 it became known that the missiles were to have a nuclear payload, and a debate ensued about whether Canada should accept nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the Diefenbaker government decided that the Bomarcs should not be equipped with nuclear warheads. The dispute split the Diefenbaker <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Canada">Cabinet</a>, and led to the collapse of the government in 1963. The Official Opposition and <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal Party</a> leader <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson">Lester B. Pearson</a> originally was against nuclear missiles, but reversed his personal position and argued in favor of accepting nuclear warheads. He won the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201963">1963 election</a>, largely on the basis of this issue, and his new Liberal government proceeded to accept nuclear-armed Bomarcs, with the first being deployed on 31 December 1963. When the nuclear warheads were deployed, Pearson's wife, Maryon, resigned her honorary membership in the anti-nuclear weapons group, Voice of Women.

Canadian operational deployment of the Bomarc involved the formation of two specialized Surface/Air Missile squadrons. The first to begin operations was No. 446 SAM Squadron at RCAF Station <a href="North%20Bay%2C%20Ontario">North Bay, Ontario</a> which was the command and control center for both squadrons. With construction of the compound and related facilities completed in 1961, the squadron received its Bomarcs in 1961, without nuclear warheads. The squadron became fully operational from 31 December 1963, when the nuclear warheads arrived, until disbanding on 31 March 1972. All the warheads were stored separately and under control of Detachment 1 of the USAF 425th Munitions Maintenance Squadron. During operational service, the Bomarcs were maintained on stand-by, on a 24-hour basis, but were never fired, although the squadron test-fired the missiles at Eglin AFB, Florida on annual winter retreats.

No. 447 SAM Squadron operating out of RCAF Station <a href="La%20Macaza%2C%20Quebec">La Macaza, Quebec</a> was activated on 15 September 1962 although warheads were not delivered until late 1963. The squadron followed the same operational procedures as No. 446, its sister squadron. With the passage of time the operational capability of the 1950s-era Bomarc system no longer met modern requirements; the Department of National Defence deemed that the Bomarc missile defense was no longer a viable system, and ordered both squadrons to be stood down in 1972. The bunkers and ancillary facilities remain at both former sites.




Locations under construction but not activated. Each site was programmed for 28 IM-99B missiles:

The Branco River (; Engl: "White River") is the principal <a href="Tributary">affluent</a> of the <a href="Rio%20Negro%20%28Amazon%29">Rio Negro</a> from the north. 

The river drains the <a href="Guayanan%20Highlands%20moist%20forests">Guayanan Highlands moist forests</a> ecoregion.
It is enriched by many streams from the <a href="Tepui">Tepui</a> highlands which separate <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a> from <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>.

Bus

A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a <a href="road%20vehicle">road vehicle</a> designed to carry many <a href="passenger">passenger</a>s. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the <a href="single-decker%20bus">single-decker</a> <a href="rigid%20bus">rigid bus</a>, with larger loads carried by <a href="double-decker%20bus">double-decker</a> and <a href="articulated%20bus">articulated bus</a>es, and smaller loads carried by <a href="midibus">midibus</a>es and <a href="minibus">minibus</a>es; <a href="coach%20%28vehicle%29">coaches</a> are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, <a href="bus%20driver">bus driver</a>s require a special licence above and beyond a regular <a href="driver%27s%20licence">driver's licence</a>.

Buses may be used for <a href="Public%20transport%20bus%20service">scheduled bus transport</a>, <a href="Coach%20%28scheduled%20transport%29">scheduled coach transport</a>, <a href="school%20transport">school transport</a>, private hire, or <a href="Tour%20bus">tourism</a>; promotional buses may be used for <a href="political%20campaign">political campaign</a>s and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles.

<a href="Horsebus">Horse-drawn buses</a> were used from the 1820s, followed by <a href="steam%20bus">steam bus</a>es in the 1830s, and electric <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es in 1882. The first <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion engine</a> buses, or <a href="motor%20bus">motor bus</a>es, were used in 1895. Recently, interest has been growing in <a href="hybrid%20electric%20bus">hybrid electric bus</a>es, <a href="fuel%20cell%20bus">fuel cell bus</a>es, and <a href="electric%20bus">electric bus</a>es, as well as ones powered by <a href="compressed%20natural%20gas">compressed natural gas</a> or <a href="biodiesel">biodiesel</a>. As of the 2010s, <a href="bus%20manufacturing">bus manufacturing</a> is increasingly <a href="globalisation">globalised</a>, with the same designs appearing around the world.

Bus is a <a href="clipping%20%28morphology%29">clipped</a> form of the Latin word "omnibus". The first horse-drawn omnibus service was started by a businessman named Stanislas Baudry in the French city of <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a> in 1823. The first vehicles stopped in front of the shop of a hatter named Omnés, which had a large sign reading "Omnes Omnibus", a pun on the Latin-sounding name of that hatter; "omnes" means "all" and "omnibus" means (among other things) "for all" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. Nantes citizens soon gave the nickname omnibus to the vehicle. The omnibus in Nantes was a success and Baudry moved to Paris and launched the first omnibus service there in April 1828. A similar service was introduced in London in 1829.

Regular intercity bus services by steam-powered buses were pioneered in England in the 1830s by <a href="Walter%20Hancock">Walter Hancock</a> and by associates of <a href="Goldsworthy%20Gurney">Sir Goldsworthy Gurney</a>, among others, running reliable services over road conditions which were too hazardous for horse-drawn transportation.

The first mechanically propelled omnibus appeared on the streets of London on 22 April 1833. Steam carriages were much less likely to overturn, they travelled faster than horse-drawn carriages, they were much cheaper to run, and caused much less damage to the road surface due to their wide tyres.

However, the heavy road <a href="Toll%20road">tolls</a> imposed by the <a href="turnpike%20trusts">turnpike trusts</a> discouraged steam road vehicles and left the way clear for the horse bus companies, and from 1861 onwards, harsh legislation virtually eliminated mechanically propelled vehicles from the roads of Great Britain for 30 years, the <a href="Locomotive%20Act">Locomotive Act</a> of that year imposing restrictive speed limits on "road locomotives" of 5 mph in towns and cities, and 10 mph in the country.

In parallel to the development of the bus was the invention of the electric trolleybus, typically fed through <a href="trolley%20pole">trolley pole</a>s by <a href="Overhead%20lines">overhead wires</a>. The Siemens brothers, <a href="William%20Siemens">William</a> in England and <a href="Ernst%20Werner%20von%20Siemens">Ernst Werner</a> in Germany, collaborated on the development of the trolleybus concept. Sir William first proposed the idea in an article to the "<a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Journal of the Society of Arts</a>" in 1881 as an "...arrangement by which an ordinary omnibus...would have a suspender thrown at intervals from one side of the street to the other, and two wires hanging from these suspenders; allowing contact rollers to run on these two wires, the current could be conveyed to the tram-car, and back again to the dynamo machine at the station, without the necessity of running upon rails at all."

The first such vehicle, the <a href="Electromote">Electromote</a>, was made by his brother Dr. Ernst Werner von Siemens and presented to the public in 1882 in <a href="Halensee">Halensee</a>, <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>. Although this experimental vehicle fulfilled all the technical criteria of a typical trolleybus, it was dismantled in the same year after the demonstration.

Max Schiemann opened a passenger-carrying trolleybus in 1901 near <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, in Germany. Although this system operated only until 1904, Schiemann had developed what is now the standard trolleybus current collection system. In the early days, a few other methods of current collection were used. <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> and <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a> became the first cities to put trolleybuses into service in Great Britain on 20 June 1911.

In <a href="Siegerland">Siegerland</a>, Germany, two passenger bus lines ran briefly, but unprofitably, in 1895 using a six-passenger motor carriage developed from the 1893 <a href="Benz%20Viktoria">Benz Viktoria</a>. Another commercial bus line using the same model Benz omnibuses ran for a short time in 1898 in the rural area around <a href="Llandudno">Llandudno</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>.

<a href="Daimler%20Motoren%20Gesellschaft">Daimler</a> also produced one of the earliest motor-bus models in 1898, selling a double-decker bus to the Motor Traction Company which was first used on the streets of London on 23 April 1898. The vehicle had a maximum speed of 18 kph and accommodated up to 20 passengers, in an enclosed area below and on an open-air platform above. With the success and popularity of this bus, Daimler expanded production, selling more buses to companies in London and, in 1899, to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> and <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a>.Daimler also entered into a partnership with the British company Milnes and developed a new double-decker in 1902 that became the market standard.
The first mass-produced bus model was the <a href="LGOC%20B-type">B-type</a> <a href="double-decker%20bus">double-decker bus</a>, designed by <a href="Frank%20Searle%20%281874-1948%29">Frank Searle</a> and operated by the <a href="London%20General%20Omnibus%20Company">London General Omnibus Company</a> – it entered service in 1910, and almost 3,000 had been built by the end of the decade. Hundreds saw military service on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

The <a href="Yellow%20Coach%20Manufacturing%20Company">Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company</a>, which rapidly became a major manufacturer of buses in the US, was founded in Chicago in 1923 by <a href="John%20D.%20Hertz">John D. Hertz</a>. <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> purchased a majority stake in 1925 and changed its name to the Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. They then purchased the balance of the shares in 1943 to form the <a href="GMC%20%28Truck%29">GM Truck and Coach Division</a>.

Models expanded in the 20th century, leading to the widespread introduction of the contemporary recognizable form of full-sized buses from the 1950s. The <a href="AEC%20Routemaster">AEC Routemaster</a>, developed in the 1950s, was a pioneering design and remains an icon of London to this day. The innovative design used lightweight aluminium and techniques developed in aircraft production during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. As well as a novel weight-saving integral design, it also introduced for the first time on a bus <a href="independent%20suspension">independent front suspension</a>, <a href="power%20steering">power steering</a>, a fully <a href="automatic%20gearbox">automatic gearbox</a>, and <a href="Hydraulic%20brake">power-hydraulic braking</a>.

Formats include <a href="single-decker%20bus">single-decker bus</a>, double-decker bus (both usually with a <a href="rigid%20bus">rigid chassis</a>) and <a href="articulated%20bus">articulated bus</a> (or 'bendy-bus') the prevalence of which varies from country to country. <a href="Bi-articulated%20bus">Bi-articulated bus</a>es are also manufactured, and passenger-carrying trailers—either towed behind a <a href="rigid%20bus">rigid bus</a> (a <a href="Trailer%20%28vehicle%29">bus trailer</a>) or hauled as a trailer by a <a href="truck">truck</a> (a <a href="trailer%20bus">trailer bus</a>). Smaller <a href="midibus">midibus</a>es have a lower capacity and <a href="open-top%20bus">open-top bus</a>es are typically used for leisure purposes. In many new fleets, particularly in local transit systems, a shift to <a href="low-floor%20bus">low-floor bus</a>es is occurring, primarily for easier accessibility. Coaches are designed for longer-distance travel and are typically fitted with individual high-backed reclining seats, seat belts, toilets, and <a href="audio-visual">audio-visual</a> entertainment systems, and can operate at higher speeds with more capacity for luggage. Coaches may be single- or double-deckers, articulated, and often include a separate luggage compartment under the passenger floor. <a href="Guided%20bus">Guided bus</a>es are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at <a href="bus%20stop">bus stop</a>s and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or <a href="bus%20lane">bus lane</a>s.

<a href="Bus%20manufacturing">Bus manufacturing</a> may be by a single company (an integral manufacturer), or by one manufacturer's building a bus body over a chassis produced by another manufacturer.

<a href="Transit%20bus">Transit bus</a>es used to be mainly <a href="high-floor">high-floor</a> vehicles. However, they are now increasingly of <a href="low-floor%20bus">low-floor</a> design and optionally also 'kneel' <a href="air%20suspension">air suspension</a> and have electrically or hydraulically extended under-floor ramps to provide level access for <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a> users and people with <a href="baby%20transport">baby carriages</a>. Prior to more general use of such technology, these wheelchair users could only use specialist <a href="paratransit">paratransit</a> mobility buses.

Accessible vehicles also have wider entrances and interior gangways and space for wheelchairs. Interior fittings and <a href="rollsign">destination displays</a> may also be designed to be usable by the <a href="visually%20impaired">visually impaired</a>. Coaches generally use <a href="wheelchair%20lift">wheelchair lift</a>s instead of low-floor designs. In some countries, vehicles are required to have these features by <a href="Disability%20discrimination%20act">disability discrimination laws</a>.

Buses were initially configured with an engine in the front and an entrance at the rear. With the transition to one-man operation, many manufacturers moved to mid- or rear-engined designs, with a single door at the front or multiple doors. The move to the low-floor design has all but eliminated the mid-engined design, although some coaches still have mid-mounted engines. Front-engined buses still persist for niche markets such as American school buses, some minibuses, and buses in less developed countries, which may be derived from truck chassis, rather than purpose-built bus designs. Most buses have two <a href="axles">axles</a>, articulated buses have three.

<a href="Guided%20bus">Guided bus</a>es are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or <a href="bus%20lane">bus lane</a>s. Guidance can be mechanical, optical, or electromagnetic. Extensions of the guided technology include the <a href="Bombardier%20Guided%20Light%20Transit">Guided Light Transit</a> and <a href="Translohr">Translohr</a> systems, although these are more often termed 'rubber-tyred trams' as they have limited or no mobility away from their guideways.

<a href="Transit%20bus">Transit bus</a>es are normally painted to identify the operator or a route, function, or to demarcate low-cost or premium service buses. Liveries may be painted onto the vehicle, applied using adhesive <a href="vinyl%20%28fabric%29">vinyl</a> technologies, or using <a href="decal">decal</a>s. Vehicles often also carry <a href="bus%20advertising">bus advertising</a> or part or all of their visible surfaces (as <a href="mobile%20billboard">mobile billboard</a>). <a href="Campaign%20bus">Campaign bus</a>es may be decorated with key campaign messages; these can be to promote an event or initiative.

The most common power source since the 1920s has been the <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>. Early buses, known as trolleybuses, were powered by electricity supplied from <a href="overhead%20lines">overhead lines</a>. Nowadays, electric buses often carry their own battery, which is sometimes <a href="Phileas%20%28public%20transport%29">recharged on stops/stations</a> to keep the size of the battery small/lightweight. Currently, interest exists in <a href="hybrid%20electric%20bus">hybrid electric bus</a>es, <a href="fuel%20cell%20bus">fuel cell bus</a>es, <a href="electric%20bus">electric bus</a>es, and ones powered by <a href="compressed%20natural%20gas">compressed natural gas</a> or <a href="biodiesel">biodiesel</a>. <a href="Gyrobus">Gyrobus</a>es, which are powered by the momentum stored by a <a href="flywheel">flywheel</a>, were tried in the 1940s.

<a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>:

Early bus manufacturing grew out of carriage <a href="coachbuilding">coachbuilding</a>, and later out of automobile or truck manufacturers. Early buses were merely a bus body fitted to a truck chassis. This body+chassis approach has continued with modern specialist manufacturers, although there also exist integral designs such as the <a href="Leyland%20National">Leyland National</a> where the two are practically inseparable. Specialist builders also exist and concentrate on building buses for special uses or modifying standard buses into specialised products.

Integral designs have the advantages that they are have been well-tested for strength and stability, and also are <a href="Commercial%20off-the-shelf">off-the-shelf</a>. However, two incentives cause use of the chassis+body model. First, it allows the buyer and manufacturer both to shop for the best deal for their needs, rather than having to settle on one fixed design—the buyer can choose the body and the chassis separately. Second, over the lifetime of a vehicle (in constant service and heavy traffic), it will likely get minor damage now and again, and being able easily to replace a body panel or window etc. can vastly increase its <a href="service%20life">service life</a> and save the cost and inconvenience of removing it from service.

As with the rest of the <a href="automotive%20industry">automotive industry</a>, into the 20th century, bus manufacturing increasingly became globalized, with manufacturers producing buses far from their intended market to exploit labour and material cost advantages. As with the cars, new models are often exhibited by manufacturers at prestigious industry shows to gain new orders. A typical city bus costs almost US$450,000.

<a href="Transit%20bus">Transit bus</a>es, used on <a href="public%20transport%20bus%20service">public transport bus service</a>s, have utilitarian fittings designed for efficient movement of large numbers of people, and often have multiple doors. Coaches are used for longer-distance routes. High-capacity <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a> services may use the bi-articulated bus or tram-style buses such as the <a href="Wright%20StreetCar">Wright StreetCar</a> and the <a href="Iveco%20Bus">Irisbus</a> Civis.

Buses and coach services often operate to a predetermined published <a href="public%20transport%20timetable">public transport timetable</a> defining the route and the timing, but smaller vehicles may be used on more flexible <a href="demand%20responsive%20transport">demand responsive transport</a> services.

Buses play a major part in the tourism industry. <a href="Tour%20bus">Tour bus</a>es around the world allow tourists to view local attractions or scenery. These are often <a href="open-top%20bus">open-top bus</a>es, but can also be by regular bus or coach.

In local <a href="sightseeing">sightseeing</a>, <a href="City%20Sightseeing">City Sightseeing</a> is the largest operator of local tour buses, operating on a franchised basis all over the world. Specialist tour buses are also often owned and operated by <a href="safari%20park">safari park</a>s and other <a href="Amusement%20park">theme parks or resorts</a>. Longer-distance tours are also carried out by bus, either on a turn up and go basis or through a <a href="tour%20operator">tour operator</a>, and usually allow disembarkation from the bus to allow touring of sites of interest on foot. These may be day trips or longer <a href="excursion">excursion</a>s incorporating hotel stays. Tour buses often carry a <a href="tour%20guide">tour guide</a>, although the driver or a recorded <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> may also perform this function. The tour operator may itself be a subsidiary of a company that operates buses and coaches for other uses or an independent company that charters buses or coaches. <a href="Commuter">Commuter</a> transport operators may also use their coaches to conduct tours within the target city between the morning and evening commuter transport journey.

Buses and coaches are also a common component of the wider <a href="package%20holiday">package holiday</a> industry, providing private airport transfers (in addition to general <a href="airport%20bus">airport bus</a>es) and organised tours and day trips for holidaymakers on the package.

Tour buses can also be hired as chartered buses by groups as part of sightseeing at popular holiday destinations. These private tour buses may offer specific stops like all the historical sights or specifically casinos or allow the customers the comfort to make their own itineraries as per the places and activities they want to cover while on their tour. Tour buses come with professional and informed staff, insurance and maintain state governed safety standards. Not only this to make the experience for the tourists more comfortable provide facilities like entertainment units, luxurious reclining seats, large scenic windows, and even lavatories if needed.

Public long-distance coach networks are also often used as a low-cost method of travel by students or young people travelling the world. Some companies such as <a href="Topdeck%20Travel">Topdeck Travel</a> were set up to specifically use buses to drive the <a href="hippie%20trail">hippie trail</a> or travel to places such as North Africa.

In many tourist or travel destinations, a bus is part of the <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>, such as the North American <a href="tourist%20trolley">tourist trolley</a>s, London's <a href="AEC%20Routemaster">AEC Routemaster</a> <a href="London%20Buses%20heritage%20routes%20%28disambiguation%29">heritage route</a>s, or the <a href="customised%20buses">customised buses</a> of Malta, Asia, and the Americas.

In some countries, particularly the USA and Canada, buses used to transport school children have evolved into a specific design with specified mandatory features. American states have also adopted laws regarding motorist conduct around school buses, including serious fines and the possibility of prison time for passing a stopped school bus in the process of offloading children passengers. These <a href="school%20bus">school bus</a>es feature things such as the <a href="school%20bus%20yellow">school bus yellow</a> livery and <a href="School%20bus%20crossing%20arm">crossing guards</a>. Other countries may mandate the use of <a href="seat%20belts">seat belts</a>. As a minimum, many countries require a bus carrying students to display a , and may also adopt yellow liveries. Student transport often uses older buses cascaded from service use, retrofitted with more seats or seatbelts. Student transport may be operated by local authorities or private contractors. Schools may also own and operate their own buses for other transport needs, such as class <a href="field%20trip">field trip</a>s, or transport to associated sports, music, or other school events.

Due to the costs involved in owning, operating, and driving buses and coaches, many bus and coach use a <a href="private%20hire">private hire</a> of vehicles from <a href="charter">charter</a> bus companies, either for a day or two or a longer contract basis, where the charter company provides the vehicles and qualified drivers.
Charter bus operators may be completely independent businesses, or charter hire may be a subsidiary business of a public transport operator that might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual-purpose coach-seated buses. Many private <a href="taxicab">taxicab</a> companies also operate larger <a href="minibus">minibus</a> vehicles to cater for group fares. Companies, private groups, and social clubs may hire buses or coaches as a cost-effective method of transporting a group to an event or site, such as a group meeting, <a href="racing">racing</a> event, or organised recreational activity such as a <a href="summer%20camp">summer camp</a>. <a href="Schools">Schools</a> often hire charter bus services on regular basis for transportation of children to and from their homes. Chartered buses are also used by education institutes for transport to <a href="convention%20%28meeting%29">convention</a>s, <a href="exhibitions">exhibitions</a>, and <a href="field%20trips">field trips</a>. Entertainment or event companies may also hire temporary shuttles buses for transport at events such as festivals or <a href="academic%20conference">conference</a>s. <a href="Party%20bus">Party bus</a>es are used by companies in a similar manner to <a href="limousine">limousine</a> hire, for luxury private transport to social events or as a touring experience. <a href="Sleeper%20bus">Sleeper bus</a>es are used by <a href="band%20%28music%29">bands</a> or other organisations that tour between entertainment venues and require mobile rest and recreation facilities. Some couples hire preserved buses for their <a href="wedding%20transport">wedding transport</a>, instead of the traditional car. Buses are often hired for <a href="parade">parade</a>s or <a href="procession">procession</a>s. <a href="Victory%20parade">Victory parade</a>s are often held for triumphant sports teams, who often tour their home town or city in an <a href="open-top%20bus">open-top bus</a>. Sports teams may also contract out their transport to a <a href="team%20bus">team bus</a>, for travel to <a href="Road%20%28sports%29">away games</a>, to a <a href="Sports%20competition">competition</a> or to a <a href="Final%20%28competition%29">final event</a>. These buses are often specially decorated in a livery matching the team colours. Private companies often contract out private shuttle bus services, for transport of their customers or patrons, such as hotels, <a href="amusement%20park">amusement park</a>s, <a href="university%20campus">university campus</a>es, or <a href="airport%20bus">private airport transfer</a> services. This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from <a href="parking%20lot">parking lot</a>s. High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for <a href="Executive%20officer">executive</a> or <a href="Very%20Important%20Person">VIP</a> transport. Charter buses may also be used in tourism and for promotion (See Tourism and Promotion sections).

Many organisations, including the police, <a href="not%20for%20profit">not for profit</a>, social or charitable groups with a regular need for group transport may find it practical or cost-effective to own and operate a bus for their own needs. These are often <a href="minibus">minibus</a>es for practical, tax and driver licensing reasons, although they can also be full-size buses. <a href="Cadet">Cadet</a> or <a href="Scouting">scout</a> groups or other youth organizations may also own buses. Specific charities may exist to fund and operate bus transport, usually using specially modified mobility buses or otherwise accessible buses (See Accessibility section). Some use their contributions to buy vehicles and provide volunteer drivers.

Airport operators make use of special airside <a href="airport%20bus">airport bus</a>es for crew and passenger transport in the secure <a href="Airside%20%28airport%29">airside</a> parts of an airport. Some public authorities, police forces, and military forces make use of <a href="armoured%20bus">armoured bus</a>es where there is a special need to provide increased passenger protection. The <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">United States Secret Service</a> acquired two in 2010 for transporting dignitaries needing special protection. <a href="Police%20department">Police department</a>s make use of <a href="police%20bus">police bus</a>es for a variety of reasons, such as <a href="Prisoner%20transport%20vehicle">prisoner transport</a>, <a href="police%20officer">officer</a> transport, temporary detention facilities, and as <a href="command%20post">command and control vehicles</a>. Some <a href="fire%20department">fire department</a>s also use a converted bus as a command post while those in cold climates might retain a bus as a heated shelter at fire scenes. Many are drawn from retired school or service buses.

Buses are often used for advertising, <a href="political%20campaign">political campaign</a>ing, , <a href="public%20relation">public relation</a>s, or <a href="Promotion%20%28marketing%29">promotional</a> purposes. These may take the form of temporary charter hire of service buses, or the temporary or permanent conversion and operation of buses, usually of <a href="Used%20good">second-hand</a> buses. Extreme examples include converting the bus with displays and decorations or <a href="awning">awning</a>s and fittings. Interiors may be fitted out for exhibition or information purposes with special equipment or <a href="audio%20visual">audio visual</a> devices.

<a href="Bus%20advertising">Bus advertising</a> takes many forms, often as interior and exterior adverts and all-over advertising liveries. The practice often extends into the exclusive private hire and use of a bus to promote a brand or product, appearing at large public events, or touring busy streets. The bus is sometimes staffed by promotions personnel, giving out free gifts. <a href="Campaign%20bus">Campaign bus</a>es are often specially decorated for a <a href="political%20campaign">political campaign</a> or other social awareness information campaign, designed to bring a specific message to different areas, or used to transport campaign personnel to local areas/meetings. Exhibition buses are often sent to public events such as <a href="fair">fair</a>s and festivals for purposes such as recruitment campaigns, for example by private companies or the <a href="armed%20force">armed force</a>s. Complex <a href="urban%20planning">urban planning</a> proposals may be organised into a mobile exhibition bus for the purposes of public consultation.

In some sparesly populated areas, it's common to use Brucks, buses with a cargo area to transport both passengers and cargo at the same time. They are especially common in the <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a>.

Historically, the types and features of buses have developed according to local needs. Buses were fitted with technology appropriate to the local climate or passenger needs, such as air conditioning in Asia, or <a href="Bicycle">cycle</a> mounts on North American buses. The bus types in use around the world where there was little mass production were often sourced second hand from other countries, such as the <a href="Malta%20bus">Malta bus</a>, and buses in use in Africa. Other countries such as Cuba required novel solutions to import restrictions, with the creation of the "camellos" (<a href="camel">camel</a> bus), a specially manufactured <a href="trailer%20bus">trailer bus</a>.

After the Second World War, manufacturers in Europe and the Far East, such as <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20buses">Mercedes-Benz buses</a> and <a href="Mitsubishi%20Fuso%20Truck%20and%20Bus%20Corporation">Mitsubishi Fuso</a> expanded into other continents influencing the use of buses previously served by local types. Use of buses around the world has also been influenced by colonial associations or political alliances between countries. Several of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth nations</a> followed the British lead and sourced buses from British manufacturers, leading to a prevalence of <a href="double-decker%20bus">double-decker bus</a>es. Several <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> countries adopted trolleybus systems, and their manufacturers such as <a href="Trolza">Trolza</a> exported trolleybuses to other friendly states. In the 1930s, Italy designed the world's only triple decker bus for the busy route between Rome and Tivoli that could carry eighty-eight passengers. It was unique not only in being a triple decker but having a separate smoking compartment on the third level.

The buses to be found in countries around the world often reflect the quality of the local road network, with high floor resilient truck-based designs prevalent in several less developed countries where buses are subject to tough operating conditions. Population density also has a major impact, where dense urbanisation such as in Japan and the far east has led to the adoption of high capacity long <a href="multi-axle%20bus">multi-axle bus</a>es, often double-deckers while South America and China are implementing large numbers of <a href="articulated%20bus">articulated bus</a>es for <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a> schemes.

Euro Bus Expo is a <a href="Trade%20fair">trade show</a>, which is held bi-ennially at the UK's <a href="National%20Exhibition%20Centre">National Exhibition Centre</a> in Birmingham. As the official show of the <a href="Confederation%20of%20Passenger%20Transport">Confederation of Passenger Transport</a>, the UK's trade association for the bus, coach and light rail industry, the three-day event offers visitors from Europe and beyond the chance to see and experience, at first hand, the very latest vehicles and product and service innovations right across the industry. The next show will be held in November 2016.

Busworld Kortrijk in <a href="Kortrijk">Kortrijk</a>, Belgium, is the leading bus trade fair in Europe. It is held bi-ennially, last time October 2013 and next time October 2015.

Most public or private buses and coaches, once they have reached the end of their service with one or more operators, are sent to the <a href="wrecking%20yard">wrecking yard</a> for breaking up for <a href="scrap">scrap</a> and <a href="spare%20part">spare part</a>s. Some buses, while not economical to keep running as service buses, are often converted in some way for use by the operator, or another user, for purposes other than revenue-earning transport. Much like old cars and trucks, buses often pass through a <a href="Car%20dealership">dealership</a> where they can be bought for a price or at auction.

Bus operators will often find it economical to convert retired buses to use as permanent <a href="training%20bus">training bus</a>es for driver training, rather than taking a regular service bus out of use. Some large operators also converted retired buses into tow bus vehicles, to act as <a href="tow%20truck">tow truck</a>s. With the outsourcing of maintenance staff and facilities, the increase in company <a href="health%20and%20safety">health and safety</a> regulations, and the increasing <a href="curb%20weight">curb weight</a>s of buses, many operators now contract their towing needs to a professional <a href="vehicle%20recovery">vehicle recovery</a> company.

Some retired buses have been converted to static or mobile cafés, often using historic buses as a <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>. Food is also provided from a catering bus, in which a bus is converted into a mobile <a href="Canteen%20%28place%29">canteen</a> and <a href="Coffee%20break">break room</a>. These are commonly seen at external <a href="filming%20location">filming location</a>s to feed the cast and crew, and at other large events to feed staff. Another use is as an emergency vehicle, such as high-capacity <a href="ambulance%20bus">ambulance bus</a> or mobile <a href="command%20center">command center</a>.

Some organisations adapt and operate <a href="playbus">playbus</a>es or learning buses to provide a <a href="playground">playground</a> or learning environments to children who might not have access to proper play areas. An ex-London <a href="AEC%20Routemaster">AEC Routemaster</a> bus has been converted to a mobile theatre and <a href="Runway%20%28fashion%29">catwalk fashion show</a>.

Some buses meet a destructive end by being entered in <a href="banger%20racing">banger races</a> or at <a href="demolition%20derby">demolition derby</a>s. A larger number of old retired buses have also been converted into mobile holiday homes and campers.

Rather than being <a href="wikt%3Ascrapped">scrapped</a> or converted for other uses, sometimes retired buses are saved for preservation. This can be done by individuals, volunteer preservation groups or charitable trusts, museums, or sometimes by the operators themselves as part of a <a href="heritage%20fleet">heritage fleet</a>. These buses often need to undergo a degree of <a href="vehicle%20restoration">vehicle restoration</a> to restore them to their original condition and will have their livery and other details such as internal notices and <a href="rollsign">rollsign</a>s restored to be authentic to a specific time in the bus's actual history. Some buses that undergo preservation are rescued from a state of great disrepair, but others enter preservation with very little wrong with them. As with other historic vehicles, many preserved buses either in a working or static state form part of the collections of <a href="List%20of%20transport%20museums">transport museums</a>. Working buses will often be exhibited at rallies and events, and they are also used as charter buses. While many preserved buses are quite old or even vintage, in some cases, relatively new examples of a bus type can enter restoration. In-service examples are still in use by other operators. This often happens when a change in design or operating practice, such as the switch to one person operation or low floor technology, renders some buses redundant while still relatively new.

The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. In March 2017, <a href="TripAdvisor">TripAdvisor</a> named the island the world's top destination in its Traveler's choice award.

Bali is part of the <a href="Coral%20Triangle">Coral Triangle</a>, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species. In this area alone over 500 reef building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about 7 times as many as in the entire Caribbean. Most recently, Bali was the host of the 2011 ASEAN Summit, <a href="APEC%20Indonesia%202013">2013 APEC</a> and <a href="Miss%20World%202013">Miss World 2013</a>. Bali is the home of the <a href="Subak%20%28irrigation%29">Subak</a> Irrigation System, a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> World Heritage Site. It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms, composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, where each house rules a specific geographic area. the confederation is the successor of the <a href="Bali%20Kingdom">Bali Kingdom</a>. The royal houses are not recognized by the government of Indonesia, however, they have been operational since their establishment prior to Dutch colonization.

Bali was inhabited around 2000 BC by <a href="Austronesian%20people">Austronesian people</a> who migrated originally from Southeast Asia and <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a> through <a href="Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">Maritime Southeast Asia</a>. Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines and Oceania. Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.

In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Waisnawa, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.

Inscriptions from 896 and 911 don't mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="Sivaism">Sivaism</a> were practiced simultaneously. <a href="Mpu%20Sindok">Mpu Sindok</a>'s great-granddaughter, <a href="Mahendradatta">Mahendradatta</a> (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king <a href="Udayana%20Warmadewa">Udayana Warmadewa</a> (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to <a href="Airlangga">Airlangga</a> around 1001. This marriage also brought more <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in 1204.

Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name "Bali dwipa" ("Bali island") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by <a href="Sri%20Kesari%20Warmadewa">Sri Kesari Warmadewa</a> in 914 AD and mentioning "Walidwipa". It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system "<a href="Subak%20%28irrigation%29">subak</a>" to grow rice in <a href="wet-field%20cultivation">wet-field cultivation</a>. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.

The Hindu <a href="Majapahit%20Empire">Majapahit Empire</a> (1293–1520 AD) on eastern <a href="Java%20%28island%29">Java</a> founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of <a href="Hayam%20Wuruk">Hayam Wuruk</a> is mentioned in the charters of 1384–86. A mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the <a href="Majapahit%20Empire">Majapahit Empire</a> fell in 1520. Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906, when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.

The first known <a href="European%20ethnic%20groups">European</a> contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by <a href="Antonio%20Abreu">Antonio Abreu</a> and <a href="Francisco%20Serr%C3%A3o">Francisco Serrão</a> sighted its northern shores. It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition. In 1585, a ship foundered off the <a href="Bukit%20Peninsula">Bukit Peninsula</a> and left a few Portuguese in the service of <a href="Dewa%20Agung">Dewa Agung</a>.

In 1597 the Dutch explorer <a href="Cornelis%20de%20Houtman">Cornelis de Houtman</a> arrived at Bali, and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> was established in 1602. The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other. In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.

In June 1860 the famous Welsh naturalist, <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at Buleleng on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his <a href="Wallace%20Line">Wallace Line</a> theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and Lombok. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir "<a href="The%20Malay%20Archipelago">The Malay Archipelago</a>," Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the <a href="Subak%20%28irrigation%29">unique Balinese irrigation methods</a>:

I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of <a href="coconut%20palms">coconut palms</a>, <a href="tamarind">tamarind</a> and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe. 

The Dutch mounted large naval and ground <a href="Dutch%20intervention%20in%20Bali%20%281906%29">assaults at the Sanur region</a> in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide ("<a href="puputan">puputan</a>") to avoid the humiliation of surrender. Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender. In the <a href="Dutch%20intervention%20in%20Bali%20%281908%29">Dutch intervention in Bali</a>, a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in <a href="Klungkung">Klungkung</a>. Afterward the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Maluku</a>.

In the 1930s, anthropologists <a href="Margaret%20Mead">Margaret Mead</a> and <a href="Gregory%20Bateson">Gregory Bateson</a>, artists <a href="Miguel%20Covarrubias">Miguel Covarrubias</a> and <a href="Walter%20Spies">Walter Spies</a>, and musicologist <a href="Colin%20McPhee">Colin McPhee</a> all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as "an enchanted land of <a href="Aesthetics">aesthetes</a> at peace with themselves and nature." Western tourists began to visit the island. The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the west by a quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary "Virgins of Bali" about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls whom the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene "bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies". Under the looser version of the Haynes code that existed up to 1934, nudity involving "civilized" (i.e. white) women was banned, but permitted with "uncivilized" (i.e. all non-white women), a loophole that was exploited by the producers of "Virgins of Bali". The film, which mostly consisted of scenes of topless Balinese women was a great success in 1932, and almost single-handily made Bali into a popular spot for tourists.

<a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a> occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> were inoperative due to heavy rains, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20East%20Indies%20Army">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a> (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps "Prajoda" (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer [Senur]. The island was quickly captured.

During the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, <a href="I%20Gusti%20Ngurah%20Rai">Gusti Ngurah Rai</a>, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The harshness of Japanese occupation forces made them more resented than the Dutch colonial rulers.

In 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed <a href="State%20of%20East%20Indonesia">State of East Indonesia</a>, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a> and <a href="Mohammad%20Hatta">Hatta</a>. Bali was included in the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia" when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949. The first governor of Bali, <a href="Anak%20Agung%20Bagus%20Suteja">Anak Agung Bagus Suteja</a>, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.

The 1963 eruption of <a href="Mount%20Agung">Mount Agung</a> killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be <a href="Transmigration%20program">transmigrated</a> to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional <a href="caste%20system">caste system</a>, and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the <a href="Indonesian%20Communist%20Party">Indonesian Communist Party</a> (PKI) and the <a href="Indonesian%20Nationalist%20Party">Indonesian Nationalist Party</a> (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs. <a href="30%20September%20Movement">An attempted coup</a> in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.

The army became the dominant power as it instigated <a href="Indonesian%20killings%20of%201965%E2%80%9366">a violent anti-communist purge</a>, in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population. With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.

As a result of the 1965-66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno <a href="Transition%20to%20the%20New%20Order">out of the presidency</a>. His <a href="New%20Order%20%28Indonesia%29">"New Order"</a> government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as "paradise" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country. <a href="2002%20Bali%20bombings">A bombing in 2002</a> by militant <a href="Islamist">Islamist</a>s in the tourist area of <a href="Kuta">Kuta</a> killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and <a href="2005%20Bali%20bombings">another in 2005</a>, severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship to the island.

The island of Bali lies 3.2 km (2 mi) east of <a href="Java%20%28island%29">Java</a>, and is approximately <a href="8th%20parallel%20south">8 degrees south</a> of the <a href="equator">equator</a>. Bali and Java are separated by the <a href="Bali%20Strait">Bali Strait</a>. East to west, the island is approximately 153 km (95 mi) wide and spans approximately 112 km (69 mi) north to south; administratively it covers 5,780 km, or 5,577 km without <a href="Nusa%20Penida">Nusa Penida</a> District, its population density is roughly 750 people/km.

Bali's central mountains include several peaks over in elevation and active volcanoes such as <a href="Mount%20Batur">Mount Batur</a>. The highest is <a href="Mount%20Agung">Mount Agung</a> (), known as the "mother mountain" which is an active <a href="volcano">volcano</a> rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years. Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, <a href="Ayung%20River">Ayung River</a>, flows approximately 75 km (see <a href="List%20of%20rivers%20of%20Bali">List of rivers of Bali</a>).

The island is surrounded by <a href="coral%20reefs">coral reefs</a>. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have <a href="black%20sand">black sand</a>. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small "<a href="sampan">sampan</a>" boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of <a href="Tanah%20Lot">Tanah Lot</a>, they are not yet used for significant tourism.

The largest city is the provincial capital, <a href="Denpasar">Denpasar</a>, near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500 (2002). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, <a href="Singaraja">Singaraja</a>, which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people. Other important cities include the beach resort, <a href="Kuta">Kuta</a>, which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and <a href="Ubud">Ubud</a>, situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.

Three small islands lie to the immediate south east and all are administratively part of the <a href="Klungkung">Klungkung</a> regency of Bali: <a href="Nusa%20Penida">Nusa Penida</a>, <a href="Nusa%20Lembongan">Nusa Lembongan</a> and <a href="Nusa%20Ceningan">Nusa Ceningan</a>. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.

To the east, the <a href="Lombok%20Strait">Lombok Strait</a> separates Bali from <a href="Lombok">Lombok</a> and marks the <a href="Biogeography">biogeographical</a> division between the fauna of the <a href="Indomalaya">Indomalaya</a>n <a href="ecozone">ecozone</a> and the distinctly different fauna of <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>. The transition is known as the <a href="Wallace%20Line">Wallace Line</a>, named after <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major <a href="biome">biome</a>s. When sea levels dropped during the <a href="quaternary%20glaciation">Pleistocene ice age</a>, Bali was connected to Java and <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the <a href="Lesser%20Sunda%20Islands">Lesser Sunda archipelago</a> isolated.

Being just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around 30°C with a humidity level of about 85%.

Day time temperatures at low elevations vary between 20–33°C (68–91°F), although it can be much cooler than that in the mountains. The west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. Outside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.

The high season in Bali is during the "dry season" in July and August, as well as during the Easter and Christmas holidays, when the weather is very unpredictable.

Bali lies just to the west of the <a href="Wallace%20Line">Wallace Line</a>, and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok. An exception is the <a href="yellow-crested%20cockatoo">yellow-crested cockatoo</a>, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered <a href="Bali%20myna">Bali myna</a>, which is <a href="endemism">endemic</a>. Others include <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a>, <a href="black-naped%20oriole">black-naped oriole</a>, <a href="black%20racket-tailed%20treepie">black racket-tailed treepie</a>, <a href="crested%20serpent-eagle">crested serpent-eagle</a>, <a href="crested%20treeswift">crested treeswift</a>, <a href="dollarbird">dollarbird</a>, <a href="Java%20sparrow">Java sparrow</a>, <a href="lesser%20adjutant">lesser adjutant</a>, <a href="long-tailed%20shrike">long-tailed shrike</a>, <a href="milky%20stork">milky stork</a>, <a href="Pacific%20swallow">Pacific swallow</a>, <a href="red-rumped%20swallow">red-rumped swallow</a>, <a href="sacred%20kingfisher">sacred kingfisher</a>, <a href="Sea%20eagle%20%28bird%29">sea eagle</a>, <a href="woodswallow">woodswallow</a>, <a href="savanna%20nightjar">savanna nightjar</a>, <a href="stork-billed%20kingfisher">stork-billed kingfisher</a>, <a href="yellow-vented%20bulbul">yellow-vented bulbul</a> and <a href="great%20egret">great egret</a>.

Until the early 20th century, Bali was home to several large mammals: the wild <a href="banteng">banteng</a>, <a href="leopard">leopard</a> and the endemic <a href="Bali%20tiger">Bali tiger</a>. The banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.
<a href="Squirrel">Squirrel</a>s are quite commonly encountered, less often is the <a href="Asian%20palm%20civet">Asian palm civet</a>, which is also kept in coffee farms to produce <a href="Kopi%20Luwak">Kopi Luwak</a>. <a href="Bat">Bat</a>s are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of <a href="Old%20World%20monkey">monkey</a> occur. The <a href="crab-eating%20macaque">crab-eating macaque</a>, known locally as "kera", is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three "monkey forest" temples, such as the popular one in the <a href="Ubud">Ubud</a> area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the <a href="Javan%20langur">Javan langur</a>, locally known as "lutung". They occur in few places apart from the <a href="Bali%20Barat%20National%20Park">Bali Barat National Park</a>. They are born an orange colour, though by their first year they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration. In Java however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and so you can see a mixture of black and orange monkeys together as a family. Other rarer mammals include the <a href="leopard%20cat">leopard cat</a>, <a href="Sunda%20pangolin">Sunda pangolin</a> and <a href="black%20giant%20squirrel">black giant squirrel</a>.

Snakes include the <a href="king%20cobra">king cobra</a> and <a href="reticulated%20python">reticulated python</a>. The <a href="Asian%20water%20monitor">water monitor</a> can grow to at least in length and and can move quickly.

The rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as <a href="Tulamben">Tulamben</a>, <a href="Amed%20%28Bali%29">Amed</a>, Menjangan or neighbouring <a href="Nusa%20Penida">Nusa Penida</a>, host a wide range of marine life, for instance <a href="hawksbill%20turtle">hawksbill turtle</a>, <a href="Mola%20mola">giant sunfish</a>, <a href="Manta%20ray">giant manta ray</a>, <a href="Giant%20moray">giant moray eel</a>, <a href="bumphead%20parrotfish">bumphead parrotfish</a>, <a href="hammerhead%20shark">hammerhead shark</a>, <a href="Grey%20reef%20shark">reef shark</a>, <a href="barracuda">barracuda</a>, and <a href="sea%20snake">sea snake</a>s. Dolphins are commonly encountered on the north coast near <a href="Singaraja">Singaraja</a> and <a href="Lovina">Lovina</a>.

A team of scientists conducted a survey from 29 April 2011 to 11 May 2011 at 33 sea sites around Bali. They discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at <a href="Pemuteran">Pemuteran</a>, <a href="Gilimanuk">Gilimanuk</a>, <a href="Nusa%20Dua">Nusa Dua</a>, <a href="Tulamben">Tulamben</a> and <a href="Candidasa">Candidasa</a>, and 393 coral species, including two new ones at <a href="Padangbai">Padangbai</a> and between Padangbai and <a href="Amed%20%28Bali%29">Amed</a>. The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in <a href="Raja%20Ampat">Raja Ampat</a> and <a href="Halmahera">Halmahera</a> by 29% or in <a href="Fakfak">Fakfak</a> and <a href="Kaimana">Kaimana</a> by 25%) with the highest coverage found in <a href="Gili%20Selang">Gili Selang</a> and <a href="Gili%20Mimpang">Gili Mimpang</a> in <a href="Candidasa">Candidasa</a>, <a href="Karangasem%20Regency">Karangasem regency</a>.

Among the larger trees the most common are: <a href="banyan">banyan</a> trees, <a href="jackfruit">jackfruit</a>, <a href="coconut">coconut</a>s, <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> species, <a href="acacia">acacia</a> trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species. Numerous flowers can be seen: <a href="hibiscus">hibiscus</a>, <a href="frangipani">frangipani</a>, <a href="bougainvillea">bougainvillea</a>, <a href="poinsettia">poinsettia</a>, <a href="oleander">oleander</a>, <a href="jasmine">jasmine</a>, <a href="Nymphaeaceae">water lily</a>, <a href="Nelumbo">lotus</a>, <a href="rose">rose</a>s, <a href="begonia">begonia</a>s, orchids and <a href="hydrangea">hydrangea</a>s exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around <a href="Kintamani%2C%20Bali">Kintamani</a>, certain species of <a href="fern">fern</a> trees, <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s and even <a href="pine">pine</a> trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: <a href="salak">salak</a>, <a href="mangosteen">mangosteen</a>, <a href="Maize">corn</a>, kintamani orange, coffee and <a href="water%20spinach">water spinach</a>.

Some of the worst erosion has occurred in <a href="Lebih%20Beach">Lebih Beach</a>, where up to of land is lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to <a href="Masceti%20Beach">Masceti Beach</a>.

From ranked third in previous review, in 2010 Bali got score 99.65 of Indonesia's environmental quality index and the highest of all the 33 provinces. The score measured three water quality parameters: the level of <a href="total%20suspended%20solids">total suspended solids</a> (TSS), <a href="dissolved%20oxygen">dissolved oxygen</a> (DO) and <a href="chemical%20oxygen%20demand">chemical oxygen demand</a> (COD).

Because of over-exploitation by the tourist industry which covers a massive land area, 200 out of 400 rivers on the island have dried up and based on research, the southern part of Bali would face a water shortage up to 2,500 litres of clean water per second by 2015.
To ease the shortage, the central government plans to build a water catchment and processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 litres capacity of water per second will be channelled to Denpasar, Badung and Gianyar in 2013.

The province is divided into eight <a href="Regencies%20of%20Indonesia">regencies</a> ("kabupaten") and one <a href="Cities%20of%20Indonesia">city</a> ("kota"). These are:

In 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment. Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related. By end of June 2011, <a href="non-performing%20loan">non-performing loan</a> of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan (about 5%). The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the terrorist bombings <a href="2002%20Bali%20bombing">2002</a> and <a href="2005%20Bali%20bombing">2005</a>. The tourism industry has since recovered from these events.

Although tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer. Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its <a href="artisan">artisan</a>s who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including <a href="batik">batik</a> and <a href="ikat">ikat</a> <a href="Bali%20Nusra%20Tangi">cloth and clothing</a>, <a href="Woodworking">wooden carvings</a>, stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.

The Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near <a href="Mount%20Batur">Mount Batur</a>. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes. Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called <a href="Subak%20%28irrigation%29">Subak Abian</a>, which is based on the <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> philosophy of "<a href="Tri%20Hita%20Karana">Tri Hita Karana</a>". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people, and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of <a href="fair%20trade%20coffee">fair trade</a> and <a href="organic%20coffee">organic coffee</a> production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a <a href="geographical%20indication">geographical indication</a>.

In 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in <a href="Sanur%2C%20Bali">Sanur</a> was built by <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>, and boosted tourism in Bali. Prior to it, only three hotels existed on the island. Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased on Bali after the <a href="Ngurah%20Rai%20International%20Airport">Ngurah Rai International Airport</a> opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.

The <a href="tourism%20industry">tourism industry</a> is primarily focused in the south, while significant in the other parts of the island as well. The main tourist locations are the town of <a href="Kuta">Kuta</a> (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and <a href="Seminyak">Seminyak</a> (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of <a href="Sanur%20%28Bali%29">Sanur</a> (once the only tourist hub), <a href="Ubud">Ubud</a> towards the center of the island, to the south of the <a href="Ngurah%20Rai%20International%20Airport">Ngurah Rai International Airport</a>, <a href="Jimbaran">Jimbaran</a>, and the newer developments of <a href="Nusa%20Dua">Nusa Dua</a> and <a href="Pecatu">Pecatu</a>.

The United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012 because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning. Australia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015 due to new terrorist threats.

An offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Million dollar villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic (many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active) investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.

In the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors value for their currencies. Visitor arrivals for 2009 were forecast to drop 8% (which would be higher than 2007 levels), mainly due to the worldwide economic crisis which has also affected the global tourist industry.

Bali's tourism economy survived the terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has in fact slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0–2.3 million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels, although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.

Bali received the Best Island award from <a href="Travel%20and%20Leisure">Travel and Leisure</a> in 2010. Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after <a href="Santorini">Santorini</a>, Greece.

In August 2010, the film "<a href="Eat%20Pray%20Love">Eat Pray Love</a>" was released in theatres. The movie was based on <a href="Elizabeth%20Gilbert">Elizabeth Gilbert</a>'s best-selling memoir "<a href="Eat%2C%20Pray%2C%20Love">Eat, Pray, Love</a>". It took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach at Bali. The 2006 book, which spent 57 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the "New York Times" paperback nonfiction best-seller list, had already fuelled a boom in "Eat, Pray, Love"-related tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist center that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance through traditional spirituality and healing that leads to love.

In January 2016, after music icon <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a> died, it was revealed that in his <a href="will%20and%20testament">will</a>, Bowie asked for his ashes to be scattered in Bali, conforming to <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> rituals. He had visited and performed in a number of <a href="Southeast%20Asian">Southeast Asian</a> cities early in his career, including <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>.

Since 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list. Chinese tourists increased by 17% from last year due to the impact of <a href="ACFTA">ACFTA</a> and new direct flights to Bali.
In January 2012, Chinese tourists year on year (yoy) increased by 222.18% compared to January 2011, while Japanese tourists declined by 23.54% yoy.

Bali reported that it welcomed 2.88 million foreign tourists and 5 million domestic tourists in 2012, marginally surpassing the expectations of 2.8 million foreign tourists.

Based on a <a href="Bank%20Indonesia">Bank Indonesia</a> survey in May 2013, 34.39 percent of tourists are upper-middle class, spending between $1,286 to $5,592, and are dominated by Australia, France, China, Germany and the US. Some Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 percent of tourists are middle class, spending between $662 to $1,285.

The <a href="Ngurah%20Rai%20Airport">Ngurah Rai International Airport</a> is located near Jimbaran, on the <a href="isthmus">isthmus</a> at the southernmost part of the island. <a href="Lt.Col.%20Wisnu%20Airfield">Lt.Col. Wisnu Airfield</a> is found in north-west Bali.

A coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching to 1,750m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines.

In December 2010 the Government of Indonesia invited investors to build a new Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal at <a href="Karangasem%20Regency">Karangasem</a>, Bali with a projected worth of $30 million. On 17 July 2011 the first cruise ship (<a href="Sun%20Princess">Sun Princess</a>) anchored about away from the wharf of Tanah Ampo harbour. The current pier is only but will eventually be extended to to accommodate international cruise ships. The harbour here is safer than the existing facility at Benoa and has a scenic backdrop of east Bali mountains and green rice fields. The tender for improvement was subject to delays, and as of July 2013 the situation remained unclear with cruise line operators complaining and even refusing to use the existing facility at Tanah Ampo.

A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by two ministers, Bali's Governor and <a href="PT%20Kereta%20Api">Indonesian Train Company</a> to build of railway along the coast around the island. As of July 2015, no details of this proposed railways have been released.

On 16 March 2011 (Tanjung) Benoa port received the "Best Port Welcome 2010" award from London's "Dream World Cruise Destination" magazine. Government plans to expand the role of Benoa port as export-import port to boost Bali's trade and industry sector. The Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry has confirmed that 306 cruise liners are heading for Indonesia in 2013 – an increase of 43 percent compared to the previous year.

In May 2011, an integrated Aerial Traffic Control System (ATCS) was implemented to reduce traffic jams at four crossing points: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing. ATCS is an integrated system connecting all <a href="traffic%20lights">traffic lights</a>, CCTVs and other traffic signals with a monitoring office at the police headquarters. It has successfully been implemented in other ASEAN countries and will be implemented at other crossings in Bali.

On 21 December 2011 construction started on the Nusa Dua-Benoa-<a href="Ngurah%20Rai%20International%20Airport">Ngurah Rai International Airport</a> toll road which will also provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the toll road (totally with access road). The construction is estimated to cost Rp.2.49 trillion ($273.9 million). The project goes through of mangrove forest and through of beach, both within area. The elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars which occupied 2 hectares of mangroves forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road. On 21 December 2011 the Dewa Ruci underpass has also started on the busy Dewa Ruci junction near Bali Kuta Galeria with an estimated cost of Rp136 billion ($14.9 million) from the state budget. On 23 September 2013, the <a href="Bali%20Mandara%20Toll%20Road">Bali Mandara Toll Road</a> was opened, with the Dewa Ruci Junction (Simpang Siur) underpass being opened previously.

To solve chronic traffic problems, the province will also build a toll road connecting Serangan with <a href="Tohpati">Tohpati</a>, a toll road connecting Kuta, Denpasar and Tohpati and a flyover connecting Kuta and Ngurah Rai Airport.

The population of Bali was 3,890,757 as of the 2010 Census; the latest estimate (for January 2014) is 4,225,384. There are an estimated 30,000 expatriates living in Bali.

A DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al. found that 12% of Balinese <a href="Y-chromosome">Y-chromosome</a>s are of likely Indian origin, while 84% are of likely <a href="Austronesian">Austronesian</a> origin, and 2% of likely <a href="Melanesian">Melanesian</a> origin. The study does not correlate the DNA samples to the Balinese caste system.

Pre-modern Bali has had four castes, state Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis, but with a "very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence". The four castes have been classified as Soedra (<a href="Shudra">Shudra</a>), Wesia (<a href="Vaishya">Vaishya</a>s), <a href="Balinese%20Kshatriya">Satrias</a> (<a href="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a>s) and Brahmana (<a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>).

The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that Balinese caste had Indian origins, but states Helen Creese, scholars such as Brumund who visited and stayed the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the "received understandings concerning its Indian origins". In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelled "Soedra") have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be from the other three castes. In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite "meweda" (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.

Unlike most of Muslim-majority Indonesia, about 83.5% of Bali's population adheres to <a href="Balinese%20Hinduism">Balinese Hinduism</a>, formed as a combination of existing <a href="Balinese%20mythology">local beliefs</a> and <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions include Islam (13.37%), Christianity (2.47%), and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> (0.5%). These figures do not include immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.

The general beliefs and practices of "Agama Hindu Dharma" are a mixture of ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of <a href="Pancasila%20%28politics%29">"panca sila"</a>. Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray. However, officially, Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognized beliefs that comply with its national ideology. Indonesian school text books describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam. Scholars contest whether these Indonesian government recognized and assigned beliefs reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.

Balinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, that arrived through <a href="Java">Java</a>. Hindu influences reached the <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Indonesia">Indonesian Archipelago</a> as early as the first century. Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to <a href="78%20AD">78 AD</a>. Stories from the <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; however, the versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> and southern <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>).

The Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualizing states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.

Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist <a href="Chinese%20Indonesian">Chinese</a> immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's "<a href="odalan">odalan</a>". Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese. Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.

<a href="Balinese%20language">Balinese</a> and <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian</a> are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of <a href="Balinese%20people">Balinese people</a> are <a href="bilingual">bilingual</a> or <a href="trilingual">trilingual</a>. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from Java, Lombok, Sumatra, and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the <a href="Balinese%20caste%20system">Balinese caste system</a> and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. <a href="Kawi%20language">Kawi</a> and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, for Hinduism literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.

English and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the <a href="tourism%20industry">tourism industry</a>, as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as Japanese, <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a>, French, Russian or German are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.

Bali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. <a href="Balinese%20cuisine">Balinese cuisine</a> is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as "<a href="gamelan">gamelan</a>", is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous <a href="Balinese%20dance">Balinese dance</a>s include "<a href="pendet">pendet</a>", "<a href="legong">legong</a>", "<a href="baris%20%28dance%29">baris</a>", "<a href="topeng">topeng</a>", "<a href="barong%20%28mythology%29">barong</a>", "<a href="Gamelan%20gong%20kebyar">gong keybar</a>", and "<a href="kecak">kecak</a>" (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.
The Hindu New Year, "<a href="Nyepi">Nyepi</a>", is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of "ogoh-ogoh" monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese "<a href="pawukon">pawukon</a>" <a href="calendar">calendrical</a> system.

Celebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), <a href="Ngaben">cremation</a> or "odalan" (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of "désa kala patra", which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context. Many of the ceremonial art forms such as "<a href="wayang">wayang kulit</a>" and "<a href="topeng">topeng</a>" are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation. Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, "ramé", is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more "<a href="Music%20of%20Bali">gamelan</a>" ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of "ramé".
"Kaja" and "kelod" are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung ("kaja"), and the sea ("kelod"). In addition to spatial orientation, "kaja" and "kelod" have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.

Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest "kaja". These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as "wali", the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where "bebali" ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called "bali-balihan". This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.

Tourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of <a href="tourism%20in%20indonesia">tourism</a> is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the "<a href="barong%20%28mythology%29">barong</a>" <a href="Balinese%20dance">dance</a> have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a "barong" mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.

Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied. Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as <a href="customary%20law">customary law</a> sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including "<a href="kasepekang">kasepekang</a>", or <a href="shunning">shunning</a>) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.

Bali is a major world <a href="surfing">surfing</a> destination with popular breaks dotted across the southern coastline and around the offshore island of <a href="Nusa%20Lembongan">Nusa Lembongan</a>.

As part of the <a href="Coral%20Triangle">Coral Triangle</a>, Bali, including <a href="Nusa%20Penida">Nusa Penida</a>, offers a wide range of dive sites with varying types of reefs.

Bali was the host of <a href="2008%20Asian%20Beach%20Games">2008 Asian Beach Games</a>. It was the second time Indonesia hosted an Asia-level <a href="multi-sport%20event">multi-sport event</a>, after <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> held the <a href="1962%20Asian%20Games">1962 Asian Games</a>.

The team was relocated from <a href="Samarinda">Samarinda</a>, <a href="East%20Kalimantan">East Kalimantan</a> to <a href="Gianyar">Gianyar</a>, Bali. Harbiansyah Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he did the name change and moved the homebase to Bali because there were no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia. Another reason was due to local fans in Samarinda prefer to support <a href="Pusamania%20Borneo%20F.C.">Pusamania Borneo F.C.</a> more than Persisam.

Bulgarian language

Bulgarian , ( "bǎlgarski", ) is an <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European language</a>, a member of the <a href="South%20Slavic%20languages">Southern</a> branch of the <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> language family.

Bulgarian, along with the closely related <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian language</a> (collectively forming the <a href="East%20South%20Slavic%20languages">East South Slavic languages</a>), has several characteristics that set it apart from all other <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic languages</a>: changes include the elimination of <a href="grammatical%20case">case declension</a>, the development of a suffixed <a href="definite%20article">definite article</a> (see <a href="Balkan%20language%20area">Balkan language area</a>), and the lack of a verb <a href="infinitive">infinitive</a>, but it retains and has further developed the <a href="Proto-Slavic%20language">Proto-Slavic</a> verb system. Various <a href="evidentiality">evidential</a> verb forms exist to express unwitnessed, retold, and doubtful action.

With the <a href="accession%20of%20Bulgaria%20to%20the%20European%20Union">accession of Bulgaria to the European Union</a> on 1 January 2007, Bulgarian became one of the official languages of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>.

Development of the Bulgarian language may be divided into several periods.


"Bulgarian" was the first "Slavic" language attested in writing. As Slavic linguistic unity lasted into late antiquity, in the oldest manuscripts this language was initially referred to as языкъ словяньскъ, "the Slavic language". In the Middle Bulgarian period this name was gradually replaced by the name , the "Bulgarian language". In some cases, the name was used not only with regard to the contemporary Middle Bulgarian language of the copyist but also to the period of Old Bulgarian. A most notable example of anachronism is the Service of <a href="Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius">St. Cyril</a> from Skopje (Скопски миней), a 13th-century Middle Bulgarian manuscript from northern <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> according to which St. Cyril preached with "Bulgarian" books among the Moravian Slavs. The first mention of the language as the "Bulgarian language" instead of the "Slavonic language" comes in the work of the Greek clergy of the <a href="Bulgarian%20Archbishopric%20of%20Ohrid">Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid</a> in the 11th century, for example in the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> hagiography of <a href="Saint%20Clement%20of%20Ohrid">Saint Clement of Ohrid</a> by <a href="Theophylact%20of%20Bulgaria">Theophylact</a> of Ohrid (late 11th century).

During the Middle Bulgarian period, the language underwent dramatic changes, losing the Slavonic case system, but preserving the rich verb system (while the development was exactly the opposite in other Slavic languages) and developing a definite article. It was influenced by its non-Slavic neighbors in the <a href="Balkan%20language%20area">Balkan language area</a> (mostly grammatically) and later also by <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>, which was the official language of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, in the form of the <a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish language</a>, mostly lexically. As a <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">national revival</a> occurred toward the end of the period of Ottoman rule (mostly during the 19th century), a modern Bulgarian literary language gradually emerged that drew heavily on <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic%20language">Church Slavonic/Old Bulgarian</a> (and to some extent on literary <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>, which had preserved many lexical items from Church Slavonic) and later reduced the number of Turkish and other Balkan loans. Today one difference between Bulgarian dialects in the country and literary spoken Bulgarian is the significant presence of Old Bulgarian words and even word forms in the latter. Russian loans are distinguished from Old Bulgarian ones on the basis of the presence of specifically Russian phonetic changes, as in оборот (turnover, rev), непонятен (incomprehensible), ядро (nucleus) and others. As usual in such cases, many other loans from French, English and the <a href="classical%20language">classical language</a>s have subsequently entered the language as well.

Modern Bulgarian was based essentially on the Eastern dialects of the language, but its pronunciation is in many respects a compromise between East and West Bulgarian (see especially the phonetic sections below). Following the efforts of some figures of the <a href="National%20awakening%20of%20Bulgaria">National awakening of Bulgaria</a> (the most notable among them being <a href="Neofit%20Rilski">Neofit Rilski</a> and <a href="Ivan%20Bogorov">Ivan Bogorov</a>), there had been many attempts to <a href="Codification%20%28linguistics%29">codify</a> a <a href="Standard%20language">standard</a> Bulgarian language; however, there was much argument surrounding the choice of norms. Between 1835–1878 more than 25 proposals were put forward and "linguistic chaos" ensued. Eventually the eastern dialects prevailed, and in 1899 the Ministry of Education officially codified a standard Bulgarian language based on the Drinov-Ivanchev orthography.

The language is mainly split into two broad dialect areas, based on the different reflexes of the <a href="Common%20Slavic%20language">Common Slavic</a> <a href="yat">yat</a> vowel (Ѣ). This split, which occurred at some point during the Middle Ages, led to the development of Bulgaria's:

The literary language norm, which is generally based on the Eastern dialects, also has the Eastern alternating reflex of "yat". However, it has not incorporated the general Eastern umlaut of "all" synchronic or even historic "ya" sounds into "e" before front vowels – e.g. поляна ("polyana") vs. полени ("poleni") "meadow – meadows" or even жаба ("zhaba") vs. жеби ("zhebi") "frog – frogs", even though it co-occurs with the yat alternation in almost all Eastern dialects that have it (except a few dialects along the yat border, e.g. in the <a href="Pleven">Pleven</a> region).

More examples of the "yat" umlaut in the literary language are:

Until 1945, Bulgarian orthography did not reveal this alternation and used the original <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic">Old Slavic</a> <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> letter "yat" (Ѣ), which was commonly called двойно е ("dvoyno e") at the time, to express the historical "yat" vowel or at least root vowels displaying the "ya – e" alternation. The letter was used in each occurrence of such a root, regardless of the actual pronunciation of the vowel: thus, both "mlyako" and "mlekar" were spelled with (Ѣ). Among other things, this was seen as a way to "reconcile" the Western and the Eastern dialects and maintain language unity at a time when much of Bulgaria's Western dialect area was controlled by <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, but there were still hopes and occasional attempts to recover it. With the 1945 orthographic reform, this letter was abolished and the present spelling was introduced, reflecting the alternation in pronunciation.

This had implications for some grammatical constructions:

Sometimes, with the changes, words began to be spelled as other words with different meanings, e.g.:

In spite of the literary norm regarding the yat vowel, many people living in Western Bulgaria, including the capital <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, will fail to observe its rules. While the norm requires the realizations "vidyal" vs. "videli" (he has seen; they have seen), some natives of Western Bulgaria will preserve their local dialect pronunciation with "e" for all instances of "yat" (e.g. "videl", "videli"). Others, attempting to adhere to the norm, will actually use the "ya" sound even in cases where the standard language has "e" (e.g. "vidyal", "vidyali"). The latter <a href="hypercorrection%23Bulgarian">hypercorrection</a> is called свръхякане ("svrah-yakane" ≈"over-"ya"-ing").

Bulgarian is the only Slavic language whose literary standard does not naturally contain the <a href="Iotation">iotated</a> sound (or its palatalized variant , except in non-Slavic foreign-loaned words). The sound is common in all modern Slavic languages (e.g. <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a> "medvěd" "bear", <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a> "pięć" "five", <a href="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a> jelen" "deer", <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> "немає "there is not...", <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a> "пишување" "writing", etc.), as well as some Western Bulgarian dialectal forms – e.g. "ора̀н’е" (standard Bulgarian: "оране" , "ploughing"), however it is not represented in standard Bulgarian speech or writing. Even where occurs in other Slavic words, in Standard Bulgarian it is usually transcribed and pronounced as pure – e.g. <a href="Boris%20Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> is "Eltsin" (), <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> is "Ekaterinburg" () and <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> is "Saraevo" (), although - because the sound is contained in a stressed syllable at the beginning of the word - <a href="Jelena%20Jankovi%C4%87">Jelena Janković</a> is "Yelena" – .

Until the period immediately following the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, all Bulgarian and the majority of foreign linguists referred to the <a href="South%20Slavic%20dialect%20continuum">South Slavic dialect continuum</a> spanning the area of modern Bulgaria, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> and parts of <a href="Northern%20Greece">Northern Greece</a> as a group of Bulgarian dialects. In contrast, Serbian sources tended to label them "south Serbian" dialects. Some local naming conventions included "bolgarski", "bugarski" and so forth. The codifiers of the standard Bulgarian language, however, did not wish to make any allowances for a <a href="Pluricentric%20language">pluricentric</a> "Bulgaro-Macedonian" compromise. After 1944 the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Bulgaria">People's Republic of Bulgaria</a> and the <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> began a policy of making Macedonia into the connecting link for the establishment of a new <a href="Balkan%20Federative%20Republic">Balkan Federative Republic</a> and stimulating here a development of distinct <a href="Slav%20Macedonian">Slav Macedonian</a> consciousness. With the proclamation of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia as part of the Yugoslav federation, the new authorities also started measures that would overcome the pro-Bulgarian feeling among parts of its population and in 1945 a separate <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian language</a> was codified. After 1958, when the pressure from Moscow decreased, Sofia reverted to the view that the Macedonian language did not exist as a separate language. Nowadays, Bulgarian and Greek linguists as well as some linguists from other countries still consider Macedonian dialects as Bulgarian. Outside Bulgaria and Greece, Macedonian is generally considered an <a href="autonomous%20language">autonomous language</a> within the South Slavic dialect continuum. Sociolinguists agree that the question whether Macedonian is a dialect of Bulgarian or a language is a political one and cannot be resolved on a purely linguistic basis, because dialect continua do not allow for either/or judgments.

In 886 AD, the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian Empire</a> introduced the <a href="Glagolitic%20alphabet">Glagolitic alphabet</a> which was devised by the <a href="Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius">Saints Cyril and Methodius</a> in the 850s. The Glagolitic alphabet was gradually superseded in later centuries by the <a href="Cyrillic%20script">Cyrillic script</a>, developed around the <a href="Preslav%20Literary%20School">Preslav Literary School</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> in the beginning of the 10th century.

Several Cyrillic alphabets with 28 to 44 letters were used in the beginning and the middle of the 19th century during the efforts on the codification of Modern Bulgarian until an alphabet with 32 letters, proposed by <a href="Marin%20Drinov">Marin Drinov</a>, gained prominence in the 1870s. The alphabet of Marin Drinov was used until the orthographic reform of 1945, when the letters <a href="Yat">Ѣ</a>, ѣ (called "<a href="w%3Abg%3A%D0%AF%D1%82">ят</a>" 'yat' or "двойно е"/"е-двойно" 'double e'), and <a href="Big%20Yus">Ѫ</a>, ѫ (called "<a href="w%3Abg%3A%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%BC%20%D1%8E%D1%81">Голям юс</a>" 'big yus', "голяма носовка" 'big nasal sign', "ъ кръстато" 'crossed <a href="yer">yer</a>' or "широко ъ" 'long <a href="yer">yer</a>'), were removed from its alphabet, reducing the number of letters to 30.

With the <a href="accession%20of%20Bulgaria%20to%20the%20European%20Union">accession of Bulgaria to the European Union</a> on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, following the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin</a> and <a href="Greek%20script">Greek script</a>s.

Bulgarian possesses a phonology similar to that of the rest of the South Slavic languages, notably lacking Serbo-Croatian's phonemic vowel length and tones and alveo-palatal affricates. The eastern dialects exhibit palatalization of consonants before front vowels ( and ) and reduction of vowel phonemes in unstressed position (causing mergers of and , and , and ) - both patterns have partial parallels in Russian and lead to a partly similar sound. The western dialects are like Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian in that they do not have allophonic palatalization and have only little vowel reduction.

Bulgarian has six vowel phonemes, but at least eight distinct phones can be distinguished when reduced allophones are taken into consideration.

The parts of speech in Bulgarian are divided in 10 types, which are categorized in two broad classes: mutable and immutable. The difference is that mutable parts of speech vary grammatically, whereas the immutable ones do not change, regardless of their use. The five classes of mutables are: "nouns", "adjectives", "numerals", "pronouns" and "verbs". Syntactically, the first four of these form the group of the noun or the nominal group. The immutables are: "adverbs", "prepositions", "conjunctions", "particles" and "interjections". Verbs and adverbs form the group of the verb or the verbal group.

Nouns and adjectives have the <a href="grammatical%20category">categories</a> <a href="grammatical%20gender">grammatical gender</a>, <a href="grammatical%20number">number</a>, <a href="grammatical%20case">case</a> (only <a href="vocative%20case">vocative</a>) and <a href="definite%20article">definiteness</a> in Bulgarian. Adjectives and adjectival pronouns agree with nouns in number and gender. Pronouns have gender and number and retain (as in nearly all <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a>) a more significant part of the case system.

There are three grammatical genders in Bulgarian: "masculine", "feminine" and "neuter". The gender of the noun can largely be inferred from its ending: nouns ending in a consonant ("zero ending") are generally masculine (for example, град 'city', син 'son', мъж 'man'; those ending in –а/–я (-a/-ya) (жена 'woman', дъщеря 'daughter', улица 'street') are normally feminine; and nouns ending in –е, –о are almost always neuter (дете 'child', езеро 'lake'), as are those rare words (usually loanwords) that end in –и, –у, and –ю (цунами 'tsunami', табу 'taboo', меню 'menu'). Perhaps the most significant exception from the above are the relatively numerous nouns that end in a consonant and yet are feminine: these comprise, firstly, a large group of nouns with zero ending expressing quality, degree or an abstraction, including all nouns ending on –ост/–ест -{ost/est} (мъдрост 'wisdom', низост 'vileness', прелест 'loveliness', болест 'sickness', любов 'love'), and secondly, a much smaller group of irregular nouns with zero ending which define tangible objects or concepts (кръв 'blood', кост 'bone', вечер 'evening', нощ 'night'). There are also some commonly used words that end in a vowel and yet are masculine: баща 'father', дядо 'grandfather', чичо / вуйчо 'uncle', and others.

The plural forms of the nouns do not express their gender as clearly as the singular ones, but may also provide some clues to it: the ending –и (-i) is more likely to be used with a masculine or feminine noun (факти 'facts', болести 'sicknesses'), while one in –а/–я belongs more often to a neuter noun (езера 'lakes'). Also, the plural ending –ове occurs only in masculine nouns.

Two numbers are distinguished in Bulgarian – <a href="Grammatical%20number">singular</a> and <a href="plural">plural</a>. A variety of plural suffixes is used, and the choice between them is partly determined by their ending in singular and partly influenced by gender; in addition, irregular declension and alternative plural forms are common. Words ending in –а/–я (which are usually feminine) generally have the plural ending –и, upon dropping of the singular ending. Of nouns ending in a consonant, the feminine ones also use –и, whereas the masculine ones usually have –и for polysyllables and –ове for monosyllables (however, exceptions are especially common in this group). Nouns ending in –о/–е (most of which are neuter) mostly use the suffixes –а, –я (both of which require the dropping of the singular endings) and –та.

With <a href="cardinal%20number">cardinal number</a>s and related words such as няколко ('several'), masculine nouns use a special count form in –а/–я, which stems from the Proto-Slavonic <a href="dual%20grammatical%20number">dual</a>: два/три стола ('two/three chairs') versus тези столове ('these chairs'); cf. feminine две/три/тези книги ('two/three/these books') and neuter две/три/тези легла ('two/three/these beds'). However, a recently developed language norm requires that count forms should only be used with masculine nouns that do not denote persons. Thus, двама/трима ученици ('two/three students') is perceived as more correct than двама/трима ученика, while the distinction is retained in cases such as два/три молива ('two/three pencils') versus тези моливи ('these pencils').

Cases exist only in the <a href="personal%20pronoun">personal</a> and some other <a href="pronoun">pronoun</a>s (as they do in many other modern <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a>), with <a href="nominative%20case">nominative</a>, <a href="accusative%20case">accusative</a>, <a href="dative%20case">dative</a> and <a href="vocative%20case">vocative</a> forms. Vestiges are present in a number of phraseological units and sayings. The major exception are <a href="vocative%20case">vocative</a> forms, which are still in use for masculine (with the endings -е, -о and -ю) and feminine nouns (-[ь/й]о and -е) in the singular.

In modern Bulgarian, definiteness is expressed by a <a href="definite%20article">definite article</a> which is postfixed to the noun, much like in the <a href="Scandinavian%20languages">Scandinavian languages</a> or <a href="Romanian%20language">Romanian</a> (indefinite: човек, 'person'; definite: човекът, ""the" person") or to the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: добър човек, 'a good person'; definite: добрият човек, ""the" good person"). There are four singular definite articles. Again, the choice between them is largely determined by the noun's ending in the singular. Nouns that end in a consonant and are masculine use –ът/–ят, when they are <a href="grammatical%20subject">grammatical subject</a>s, and –а/–я elsewhere. Nouns that end in a consonant and are feminine, as well as nouns that end in –а/–я (most of which are feminine, too) use –та. Nouns that end in –е/–о use –то.

The plural definite article is –те for all nouns except for those, whose plural form ends in –а/–я; these get –та instead. When postfixed to adjectives the definite articles are –ят/–я for masculine gender (again, with the longer form being reserved for grammatical subjects), –та for feminine gender, –то for neuter gender, and –те for plural.


In Bulgarian adjective-noun phrases, only the adjective takes a definite article ending –
Many of the English loanwords which have been adopted into the language since the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989%23Bulgaria">end of communism</a>, however, do not readily lend themselves to taking adjectival endings. This has caused an unprecedented shift in the language whereby, in certain cases, the adjective remains uninflected, while the noun following it takes the grammatical ending. Examples include –

This type of combination is sometimes favoured even when the possibility of a traditional phrase structure exists, e.g. –
In this case, the brand name "btv" cannot be inflected and, being a brand, remains in Roman script within the sentence.

Both groups agree in gender and number with the noun they are appended to. They may also take the definite article as explained above.

Pronouns may vary in gender, number, and definiteness, and are the only parts of speech that have retained case inflections. Three cases are exhibited by some groups of pronouns – nominative, accusative and dative. The distinguishable types of pronouns include the following: personal, relative, reflexive, interrogative, negative, indefinitive, summative and possessive.

The Bulgarian verb can take up to 3,000 distinct forms, as it varies in person, number, voice, aspect, mood, tense and even gender.

Finite verbal forms are "simple" or "compound" and agree with subjects in person (first, second and third) and number (singular, plural) in Bulgarian. In addition to that, past compound forms using participles vary in gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and voice (active and passive) as well as aspect (perfective/aorist and imperfective).

Bulgarian verbs express <a href="lexical%20aspect">lexical aspect</a>: perfective verbs signify the completion of the action of the verb and form past perfective (aorist) forms; imperfective ones are neutral with regard to it and form past imperfective forms. Most Bulgarian verbs can be grouped in perfective-imperfective pairs (imperfective/perfective: идвам/дойда "come", пристигам/пристигна "arrive"). Perfective verbs can be usually formed from imperfective ones by suffixation or prefixation, but the resultant verb often deviates in meaning from the original. In the pair examples above, aspect is stem-specific and therefore there is no difference in meaning.

In Bulgarian, there is also <a href="grammatical%20aspect">grammatical aspect</a>. Three grammatical aspects are distinguishable: neutral, perfect and pluperfect. The neutral aspect comprises the three simple tenses and the future tense. The pluperfect is manifest in tenses that use double or triple auxiliary "be" participles like the past pluperfect subjunctive. Perfect constructions use a single auxiliary "be".

The traditional interpretation is that in addition to the four moods (наклонения ) shared by most other European languages – <a href="indicative%20mood">indicative</a> (изявително, ) <a href="imperative%20mood">imperative</a> (повелително ), <a href="subjunctive%20mood">subjunctive</a> (подчинително ) and <a href="conditional%20mood">conditional</a> (условно, ) – in Bulgarian there is one more to describe a general category of unwitnessed events – the <a href="inferential%20mood">inferential</a> (преизказно ) mood. However, most contemporary Bulgarian linguists usually exclude the subjunctive mood and the inferential mood from the list of Bulgarian moods (thus placing the number of Bulgarian moods at a total of 3: indicative, imperative and conditional) and don't consider them to be moods but view them as verbial morphosyntactic constructs or separate <a href="grameme">grameme</a>s of the verb class. The possible existence of a few other moods has been discussed in the literature. Most Bulgarian school grammars teach the traditional view of 4 Bulgarian moods (as described above, but excluding the subjunctive and including the inferential).

There are three grammatically distinctive positions in time – present, past and future – which combine with aspect and mood to produce a number of formations. Normally, in grammar books these formations are viewed as separate tenses – i. e. "past imperfect" would mean that the verb is in past tense, in the imperfective aspect, and in the indicative mood (since no other mood is shown). There are more than 40 different tenses across Bulgarian's two aspects and five moods.

In the indicative mood, there are three simple tenses:

In the indicative there are also the following compound tenses:

The four perfect constructions above can vary in aspect depending on the aspect of the main-verb participle; they are in fact pairs of imperfective and perfective aspects. Verbs in forms using past participles also vary in voice and gender.

There is only one simple tense in the <a href="imperative%20mood">imperative mood</a>, the present, and there are simple forms only for the second-person singular, -и/-й (-i, -y/i), and plural, -ете/-йте (-ete, -yte), e.g. уча ('to study'): учи , sg., учете , pl.; играя 'to play': играй , играйте . There are compound imperative forms for all persons and numbers in the present compound imperative (да играе, ), the present perfect compound imperative (да е играл, ) and the rarely used present pluperfect compound imperative (да е бил играл, ).

The <a href="conditional%20mood">conditional mood</a> consists of five compound tenses, most of which are not grammatically distinguishable. The present, future and past conditional use a special past form of the stem би- (bi – "be") and the past participle (бих учил, , 'I would study'). The past future conditional and the past future perfect conditional coincide in form with the respective indicative tenses.

The <a href="subjunctive%20mood">subjunctive mood</a> is rarely documented as a separate verb form in Bulgarian, (being, morphologically, a sub-instance of the quasi-<a href="infinitive">infinitive</a> construction with the particle да and a normal finite verb form), but nevertheless it is used regularly. The most common form, often mistaken for the present tense, is the present subjunctive ([по-добре] да отида , 'I had better go'). The difference between the present indicative and the present subjunctive tense is that the subjunctive can be formed by "both" perfective and imperfective verbs. It has completely replaced the infinitive and the supine from complex expressions (see below). It is also employed to express opinion about "possible" future events. The past perfect subjunctive ([по-добре] да бях отишъл , 'I'd had better be gone') refers to "possible" events in the past, which "did not" take place, and the present pluperfect subjunctive (да съм бил отишъл ), which may be used about both past and future events arousing feelings of incontinence, suspicion, etc. and has no perfect to English translation.

The <a href="grammatical%20mood">inferential mood</a> has five pure tenses. Two of them are simple – "past aorist inferential" and "past imperfect inferential" – and are formed by the past participles of perfective and imperfective verbs, respectively. There are also three compound tenses – "past future inferential", "past future perfect inferential" and "past perfect inferential". All these tenses' forms are gender-specific in the singular. There are also conditional and compound-imperative crossovers. The existence of inferential forms has been attributed to Turkic influences by most Bulgarian linguists. Morphologically, they are derived from the <a href="Bulgarian%20language%23Tense">perfect</a>.

Bulgarian has the following <a href="participle">participle</a>s:

The participles are inflected by gender, number, and definiteness, and are coordinated with the subject when forming compound tenses (see tenses above). When used in attributive role the inflection attributes are coordinated with the noun that is being attributed.

Bulgarian uses <a href="reflexive%20verb">reflexive verb</a>al forms (i.e. actions which are performed by the <a href="Agent%20%28grammar%29">agent</a> onto him- or herself) which behave in a similar way as they do in many other Indo-European languages, such as French and Spanish. The reflexive is expressed by the invariable particle se, originally a <a href="clitic">clitic</a> form of the accusative reflexive pronoun. Thus –
When the action is performed on others, other particles are used, just like in any normal verb, e.g. –
Sometimes, the reflexive verb form has a similar but not necessarily identical meaning to the non-reflexive verb –
In other cases, the reflexive verb has a completely different meaning from its non-reflexive counterpart –
When the action is performed on an indirect object, the particles change to si and its derivatives –
In some cases, the particle "si" is ambiguous between the indirect object and the possessive meaning –
The difference between transitive and intransitive verbs can lead to significant differences in meaning with minimal change, e.g. –
The particle "si" is often used to indicate a more personal relationship to the action, e.g. –

The most <a href="productivity%20%28linguistics%29">productive</a> way to form adverbs is to derive them from the neuter singular form of the corresponding adjective—e.g. бързо (fast), силно (hard), странно (strange)—but adjectives ending in -ки use the masculine singular form (i.e. ending in -ки), instead—e.g. юнашки (heroically), мъжки (bravely, like a man), майсторски (skillfully). The same pattern is used to form adverbs from the (adjective-like) ordinal numerals, e.g. първо (firstly), второ (secondly), трето (thirdly), and in some cases from (adjective-like) cardinal numerals, e.g. двойно (twice as/double), тройно (three times as), петорно (five times as).

The remaining adverbs are formed in ways that are no longer productive in the language. A small number are original (not derived from other words), for example: тук (here), там (there), вътре (inside), вън (outside), много (very/much) etc. The rest are mostly fossilized case forms, such as:

Adverbs can sometimes be reduplicated to emphasize the qualitative or quantitative properties of actions, moods or relations as performed by the subject of the sentence: "бавно-бавно" ("rather slowly"), "едва-едва" ("with great difficulty"), "съвсем-съвсем" ("quite", "thoroughly").

Bulgarian employs <a href="clitic%20doubling">clitic doubling</a>, mostly for emphatic purposes. For example, the following constructions are common in colloquial Bulgarian:

The phenomenon is practically obligatory in the spoken language in the case of inversion signalling information structure (in writing, clitic doubling may be skipped in such instances, with a somewhat bookish effect):

Sometimes, the doubling signals syntactic relations, thus:

This is contrasted with:

In this case, clitic doubling can be a colloquial alternative of the more formal or bookish passive voice, which would be constructed as follows:

Clitic doubling is also fully obligatory, both in the spoken and in the written norm, in clauses including several special expressions that use the short accusative and dative pronouns such as играе ми се (I feel like playing), студено ми е (I am cold), and боли ме ръката (my arm hurts):

Except the above examples, clitic doubling is considered inappropriate in a formal context. Bulgarian grammars usually do not treat this phenomenon extensively.

Questions in Bulgarian which do not use a question word (such as who? what? etc.) are formed with the particle ли after the verb; a subject is not necessary, as the verbal conjugation suggests who is performing the action:

While the particle "ли" generally goes after the verb, it can go after a noun or adjective if a contrast is needed:
A verb is not always necessary, e.g. when presenting a choice:

Rhetorical questions can be formed by adding ли to a question word, thus forming a "double interrogative" –
The same construction +не ('no') is an emphasised positive –

Съм

The verb съм – 'to be' is also used as an <a href="auxiliary%20verb">auxiliary</a> for forming the <a href="perfect%20%28grammar%29">perfect</a>, the <a href="grammatical%20voice">passive</a> and the <a href="conditional%20mood">conditional</a>:

Two alternate forms of съм exist:

Ще

The impersonal verb ще (lit. 'it wants') is used to for forming the (positive) future tense:
The negative future is formed with the invariable construction няма да (see няма below):
The past tense of this verb – щях is conjugated to form the past conditional ('would have' – again, with да, since it is "<a href="irrealis">irrealis</a>"):

Имам and нямам

The verbs имам ('to have') and нямам ('to not have'):

Diminutive
Usually done by adding -че, -це or -(ч)ка. The first two of these change the gender to the neuter:

Affectionate Form

Sometimes <a href="proper%20noun">proper noun</a>s and words referring to friends or family members can have a diminutive ending added to show affection. These constructions are all referred to as ""na galeno"" (lit. "caressing" form):
Such words can be used "both" from parent to child, and vice versa, as can:

Personal names are shortened:

There is an interesting trend (which is comparatively modern, although it might well have deeper, dormant roots) where the feminine ending "-ka" and the definite suffix "-ta" ("the") are added to male names – note that this is affectionate and not at all insulting (in fact, the endings are not even really considered as being "feminine"):

The female equivalent would be to add the neuter ending "-to" to the diminutive form:

Augmentative

This is to present words to sound larger – usually by adding "-shte":
Some words only exist in an augmentative form – e.g.

"But"

In Bulgarian, there are several conjunctions all translating into English as "but", which are all used in distinct situations. They are но (no), ама (amà), а (a), ами (amì)", and ала (alà)" (and "обаче (obache)" – "however", identical in use to "но").

While there is some overlapping between their uses, in many cases they are specific. For example, ami is used for a choice – "ne tova, ami onova" – "not this one, but that one" (comp. Spanish "sino"), while ama is often used to provide extra information or an opinion – "kazah go, ama sgreshih" – "I said it, but I was wrong". Meanwhile, a provides contrast between two situations, and in some sentences can even be translated as "although", "while" or even "and" – "az rabotya, a toy blee" – "I'm working, and he's daydreaming".

Very often, different words can be used to alter the emphasis of a sentence – e.g. while ""pusha, no ne tryabva"" and ""pusha, a ne tryabva"" both mean "I smoke, but I shouldn't", the first sounds more like a statement of fact ("...but I mustn't"), while the second feels more like a "judgement" ("...but I oughtn't"). Similarly, "az ne iskam, ama toy iska" and "az ne iskam, a toy iska" both mean "I don't want to, but he does", however the first emphasises the fact that "he" wants to, while the second emphasises the "wanting" rather than the person.

"Ala" is interesting in that, while it feels archaic, it is often used in poetry and frequently in children's stories, since it has quite a moral/ominous feel to it.

Some common expressions use these words, and some can be used alone as interjections:

Bulgarian has several abstract particles which are used to strengthen a statement. These have no precise translation in English. The particles are strictly informal and can even be considered rude by some people and in some situations. They are mostly used at the end of questions or instructions.

Modal Particles

These are "tagged" on to the beginning or end of a sentence to express the mood of the speaker in relation to the situation. They are mostly <a href="interrogative">interrogative</a> or slightly <a href="imperative%20mood">imperative</a> in nature. There is no change in the grammatical mood when these are used (although they may be expressed through different grammatical moods in other languages).

These express intent or desire, perhaps even pleading. They can be seen as a sort of <a href="cohortative%20mood">cohortative</a> side to the language. (Since they can be used by themselves, they could even be considered as verbs in their own right.) They are also highly informal.

These particles can be combined with the vocative particles for greater effect, e.g. "ya da vidya, be" (let me see), or even exclusively in combinations with them, with no other elements, e.g. "hayde, de!" (come on!); "nedey, de!" (I told you not to!).

Bulgarian has several pronouns of quality which have no direct parallels in English – "kakav" (what sort of); "takuv" (this sort of); "onakuv" (that sort of – colloq.); "nyakakav" (some sort of); "nikakav" (no sort of); "vsyakakav" (every sort of); and the relative pronoun "kakavto" (the sort of...that...). The adjective "ednakuv" ("the same") derives from the same radical.

Example phrases include:

An interesting phenomenon is that these can be strung along one after another in quite long constructions, e.g.

An extreme (colloquial) sentence, with almost no "physical" meaning in it whatsoever – yet which "does" have perfect meaning to the Bulgarian ear – would be :
—Note: the subject of the sentence is simply the pronoun "taya" (lit. "this one here"; colloq. "she").

Another interesting phenomenon that is observed in colloquial speech is the use of "takova" (neuter of "takyv") not only as a substitute for an adjective, but also as a substitute for a verb. In that case the base form "takova" is used as the third person singular int the present indicative and all other forms are formed by analogy to other verbs in the language. Sometimes the "verb" may even acquire a derivational prefix that changes its meaning. Examples:
Another use of "takova" in colloquial speech is the word "takovata", which can be used as a substitution for a noun, but also, if the speaker doesn't remember or is not sure how to say something, they might say "takovata" and then pause to think about it:
Similar "meaningless" expressions are extremely common in spoken Bulgarian, especially when the speaker is finding it difficult to describe something.

Bulgarian has a rich set of inflectional and derivational processes. In the simplest terms, this can be seen in the way that most nouns and verbs are formed – namely by adding prefixes and suffixes to a rather limited number of roots, which creates almost a dozen new words, along with a couple of dozen derivatives thereof. Here are some examples using the root word "klyuch" (ключ) "key/switch":

Nouns:
Adjectives:
Verbs:
An extreme example using this root might be:

Adjectives can also take up to three endings that are added to the masculine root, for example:

Verbs can take several prefixes, thus expressing increasingly complex ideas. For example, the "bol–" root, which has to do with ailments ("bol-ka" – pain; "bol-est" – illness; "bol-i" – it hurts, etc.), can be used to express various different stages of falling ill:

Similarly, the root kri–, referring to hiding/discovery:


Most of the vocabulary of modern Bulgarian consists of derivations of some 2,000 words inherited from proto-Slavic through the mediation of Old and Middle Bulgarian. Thus, the native lexical terms in Bulgarian account for 70% to 75% of the lexicon.

The remaining 25% to 30% are loanwords from a number of languages, as well as derivations of such words. In ancient times, Bulgarian adopted words of <a href="Thracian%20language">Thracian</a> and <a href="Bulgar%20language">Bulgar</a> origin, as Bulgaria was inhabited by Thracian tribes, contributing to the ethnogenesis of the Bulgarian people (along with Slavs and <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a>), and the Bulgars settled in the plains south of the Danube. The languages which have contributed most to Bulgarian are <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> and <a href="English%20language">English</a>. Also <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> are the source of many words, used mostly in international terminology. Many Latin terms entered the language through Romanian, Aromanian, and Megleno-Romanian during Bulgarian Empires (present-day Bulgaria was part of Roman Empire), loanwords of Greek origin in Bulgarian are a product of the influence of the liturgical language of the Orthodox Church. Many of the numerous loanwords from another Turkic language, <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> (and, via Turkish, from <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> and <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>) which were adopted into Bulgarian during the long period of <a href="Ottoman%20empire">Ottoman</a> rule, have been replaced with native terms. In addition, both specialized (usually coming from the field of <a href="science">science</a>) and commonplace <a href="English%20language">English</a> words (notably abstract, commodity/service-related or technical terms) have also penetrated Bulgarian since the second half of the 20th century, especially since 1989. A noteworthy portion of this English-derived terminology has attained some unique features in the process of its introduction to native speakers, and this has resulted in peculiar derivations that set the newly formed loanwords apart from the original words (mainly in pronunciation), although many loanwords are completely identical to the source words. A growing number of international neologisms are also being widely adopted, causing controversy between younger generations who, in general, are raised in the era of digital <a href="globalization">globalization</a>, and the older, more conservative educated <a href="Linguistic%20purism">purists</a>.

Some very frequent expressions have been borrowed from other languages. Most of them are somewhat informal.

(In the above two examples, the formal expression uses a plural verb but a singular pronoun, which allows speakers to distinguish the two grammatical forms.)

Bipyramid

An "n"-gonal bipyramid or dipyramid is a <a href="polyhedron">polyhedron</a> formed by joining an "n"-gonal <a href="Pyramid%20%28geometry%29">pyramid</a> and its <a href="mirror%20image">mirror image</a> base-to-base. An "n"-gonal bipyramid has 2"n" <a href="triangle">triangle</a> faces, 3"n" edges, and 2 + "n" vertices.

The referenced "n"-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.

A right bipyramid has two points above and below the <a href="centroid">centroid</a> of its base. Nonright bipyramids are called oblique bipyramids. A regular bipyramid has a <a href="regular%20polygon">regular polygon</a> internal face and is usually implied to be a "right bipyramid". A right bipyramid can be represented as for internal polygon P, and a regular "n"-bipyramid 

A concave bipyramid has a concave interior polygon.

The <a href="face-transitive">face-transitive</a> regular bipyramids are the <a href="dual%20polyhedra">dual polyhedra</a> of the <a href="Prism%20%28geometry%29">uniform prisms</a> and will generally have <a href="isosceles%20triangle">isosceles triangle</a> faces.

A bipyramid can be <a href="Perspective%20projection">projected</a> on a sphere or <a href="globe">globe</a> as "n" equally spaced lines of <a href="longitude">longitude</a> going from <a href="Geographical%20pole">pole</a> to pole, and <a href="Bisection">bisected</a> by a line around the <a href="equator">equator</a>.

Bipyramid <a href="face%20%28geometry%29">face</a>s, projected as <a href="spherical%20triangle">spherical triangle</a>s, represent the fundamental domains in the <a href="List%20of%20spherical%20symmetry%20groups%23Dihedral">dihedral symmetry</a> D.

The <a href="volume">volume</a> of a bipyramid is "V" ="Bh" where "B" is the area of the base and "h" the height from the base to the apex. This works for any location of the apex, provided that "h" is measured as the <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> distance from the <a href="plane%20%28geometry%29">plane</a> which contains the base.

The volume of a bipyramid whose base is a regular "n"-sided <a href="polygon">polygon</a> with side length "s" and whose height is "h" is therefore:

Only three kinds of bipyramids can have all edges of the same length (which implies that all faces are <a href="equilateral%20triangle">equilateral triangle</a>s, and thus the bipyramid is a <a href="deltahedron">deltahedron</a>): the <a href="Triangular%20dipyramid">triangular</a>, <a href="tetragonal">tetragonal</a>, and <a href="Pentagonal%20dipyramid">pentagonal</a> bipyramids. The tetragonal bipyramid with identical edges, or <a href="regular%20octahedron">regular octahedron</a>, counts among the <a href="Platonic%20solid">Platonic solid</a>s, while the triangular and pentagonal bipyramids with identical edges count among the <a href="Johnson%20solid">Johnson solid</a>s (J and J).
If the base is regular and the line through the <a href="Apex%20%28geometry%29">apexes</a> intersects the base at its center, the <a href="List%20of%20spherical%20symmetry%20groups">symmetry group</a> of the "n"-gonal bipyramid has <a href="Dihedral%20symmetry%20in%20three%20dimensions">dihedral symmetry</a> D of order 4"n", except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger <a href="octahedral%20symmetry">octahedral symmetry</a> group O of order 48, which has three versions of D as subgroups. The <a href="Point%20groups%20in%20three%20dimensions%23Rotation%20groups">rotation group</a> is D of order 2"n", except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group O of order 24, which has three versions of D as subgroups.

The digonal faces of a <a href="Spherical%20polyhedron">spherical</a> 2"n"-bipyramid represents the fundamental domains of <a href="dihedral%20symmetry%20in%20three%20dimensions">dihedral symmetry in three dimensions</a>: D, ["n",2], (*"n"22), order 4"n". The reflection domains can be shown as alternately colored triangles as mirror images.

A scalenohedron is topologically identical to a 2"n"-bipyramid, but contains congruent <a href="scalene%20triangle">scalene triangle</a>s.

There are two types. In one type the 2"n" vertices around the center alternate in rings above and below the center. In the other type, the 2"n" vertices are on the same plane, but alternate in two radii.

The first has 2-fold rotation axes mid-edge around the sides, reflection planes through the vertices, and n-fold rotation symmetry on its axis, representing symmetry D, [2,2"n"], (2*"n"), order 2"n". In <a href="crystallography">crystallography</a>, 8-sided and 12-sided scalenohedra exist. All of these forms are <a href="isohedron">isohedra</a>.

The second has symmetry D, [2,"n"], (*"nn"2), order 2"n".

The smallest scalenohedron has 8 faces and is topologically identical to the regular octahedron. The second type is a "rhombic bipyramid". The first type has 6 vertices can be represented as (0,0,±1), (±1,0,"z"), (0,±1,−"z"), where "z" is a parameter between 0 and 1, creating a regular octahedron at "z" = 0, and becoming a <a href="disphenoid">disphenoid</a> with merged coplanar faces at "z" = 1. For "z" > 1, it becomes concave.

Self-intersecting bipyramids exist with a <a href="star%20polygon">star polygon</a> central figure, defined by triangular faces connecting each polygon edge to these two points. A {p/q} bipyramid has <a href="Coxeter%20diagram">Coxeter diagram</a> .
<a href="isohedron">isohedral</a> even-sided stars can also be made with <a href="regular%20skew%20polygon">zig-zag offplane</a> vertices, in-out <a href="isotoxal%20polygon">isotoxal</a> forms, or both, like this {8/3} form:

The <a href="Dual%20polyhedron%23Dual%20polytopes%20and%20tessellations">dual</a> of the <a href="Rectification%20%28geometry%29">rectification</a> of each <a href="convex%20regular%204-polytope">convex regular 4-polytope</a>s is a <a href="cell-transitive">cell-transitive</a> <a href="4-polytope">4-polytope</a> with bipyramidal cells. In the following, the apex vertex of the bipyramid is A and an equator vertex is E. The distance between adjacent vertices on the equator EE = 1, the apex to equator edge is AE and the distance between the apices is AA. The bipyramid 4-polytope will have "V" vertices where the apices of "N" bipyramids meet. It will have "V" vertices where the type E vertices of "N" bipyramids meet. "N" bipyramids meet along each type AE edge. "N" bipyramids meet along each type EE edge. "C" is the cosine of the dihedral angle along an AE edge. "C" is the cosine of the <a href="dihedral%20angle">dihedral angle</a> along an EE edge. As cells must fit around an edge, 

In general, a "bipyramid" can be seen as an "n"-<a href="polytope">polytope</a> constructed with a ("n" − 1)-polytope in a <a href="hyperplane">hyperplane</a> with two points in opposite directions, equal distance perpendicular from the hyperplane. If the ("n" − 1)-polytope is a regular polytope, it will have identical <a href="Pyramid%20%28geometry%29">pyramids</a> <a href="Facet%20%28geometry%29">facets</a>. An example is the <a href="16-cell">16-cell</a>, which is an octahedral bipyramid, and more generally an "n"-<a href="orthoplex%23Higher%20dimensions">orthoplex</a> is an ("n" − 1)-orthoplex bypyramid.

Beast of Bodmin Moor

The Beast of Bodmin Moor, also known as the Beast of Bodmin () is a <a href="Phantom%20cat">phantom wild cat</a> purported to live in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, England. <a href="Bodmin%20Moor">Bodmin Moor</a> became a centre of purported sightings after 1978, with occasional reports of mutilated slain <a href="livestock">livestock</a>; the alleged <a href="Leopard">panther</a>-like cats of the same region came to be popularly known as the Beast of Bodmin Moor.

In general, scientists reject such claims because of the improbably large numbers necessary to maintain a breeding population and because climate and food supply issues would make such purported creatures' survival in reported habitats unlikely.

A long-held hypothesis suggests the possibility that <a href="alien%20big%20cats">alien big cats</a> at large in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> could have been imported as part of private collections or zoos, later escaped or set free. An escaped big cat would not be reported to the authorities due to the illegality of owning and importing the animals. It has been claimed by that animal trainer <a href="Mary%20Chipperfield">Mary Chipperfield</a> released three <a href="puma%20%28genus%29">puma</a>s into the wild following the closure of her <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> zoo in 1978, and that subsequent sightings of the animals gave rise to rumors of the Beast.

The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%2C%20Fisheries%20and%20Food%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a> conducted an official investigation in 1995. The study found that there was "no verifiable evidence" of exotic felines loose in Britain, and that the mauled farm animals could have been attacked by common indigenous species. The report stated that, "No verifiable evidence for the presence of a 'big cat' was found... There is no significant threat to livestock from a 'big cat' in Bodmin Moor."

Less than a week after the government report, a boy was walking by the <a href="River%20Fowey">River Fowey</a> when he discovered a large cat skull. Measuring about long by wide, the skull was lacking its lower jaw but possessed two sharp, prominent canines that suggested that it might have been a leopard. The story hit the national press at about the same time of the official denial of alien big cat evidence on Bodmin Moor.

The skull was sent to the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="London">London</a> for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain and that the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. The back of the skull was cleanly cut off in a way that is commonly used to mount the head on a rug. There was an egg case inside the skull that had been laid by a tropical cockroach that could not possibly be found in Britain. There were also cut marks on the skull indicating the flesh had been scraped off with a knife, and the skull had begun to decompose only after a recent immersion in water.

Brown University

Brown University is a <a href="Private%20university">private</a> <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> <a href="Doctoral%20university">research university</a> in <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Founded in 1764 as the <a href="College%20in%20the%20English%20Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a>, Brown is the <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20colleges">seventh-oldest institution</a> of <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a> in the United States and one of the nine <a href="colonial%20colleges">colonial colleges</a> chartered before the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>.

At its foundation, Brown was the first college in the United States to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation. Its <a href="engineering">engineering</a> program was established in 1847 and was the first in the Ivy League. It was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding master and doctoral studies in 1887. Brown's <a href="Brown%20University%23The%20New%20Curriculum">New Curriculum</a> is sometimes referred to in education theory as the Brown Curriculum and was adopted by faculty vote in 1969 after a period of student lobbying. The New Curriculum eliminated mandatory "general education" distribution requirements, made students "the architects of their own syllabus" and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory or unrecorded no-credit. In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution <a href="Pembroke%20College%20%28Brown%20University%29">Pembroke College</a> was fully merged into the university and Pembroke Campus now includes dormitories and classrooms used by all of Brown.

Undergraduate admissions is very selective, with an acceptance rate of 8.3 percent for the class of 2021. The University comprises the <a href="The%20College%20of%20Brown%20University">College</a>, the <a href="Graduate%20School%20of%20Brown%20University">Graduate School</a>, <a href="Alpert%20Medical%20School">Alpert Medical School</a>, the <a href="Brown%20University%20School%20of%20Engineering">School of Engineering</a>, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies (which includes the <a href="IE%20Business%20School">IE</a> Brown Executive MBA program). Brown's international programs are organized through the <a href="Watson%20Institute%20for%20International%20and%20Public%20Affairs">Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs</a> and the university is academically affiliated with the <a href="Marine%20Biological%20Laboratory">Marine Biological Laboratory</a> and the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20School%20of%20Design">Rhode Island School of Design</a>. The <a href="Brown%20University%23Brown/RISD%20Dual%20Degree%20Program">Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program</a>, offered in conjunction with the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20School%20of%20Design">Rhode Island School of Design</a>, is a five-year course that awards degrees from both institutions.

Brown's main campus is located in the <a href="College%20Hill%20Historic%20District%20%28Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island%29">College Hill Historic District</a> in the city of Providence, the third largest city in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. The University's neighborhood is a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, on the western edge of the campus, contains "one of the finest cohesive collections of restored seventeenth- and eighteenth-century architecture in the United States".

Brown's <a href="List%20of%20Brown%20University%20people">faculty and alumni</a> include eight <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> laureates, five <a href="National%20Humanities%20Medal">National Humanities Medal</a>ists and ten <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Science">National Medal of Science</a> laureates. <a href="List%20of%20Brown%20University%20people">Other notable alumni</a> include eight billionaire graduates, a <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice</a>, four <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">U.S. Secretaries of State</a> and other Cabinet officials, 54 members of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>, 55 <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholars</a>, 52 <a href="Gates%20Cambridge%20Scholarships">Gates Cambridge Scholars</a> 48 <a href="Marshall%20Scholars">Marshall Scholars</a>, 14 <a href="MacArthur%20Fellows%20Program">MacArthur Genius</a> Fellows, 19 <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> winners and members of royal families, as well as leaders and founders of major companies.

The origin of Brown University can be dated to 1761, when three residents of <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a> drafted a petition to the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> of the colony:

Your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography & History, & such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired. That for this End ... it will be necessary ... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.

The three petitioners were <a href="Ezra%20Stiles">Ezra Stiles</a>, pastor of Newport's <a href="Clarke%20Street%20Meeting%20House">Second Congregational Church</a> and future president of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a>; <a href="William%20Ellery">William Ellery, Jr.</a>, future <a href="Signing%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">signer</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>; and <a href="Josias%20Lyndon">Josias Lyndon</a>, future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery were co-authors of the Charter of the College two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, "This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University."

There is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college in 1762. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:

The week before last I sent you the Copy of Yale College Charter... Should you make any Progress in the Affair of a Colledge, I should be glad to hear of it; I heartily wish you Success therein.

The Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches also had an eye on Rhode Island, home of the mother church of their denomination: the <a href="First%20Baptist%20Church%20in%20America">First Baptist Church in America</a>, founded in Providence in 1638 by <a href="Roger%20Williams%20%28theologian%29">Roger Williams</a>. The Baptists were as yet unrepresented among colonial colleges; the <a href="Congregationalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Congregationalists</a> had <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a> and <a href="Yale">Yale</a>, the <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterians</a> had the College of New Jersey (later <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a>), and the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Episcopalians</a> had the <a href="College%20of%20William%20and%20Mary">College of William and Mary</a> and King's College (later <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia</a>). Isaac Backus was the historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural Trustee of Brown, writing in 1784. He described the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:

The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. <a href="James%20Manning%20%28minister%29">James Manning</a>, who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.

Manning arrived at <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport</a> in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would under-represent the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Assembly on March 3, 1764.

In September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the College Corporation was held at Newport. Governor <a href="Stephen%20Hopkins%20%28politician%29">Stephen Hopkins</a> was chosen chancellor, former and future governor <a href="Samuel%20Ward%20%28American%20statesman%29">Samuel Ward</a> was vice chancellor, <a href="John%20Tillinghast">John Tillinghast</a> treasurer, and <a href="Thomas%20Eyres">Thomas Eyres</a> secretary. The Charter stipulated that the Board of Trustees be composed of 22 Baptists, five <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quakers</a>, five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists—including the College president—"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations."

The Charter was not the grant of <a href="King%20George%20III">King George III</a>, as is sometimes supposed, but rather an Act of the colonial General Assembly. In two particulars, the Charter may be said to be a uniquely progressive document. First, other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's Charter asserted, "Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction." Second, according to Brown University historian Walter Bronson, "the instrument governing Brown University recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other the principle of denominational cooperation." The oft-repeated statement is inaccurate that Brown's Charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership; other college charters were also liberal in that particular.

<a href="James%20Manning%20%28minister%29">James Manning</a> was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765 and served until 1791. In 1770, the College moved from <a href="Warren%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Warren, Rhode Island</a> to the crest of <a href="College%20Hill%2C%20Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">College Hill</a> overlooking Providence. <a href="Solomon%20Drowne">Solomon Drowne</a>, a freshman in the class of 1773, wrote in his diary on March 26, 1770:

This day the Committee for settling the spot for the College, met at the New-Brick School House, when it was determined it should be set on ye Hill opposite Mr. John Jenkes; up the Presbyterian Lane.

Presbyterian Lane is the present College Street. The eight-acre site had been purchased in two parcels by the Corporation for £219, mainly from <a href="Moses%20Brown">Moses Brown</a> and <a href="John%20Brown%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">John Brown</a>, the parcels having "formed a part of the original home lots of their ancestor, <a href="Chad%20Brown%20%28minister%29">Chad Brown</a>, and of George Rickard, who bought them from the Indians." <a href="University%20Hall%20%28Brown%20University%29">University Hall</a> was known as "The College Edifice" until 1823; it was modelled on <a href="Nassau%20Hall">Nassau Hall</a> at the College of New Jersey. Its construction was managed by the firm of Nicholas Brown and Company, which spent £2,844 in the first year building the College Edifice and the adjacent President's House.

<a href="Nicholas%20Brown%20%28Brown%20University%29">Nicholas Brown</a>, his son <a href="Nicholas%20Brown%2C%20Jr.">Nicholas Brown, Jr.</a> (class of 1786), <a href="John%20Brown%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">John Brown</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Brown%20%28astronomer%29">Joseph Brown</a>, and <a href="Moses%20Brown">Moses Brown</a> were all instrumental in moving the College to Providence and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural philosophy at the College; John served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Junior succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to 1825.

On September 8, 1803, the Corporation voted, "That the donation of $5000 Dollars, if made to this College within one Year from the late Commencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College." That appeal was answered by College treasurer Nicholas Brown Junior in a letter dated September 6, 1804, and the Corporation honored its promise. "In gratitude to Mr. Brown, the Corporation at the same meeting voted, 'That this College be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown University'." Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown, Jr. totaled nearly $160,000, an enormous sum for that period, and included the buildings Hope College (1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834-35).

It is sometimes erroneously supposed that Brown University was named after John Brown, whose commercial activity included the transportation of African slaves. In fact, Brown University was named for Nicholas Brown, Jr.—philanthropist, founder of the <a href="Providence%20Athenaeum">Providence Athenaeum</a>, co-founder of <a href="Butler%20Hospital">Butler Hospital</a>, and an <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a>. Nicholas Brown, Jr. became a financier of the movement under the guidance of his uncle <a href="Moses%20Brown">Moses Brown</a>, one of the leading abolitionists of his day.

The College library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping in the fall of 1776, with British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay. On December 7, 1776, six thousand British and Hessian troops sailed into Newport harbor under the command of Sir Peter Parker. College president Manning said in a letter written after the war:

The royal Army landed on Rhode Island & took possession of the same: This brought their Camp in plain View from the College with the naked Eye; upon which the Country flew to Arms & marched for Providence, there, unprovided with Barracks they marched into the College & dispossessed the Students, about 40 in Number.

"In the claim for damages presented by the Corporation to the United States government," says the University historian, "it is stated that the American troops used it for barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and that the French troops used it for a hospital from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782." The French troops were those of the <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Donatien%20de%20Vimeur%2C%20comte%20de%20Rochambeau">Comte de Rochambeau</a>.

In 1850, Brown President <a href="Francis%20Wayland">Francis Wayland</a> wrote: "The various courses should be so arranged that, insofar as practicable, every student might study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose." The New Curriculum was adopted in 1969; it is a milestone in the University's history and is seen as the realization of Wayland's vision.

The <a href="curriculum">curriculum</a> was the result of a paper written by <a href="Ira%20Magaziner">Ira Magaziner</a> and Elliot Maxwell entitled "Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University." The paper came out of a year-long Group Independent Study Project (GISP) involving 80 students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially <a href="San%20Francisco%20State%20University">San Francisco State College</a>, and sought ways to "put students at the center of their education" and "teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts."

The paper made concrete proposals for the new curriculum, including <a href="interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> freshman-year courses that would introduce "modes of thought," with instruction from faculty brought together from different disciplines. The aim was to transform the traditional survey course—often experienced passively by first-year students—into a more engaging process, an investigation of the intellectual and philosophical connections between disciplines. A grading option of Satisfactory/No Credit was introduced to encourage students to try courses outside their grade-point comfort zone. In practice, this grading innovation of the New Curriculum has been its most successful component, sometimes misunderstood and mischaracterized but responsible for uncounted career-changing decisions in the decades since its adoption—studio art swapped for neuroscience, biology swapped for anthropology, mathematics swapped for playwriting (and <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>s).
University president Ray Heffner appointed the Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy in the spring of 1969, following student rallies in support of reform, and gave them the task of developing specific reforms. The resulting report was called the Maeder Report after its committee chairman and was presented to the faculty, which voted the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its key features included:

The Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements are still in place. In 2006, the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was broached by persons concerned about grade inflation. The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.

Brown University's coat of arms is a white field divided into four sectors by a red cross; within each sector is an open book. Above the shield is a crest consisting of the upper half of a <a href="sun%20in%20splendor">sun in splendor</a> among the clouds atop a red and white <a href="torse">torse</a>.
The sun and clouds represent "learning piercing the clouds of ignorance." The cross is believed to be a <a href="Saint%20George%27s%20Cross">Saint George's Cross</a>, and the open books represent learning.

Brown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the <a href="Jewelry%20District%20%28Providence%29">Jewelry District</a>. The College Hill campus was built contemporarily with the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century precincts that surround it, so that University buildings blend with the architectural fabric of the city. The only indicator of "campus" is a brick and wrought-iron fence on Prospect, George, and Waterman streets, enclosing the College Green and Front Green. The character of Brown's urban campus is then European organic rather than American landscaped.

The main campus, comprising 235 buildings and , is on College Hill in Providence's <a href="East%20Side%2C%20Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">East Side</a>. It is reached from downtown principally by three extremely steep streets—College, Waterman, and <a href="Angell%20Street">Angell</a>—which run through the Benefit Street historic district and the campus of the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20School%20of%20Design">Rhode Island School of Design</a>. College Street, culminating with Van Wickle Gates at the top of the hill, is especially beautiful, and is the setting for the Convocation and Commencement processions.

Van Wickle Gates

The Van Wickle Gates, dedicated on June 18, 1901, have a pair of smaller side gates that are open year-round, and a large central gate that is opened two days a year for Convocation and Commencement. At Convocation the gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students. At Commencement the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates. A Brown superstition is that students who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backwards is said to cancel the hex. Members of the <a href="Brown%20University%20Band">Brown University Band</a> famously flout the superstition by walking through the gate three times too many, as they annually play their role in the Commencement parade.
The core green spaces of the main campus are the Front (or "Quiet") Green, the College (or "Main") Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (until 2012 called Lincoln Field). The old buildings on these three greens are the most photographed.

Adjacent to this older campus are, to the south, academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles; to the east, Sciences Park occupying two city blocks; to the north, connected to Simmons Quadrangle by The Walk, academic and residential precincts, including the life sciences complex and the Pembroke Campus; and to the west, on the slope of College Hill, academic buildings, including List Art Center and the Hay and Rockefeller libraries. Also on the slope of College Hill, contiguous with Brown, is the campus of the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20School%20of%20Design">Rhode Island School of Design</a>.
John Hay Library

The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus. It was opened in 1910 and named for <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a> (class of 1858, private secretary to <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and Secretary of State under two Presidents) at the request of his friend <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>, who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of the building. It is now the repository of the University's archives, rare books and manuscripts, and special collections. Noteworthy among the latter are the <a href="Anne%20S.%20K.%20Brown%20Military%20Collection">Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection</a> (described as "the foremost American collection of material devoted to the history and iconography of soldiers and soldiering"), the Harris Collection of American Poetry and Plays (described as "the largest and most comprehensive collection of its kind in any research library"), the Lownes Collection of the History of Science (described as "one of the three most important private collections of books of science in America"), and (for popularity of requests) the papers of <a href="H.P.%20Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>. The Hay Library is home to one of the broadest collections of <a href="Incunable">incunabula</a> (15th-century printed books) in the Americas, as well as such rarities as the manuscript of <a href="George%20Orwell">Orwell</a>'s "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>" and a Shakespeare <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a>. There are also three books <a href="Anthropodermic%20bibliopegy">bound in human skin</a>.
John Carter Brown Library

The John Carter Brown Library, founded in 1846, is administered separately from the University, but has been located on the Main Green of the campus since 1904. It is generally regarded as the world's leading collection of primary historical sources pertaining to the Americas before 1825. It houses a very large percentage of the titles published before that date about the discovery, settlement, history, and natural history of the New World. The "JCB", as it is known, published the 29-volume "Bibliotheca Americana", a principal bibliography in the field. Typical of its noteworthy holdings is the best preserved of the eleven surviving copies of the <a href="Bay%20Psalm%20Book">Bay Psalm Book</a> the earliest extant book printed in British North America and the most expensive printed book in the world. There is also a very fine Shakespeare <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a>, added to the collection by John Carter Brown's widow (a Shakespeare enthusiast) on the grounds that it includes "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>", a play set in the New World. The JCB holdings comprise more than 50,000 early titles and about 16,000 modern books, as well as prints, manuscripts, maps, and other items in the library's specialty.

The exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, RI. The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology, and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.

The "Walk" connects Pembroke Campus to the main campus. It is a succession of green spaces extending from Ruth Simmons Quadrangle (Lincoln Field) in the south to the Pembroke College monument on Meeting Street in the north. It is bordered by departmental buildings and the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. A focal point of The Walk will be the <a href="Maya%20Lin">Maya Lin</a>-designed water-circulating topographical sculpture of Narragansett Bay, to be installed in 2014 next to the Institute for the Study of Environment and Society.

The <a href="Pembroke%20College%20in%20Brown%20University">Women's College in Brown University</a>, known as Pembroke College, was founded in October 1891. When it merged with Brown in 1971, the Pembroke Campus was absorbed into the Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is centered on a quadrangle that fronts on Meeting Street, where a garden and monument—with scale-model of the quadrangle in bronze—compose the formal entry to the campus. The Pembroke campus is among the most pleasing spaces at Brown, with noteworthy examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907, formerly Pembroke Gymnasium), and Metcalf Hall (1919); the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910); the quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947) and its terrace and garden. Pembroke Hall, originally a classroom building and library, now houses the Cogut Center for the Humanities.
East Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, was originally the site of <a href="Bryant%20University">Bryant University</a>. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to move to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown bought their Providence campus for $5 million. This expanded the Brown campus by and 26 buildings, included several historic houses, notably the Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850 (now Brown's Orwig Music Library), and the Robert Taft House, built 1895 (now King House). The area was named East Campus in 1971.

<a href="Thayer%20Street">Thayer Street</a> runs through Brown's main campus, north to south, and is College Hill's reduced-scale counterpart to <a href="Harvard%20Square">Harvard Square</a> or Berkeley's <a href="Telegraph%20Avenue">Telegraph Avenue</a>. Restaurants, cafes, bistros, tavernas, pubs, bookstores, second-hand shops, and the like abound. Tourists, people-watchers, buskers, and students from Providence's six colleges make the scene. Half a mile south of campus is Thayer Street's hipper cousin, <a href="Wickenden%20Street">Wickenden Street</a>. More picturesque and with older architecture, it features galleries, pubs, specialty shops, artist-supply stores, and a regionally famous coffee shop that doubles as a film set (for <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a> and others).

<a href="Brown%20Stadium">Brown Stadium</a>, built in 1925 and home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus. Marston Boathouse, the home of the crew teams, lies on the Blackstone/Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School is situated in the historic <a href="Jewelry%20District%20%28Providence%29">Jewelry District of Providence</a>, near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, <a href="Rhode%20Island%20Hospital">Rhode Island Hospital</a>, <a href="Women%20%26amp%3B%20Infants%20Hospital%20of%20Rhode%20Island">Women and Infants Hospital</a>, and Hasbro Children's Hospital. Other University research facilities in the Jewelry District include the Laboratories for Molecular Medicine.

Brown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building overlooking Memorial Park on the Providence Riverwalk. Brown also owns the <a href="Mount%20Hope%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">Mount Hope Grant</a> in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> and <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's War</a> site. Brown's <a href="Haffenreffer%20Museum%20of%20Anthropology">Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology</a> Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.

Brown's current president <a href="Christina%20Hull%20Paxson">Christina Hull Paxson</a> took office in 2012. She had previously been dean of the <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson%20School%20of%20Public%20and%20International%20Affairs">Woodrow Wilson School</a> at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> and a past-chair of Princeton's economics department. In 2014 and 2015, Paxson presided over the year-long celebration of the 250th anniversary of Brown's founding. Her immediate predecessor as president was Ruth J. Simmons, the first <a href="African%20American">African American</a> president of an Ivy League institution. Simmons will remain at Brown as a professor of Comparative Literature and Africana Studies.

Founded in 1764, the College is the oldest school of Brown University. About 6,400 undergraduate students are currently enrolled in the College, and 79 concentrations (majors) are offered. Completed concentrations of undergraduates by area are social sciences 42 percent, humanities 26 percent, life sciences 17 percent, and physical sciences 14 percent. The concentrations with the greatest number of students are Biology, History, and International Relations. Brown is one of the few schools in the United States with an undergraduate concentration (major) in <a href="Egyptology">Egyptology</a>. Undergraduates can also design an independent concentration if the existing programs do not align with their curricular focus.

35 percent of undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60 percent within 5 years, and 80 percent within 10 years. For the Class of 1998, 75 percent of all graduates have since enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program. The degrees acquired were doctoral 22 percent, master's 35 percent, medicine 28 percent, and law 14 percent.

The highest fields of employment for graduates of the College are business 36 percent, education 19 percent, health/medical 6 percent, arts 6 percent, government 6 percent, and communications/media 5 percent.

The language of the College Charter has been interpreted as discouraging the establishment professional schools. Brown and Princeton are the only Ivy League colleges with neither business school nor law school.

Brown's near neighbor on College Hill is the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20School%20of%20Design">Rhode Island School of Design</a> (RISD), America's top-ranked art college. Brown and RISD students can cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD that count towards a Brown degree. The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.

The Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 17 of the 512 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2015, an acceptance rate of 3.3 percent. It combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art at RISD with the entire spectrum of Brown's departmental offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown/RISD joint committee.

Admitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its "foundation course," and the second year in residence at Brown. Another year at each school ensues, with the fifth year spent according to the student's electives. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual "BRDD Exhibition" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the wider world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.

Brown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country. Since 2003 eight different Brown graduates have either won (four times) or been nominated for (six times) the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>—including winners <a href="Lynn%20Nottage">Lynn Nottage</a> '86 (twice—2009, 2017), <a href="Ayad%20Akhtar">Ayad Akhtar</a> '93, <a href="Nilo%20Cruz">Nilo Cruz</a> '94, and <a href="Quiara%20Alegr%C3%ADa%20Hudes">Quiara Alegría Hudes</a> '04; and nominees <a href="Sarah%20Ruhl">Sarah Ruhl</a> '97 (twice), <a href="Gina%20Gionfriddo">Gina Gionfriddo</a> '97 (twice), <a href="Stephen%20Karam">Stephen Karam</a> '02, and <a href="Jordan%20Harrison">Jordan Harrison</a> '03. In "American Theater" magazine's 2009 ranking of the most-produced American plays, Brown graduates occupied four of the top five places—Peter Nachtrieb '97, Rachel Sheinkin '89, Sarah Ruhl '97, and Stephen Karam '02.

The undergraduate concentration (major) encompasses programs in theatre history, performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy, acting, directing, dance, speech, and technical production. Applications for doctoral and master's degree programs are made through the University Graduate School. Master's degrees in acting and directing are pursued in conjunction with the Rep MFA program, which partners with one of the country's great regional theatres, <a href="Trinity%20Repertory%20Company">Trinity Repertory Company</a>, home of the last longstanding resident acting company in the country. Trinity Rep's present artistic director <a href="Curt%20Columbus">Curt Columbus</a> succeeded <a href="Oskar%20Eustis">Oskar Eustis</a> in 2006, when Eustis was chosen to lead New York's <a href="The%20Public%20Theater">Public Theater</a>.

The many performance spaces available to Brown students include the Chace and Dowling theaters at Trinity Rep; the McCormack Family, Lee Strasberg, Rites and Reason, Ashamu Dance, Stuart, and Leeds theatres in University departments; the Upstairs Space and Downstairs Space belonging to the wholly student-run <a href="Production%20Workshop">Production Workshop</a>; and Alumnae Hall, used by Brown University Gilbert & Sullivan and by <a href="Brown%20Opera%20Productions">Brown Opera Productions</a>. Production design courses utilize the John Street Studio of <a href="Eugene%20Lee%20%28designer%29">Eugene Lee</a>, three-time <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>-winner.

Writing at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, electronic writing, mixed media, and the undergraduate writing proficiency requirement—is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty that has long included nationally and internationally known authors. The undergraduate concentration (major) in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department, and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.

Alumni authors take their degrees across the spectrum of degree concentrations, but a gauge of the strength of writing at Brown is the number of major national writing prizes won. To note only winners since the year 2000: <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Fiction">Pulitzer Prize for Fiction</a>-winners <a href="Jeffrey%20Eugenides">Jeffrey Eugenides</a> '82 (2003) and <a href="Marilynne%20Robinson">Marilynne Robinson</a> '66 (2005); British <a href="Orange%20Prize">Orange Prize</a>-winners <a href="Marilynne%20Robinson">Marilynne Robinson</a> '66 (2009) and <a href="Madeline%20Miller">Madeline Miller</a> '00 (2012); <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</a>-winners <a href="Nilo%20Cruz">Nilo Cruz</a> '94 (2003), <a href="Lynn%20Nottage">Lynn Nottage</a> '86 (twice, 2009, 2017), <a href="Quiara%20Alegr%C3%ADa%20Hudes">Quiara Alegría Hudes</a> '04 (2012), and <a href="Ayad%20Akhtar">Ayad Akhtar</a> '93 (2013); <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Biography%20or%20Autobiography">Pulitzer Prize for Biography</a>-winner <a href="David%20Kertzer">David Kertzer</a> '69 (2015); <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize for Journalism</a>-winners <a href="James%20Risen">James Risen</a> '77 (twice, 2002, 2006), <a href="Mark%20Maremont">Mark Maremont</a> '80 (twice, 2003, 2007), <a href="Gareth%20Cook">Gareth Cook</a> '91 (2005), Peter Kovacs '77 (2006), Stephanie Grace '86 (2006), Mary Swerczek '98 (2006), Jane B.

Teaching of computer science began at Brown in 1956 when an IBM machine was installed and computing courses were offered through the departments of Economics and Applied Mathematics. In January 1958 an IBM650 was added, the only one of its type between Hartford and Boston. In 1960 Brown's first computer building, designed by <a href="Philip%20Johnson">Philip Johnson</a>, was opened on George Street and an IBM7070 computer installed the next year. It was given full Departmental status in 1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflops standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.
The <a href="Hypertext%20Editing%20System">Hypertext Editing System</a>s, <a href="Hypertext%20Editing%20System">HES</a> and <a href="FRESS">FRESS</a>, were invented in the 1960s at Brown by <a href="Andries%20van%20Dam">Andries van Dam</a>, <a href="Ted%20Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Wallace">Bob Wallace</a>, with Nelson coining the word "<a href="hypertext">hypertext</a>". Van Dam's students were instrumental in the origin of the <a href="XML">XML</a>, <a href="XSLT">XSLT</a>, and related Web standards. Brown alumni who have distinguished themselves in the computer sciences and industry are listed in the Notable people section, below. They include a principal architect of the <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Classic Mac OS</a>, a principal architect of the <a href="Intel%2080386">Intel 80386</a> microprocessor line, the <a href="Windows%2095">Microsoft Windows 95</a> project chief, a CEO of <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a>, the current head of the <a href="MIT%20Computer%20Science%20and%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Laboratory">MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the inaugural chair of the <a href="Computing%20Community%20Consortium">Computing Community Consortium</a>, and design chiefs at <a href="Pixar">Pixar</a> and <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a>, protegees of graphics guru <a href="Andries%20van%20Dam">Andries van Dam</a>. The character "Andy" in the animated film "Toy Story" is taken to be an homage to Van Dam from his students employed at Pixar. Van Dam denies this, but a copy of his book ("Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice") appears on Andy's bookshelf in the film. Brown computer science graduate and "<a href="Heroes%20%28TV%20series%29">Heroes</a>" actor <a href="Masi%20Oka">Masi Oka</a> '97, was an animator at <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a>.

The department today is home to <a href="Cave%20Automatic%20Virtual%20Environment">The CAVE</a>. This project is a <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> room used for everything from three-dimensional drawing classes to tours of the <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a> for medical students. In 2000 students from Brown's Technology House converted the south face of the Sciences Library into a <a href="Tetris">Tetris</a> game, the first high-rise-building Tetris ever attempted. Code named La Bastille, the game used a <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> running <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, a radio-frequency video game controller, eleven circuit boards, a 12-story data network, and over 10,000 Christmas lights.

The <a href="Joukowsky%20Institute%20for%20Archaeology%20and%20the%20Ancient%20World">Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World</a> pursues fieldwork and excavations, regional surveys, and academic study of the archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and Western Asia from the Levant to the Caucasus. The Institute has a very active fieldwork profile, with faculty-led excavations and regional surveys presently in Petra, Jordan, in West-Central Turkey, at Abydos in Egypt, and in Sudan, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Montserrat in the West Indies, and Providence, Rhode Island.

The Institute's faculty includes cross-appointments from the departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics, Anthropology, and History of Art and Architecture. Faculty research and publication areas include Greek and Roman art and architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean Bronze Age, and the archaeology of the Caucasus. The Institute offers visiting teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships which have, in recent years, included Near Eastern Archaeology and Art, Classical Archaeology and Art, Islamic Archaeology and Art, and Archaeology and Media Studies.

Egyptology and Assyriology

Facing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the Department of Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's renowned departments of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United States. The curricular focus is on three principal areas: Egyptology (the study of the ancient languages, history, and culture of Egypt), Assyriology (the study of the ancient lands of present-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey), and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisite, and include archaeology, languages, history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, literature, and science. Students concentrating (majoring) in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.

The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs is a center for the study of global issues and public affairs and is one of the leading institutes of its type in the country. It occupies an architecturally distinctive building designed by Uruguayan architect <a href="Rafael%20Vi%C3%B1oly">Rafael Viñoly</a>. The Institute was initially endowed by <a href="Thomas%20Watson%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Watson, Jr.</a>, Brown class of 1937, former <a href="Ambassador%20to%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Ambassador to the Soviet Union</a>, and longtime president of <a href="IBM">IBM</a>. Institute faculty includes, or formerly included, Italian prime minister and <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> president <a href="Romano%20Prodi">Romano Prodi</a>, Brazilian president <a href="Fernando%20Henrique%20Cardoso">Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a>, Chilean president <a href="Ricardo%20Lagos">Ricardo Lagos Escobar</a>, Mexican novelist and statesman <a href="Carlos%20Fuentes">Carlos Fuentes</a>, Brazilian statesman and United Nations commission head <a href="Paulo%20S%C3%A9rgio%20Pinheiro">Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro</a>, Indian foreign minister and ambassador to the United States <a href="Nirupama%20Rao">Nirupama Rao</a>, American diplomat and <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Peace Accords</a> author <a href="Richard%20Holbrooke">Richard Holbrooke</a> (Brown '62), and <a href="Sergei%20Khrushchev">Sergei Khrushchev</a>, editor of the papers of his father <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, leader of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

The Institute's curricular interest is organized into the principal themes of development, security, and governance—with further focuses on globalization, economic uncertainty, security threats, environmental degradation, and poverty. Three Brown undergraduate concentrations (majors) are hosted by the Watson Institute—Development Studies, International Relations, and Public Policy. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Public Policy Program (M.P.A). The Institute also offers Post Doctoral, professional development and global outreach programming. In support of these programs, the Institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its <a href="Casualties%20of%20the%20Iraq%20War">Costs of War Project</a>, first released in 2011 and continuously updated. The Project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.

Established in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest civilian engineering program in the country, preceded only by <a href="Rensselaer%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> (1824) and <a href="Union%20College">Union College</a> (1845). In 1916 the departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a Division of Engineering, and in 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.

Engineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools, and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences. The School practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.

Since 2009 Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe; <a href="IE%20Business%20School">IE Business School</a> in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthened resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program. In this partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs. The cohort typically consists of 25-30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.
Classes are held in Providence, Madrid, Cape Town and Online.

The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was established at Brown in 1981 by <a href="Joan%20Wallach%20Scott">Joan Wallach Scott</a> as a research center on gender. It was named for Pembroke College, the former women's coordinate college at Brown, and is affiliated with Brown's <a href="Sarah%20Doyle%20Women%27s%20Center">Sarah Doyle Women's Center</a>. It supports the undergraduate concentration in <a href="Gender">Gender</a> and <a href="Human%20sexuality">Sexuality</a> Studies, post-doctoral research fellowships, the annual Pembroke Seminar, and other academic programs. The Center also manages various collections, archives, and resources, including the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive.

Established in 1887, the Graduate School has around 2,000 students studying over 50 disciplines. 20 different <a href="master%27s%20degrees">master's degrees</a> are offered as well as <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> degrees in over 40 subjects ranging from <a href="applied%20mathematics">applied mathematics</a> to <a href="public%20policy">public policy</a>. Overall, admission to the Graduate School is most competitive with an acceptance rate of about 10 percent.

The University's medical program started in 1811, but the school was suspended by President Wayland in 1827 after the program's faculty declined to live on campus (a new requirement under Wayland). In 1975, the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000. In January 2007, Warren Alpert donated $100 million to Brown Medical School, in recognition of which its name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

In 2014 "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>" ranked Brown's medical school the 5th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.9 percent.
"U.S. News" ranks it 29th for research and 28th in primary care.

The medical school is known especially for its eight-year <a href="Program%20in%20Liberal%20Medical%20Education">Program in Liberal Medical Education</a> (PLME), inaugurated in 1984. One of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, it offered admission to 90 of the 2,290 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2015, an acceptance rate of 3.9 percent. Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from <a href="Providence%20College">Providence College</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island%20College">Rhode Island College</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Rhode%20Island">University of Rhode Island</a>, and <a href="Tougaloo%20College">Tougaloo College</a>. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via <a href="AMCAS">AMCAS</a> like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers combined degree programs leading to the M.D./<a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a>, M.D./<a href="Master%20of%20Public%20Health">M.P.H.</a> and M.D./<a href="Master%20of%20Public%20Policy">M.P.P.</a> degrees.

The <a href="Marine%20Biological%20Laboratory">Marine Biological Laboratory</a> (MBL) is an independent research institution established in 1882 at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The laboratory is linked to 54 current or past <a href="Nobel%20Laureates">Nobel Laureates</a> who have been research or teaching faculty. Since 2005 the MBL and Brown have collaborated in a Ph.D. program in biological and environmental sciences that combines faculty at both institutions, including the faculties of the Ecosystems Center, the Bay Paul Center, the Program in Cellular Dynamics, and the Marine Resources Center.

For the undergraduate class of 2021, Brown received 32,724 applications, the largest applicant pool in the University's history, of whom 2,722 were accepted, for an acceptance rate of 8.3%, the lowest in university history. Additionally, for the academic year 2015-16 there were 1,834 transfer applicants, of whom 8.9% were accepted, with an SAT range of 2180-2330, ACT range of 31-34, and average college GPA of 3.85. In 2013 the Graduate School accepted 17 percent of 9,215 applicants. In 2014, "U.S. News" ranked Brown's Warren <a href="Alpert%20Medical%20School">Alpert Medical School</a> the 5th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.9 percent.

Brown admission policy is stipulated <a href="need-blind">need-blind</a> for all domestic applicants. Brown's financial aid basics website, in August 2014, stated: "For families (including both parents) with a total income below $60,000, and assets less than $100,000, no parent contribution is calculated towards the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). For families with total income below $100,000, the loan component of the financial aid award is replaced with additional scholarship." In 2013-14, the program awarded need-based scholarships worth $95 million. The average need-based award for the class of 2017 was $43,427.

Brown has committed to "minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts and promote environmental stewardship." The Energy and Environmental Advisory Committee has developed a set of ambitious goals for the university to reduce its <a href="carbon%20emissions">carbon emissions</a> and eventually achieve <a href="carbon%20neutrality">carbon neutrality</a>. The "Brown is Green" website collects information about Brown's progress toward greenhouse gas emissions reductions and related campus initiatives, such as student groups, courses, and research. Brown's grade of A-minus was the top one issued in the 2009 report of the Sustainable Endowments Institute (no A-grade was issued).
Brown has a number of active environmental leadership groups on campus. These groups have begun a number of campus-wide environmental initiatives—including promoting the reduction of supply and demand of bottled water and investigating a composting program.

Brown is a member of the <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> athletic conference, which is categorized as a <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a> (top level) conference of the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA). The Brown Bears are the third largest university sports program in the United States, sponsoring 38 <a href="varsity%20team">varsity</a> intercollegiate teams (Harvard sponsors 42 and Princeton 39). Brown's athletic program is one of the "U.S. News & World Report" top 20—the "College Sports Honor Roll"—based on breadth of program and athletes' graduation rates. Brown's newest varsity team is women's rugby, promoted from club-sport status in 2014.

Brown women's rowing has won 7 national titles in the last 14 years. <a href="Brown%20University%20Rowing">Brown men's rowing</a> perennially finishes in the top 5 in the nation, most recently winning silver, bronze, and silver in the national championship races of 2012, 2013, and 2014. The men's and women's crews have also won championship trophies at the <a href="Henley%20Royal%20Regatta">Henley Royal Regatta</a> and the <a href="Henley%20Women%27s%20Regatta">Henley Women's Regatta</a>. Brown's men's soccer is consistently ranked in the top 20, and has won 18 Ivy League titles overall; recent soccer graduates play professionally in <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> and overseas. Brown football, under its most successful coach historically, Phil Estes, won Ivy League championships in 1999, 2005, and 2008. (Brown football's reemergence is credited to its 1976 Ivy League championship team, "The Magnificent Andersons," so named for its coach, John Anderson.) High-profile alumni of the football program include <a href="Houston%20Texans">Houston Texans</a> head coach <a href="Bill%20O%27Brien%20%28American%20football%29">Bill O'Brien</a>; former <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Penn State</a> football coach <a href="Joe%20Paterno">Joe Paterno</a>, <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> namesake <a href="John%20W.%20Heisman">John W. Heisman</a>, and Pollard Award namesake <a href="Fritz%20Pollard">Fritz Pollard</a>. The Men's Lacrosse team also has a long and storied history. Brown women's gymnastics won the Ivy League tournament in 2013 and 2014. Brown varsity equestrian has won the Ivy League championship several times. Brown also supports competitive intercollegiate club sports, including <a href="sailing">sailing</a> and <a href="ultimate%20%28sport%29">ultimate frisbee</a>. The men's ultimate team, <a href="Brownian%20Motion%20%28Ultimate%29">Brownian Motion</a>, has twice won the national championship, in 2000 and 2005.

The first intercollegiate ice hockey game in America was played between Brown and Harvard on January 19, 1898. The first university rowing regatta larger than a dual-meet was held between Brown, Harvard, and Yale at Lake Quinsigamond in Massachusetts on July 26, 1859

In 2014, Brown University tied with the University of Connecticut for the highest number of reported rapes in the nation, with its "total of reports of rape" on their main campus standing at 43.

The weekend includes an annual spring concert festival which has featured numerous famous artists, including Bob Dylan, Childish Gambino, Bruce Springsteen, Bhudda, Chance the Rapper, Vampire Weekend, and Fetty Wap.

About 12 percent of Brown students are in fraternities and sororities. There are 11 residential Greek houses: six fraternities (Beta Rho Pi, <a href="Delta%20Phi">Delta Phi</a>, Delta Tau, <a href="Phi%20Kappa%20Psi">Phi Kappa Psi</a>, <a href="Sigma%20Chi">Sigma Chi</a>, and <a href="Theta%20Delta%20Chi">Theta Delta Chi</a>; three sororities (<a href="Alpha%20Chi%20Omega">Alpha Chi Omega</a>, <a href="Kappa%20Alpha%20Theta">Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, and <a href="Kappa%20Delta">Kappa Delta</a>), one co-ed house (<a href="Zeta%20Delta%20Xi">Zeta Delta Xi</a>), and one co-ed literary society (<a href="Alpha%20Delta%20Phi%23The%20Society">Alpha Delta Phi</a>). <a href="Phi%20Sigma%20Kappa">Phi Sigma Kappa</a> fraternity was present on campus from 1906 to 1939, but was unable to reactivate after World War II due to wartime losses. All recognized Greek-letter organizations are located on campus in Wriston Quadrangle in university-owned housing. They are overseen by the Greek Council.

An alternative to Greek-letter organizations are the program houses organized by themes. As with Greek houses, the residents of program houses select their new members, usually at the start of the spring semester. Examples of program houses are <a href="St.%20Anthony%20Hall">St. Anthony Hall</a> (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado <a href="French%20language">French</a>/<a href="Hispanic">Hispanic</a>/Latinx House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and <a href="Interfaith">Interfaith</a> House.

Currently, there are three student cooperative houses at Brown. Two of them, Watermyn and Finlandia on Waterman Street, are owned by the <a href="Brown%20Association%20for%20Cooperative%20Housing">Brown Association for Cooperative Housing</a> (BACH), a non-profit corporation owned by its members. The third co-op, West House, is located in a Brown-owned house on Brown Street. The three organizations run a vegetarian co-op for the larger community.

All students not in program housing enter a lottery for general housing. Students form groups and are assigned time slots during which they can pick among the remaining housing options.

The earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of <a href="Solomon%20Drowne">Solomon Drowne</a>, class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798. This was effectively a secret society with membership limited to 45. It met fortnightly to hear speeches and debate and thrived until the Civil War; in 1821 its library held 1594 volumes. In 1799 a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the College. In 1806 the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. "These two great rivals," says the University historian, "divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years." Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the University.
The Cammarian Club—founded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner food—was at first a semi-secret society which "tapped" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the Club served as the "de facto" undergraduate student government. In 1971, unaccountably, it voted the name Cammarian Club out of existence, thereby amputating its tradition and longevity. The successor and present-day organization is the generically-named Undergraduate Council of Students.

<a href="Societas%20Domi%20Pacificae">Societas Domi Pacificae</a>, known colloquially as "Pacifica House," is a present-day, self-described secret society, which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address. It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary "Franklin Society" traceable in the nineteenth century. But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented. It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch, Jr., and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823. The "Pacifica House" account of this (conflated) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859, 1876, and 1883. But the first of these (Rhees 1859, see footnote "infra") is merely a sketch of the 1824 Brown organization; the second (Stockwell 1876) is a reference-book article on the Providence Franklin Society itself; and the third is the Providence Franklin Society's own publication, which the "Pacifica House" reference mis-ascribes to the "Franklin Society," dropping the word "Providence."

There are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests. The Student Activities Fair, during the orientation program, provides first-year students the opportunity to become acquainted with the wide range of organizations. A sample of organizations includes:
Brown University has several resource centers on campus. The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some provide academic support as well.

The <a href="Brown%20Center%20for%20Students%20of%20Color">Brown Center for Students of Color</a> (BCSC) is a space that provides support for students <a href="People%20of%20color">of color</a>. Established in 1972 at the demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to engage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>. The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge and engage in discussion. Programs include the Third World Transition Program, the Minority Peer Counselor Program, the Heritage Series, and other student-led initiatives. Additionally, the BCSC hopes to foster community among the students it serves by providing spaces for students to meet and study.

The <a href="Sarah%20Doyle%20Women%27s%20Center">Sarah Doyle Women's Center</a> aims to provide a space for members of the Brown community to examine and explore issues surrounding <a href="gender">gender</a>. The center was named after one of the first women to attend Brown University, <a href="Sarah%20Doyle">Sarah Doyle</a>. The center emphasizes <a href="intersectionality">intersectionality</a> in its conversations on gender, encouraging people to see gender as present and relevant in various aspects of life. The center hosts programs and workshops in order to facilitate dialogue and provide resources for students, faculty, and staff.

Other centers include the <a href="LGBT">LGBTQ+</a> Center, the First-Generation College and Low-Income Student (FLi) Center, and the Curricular Resource Center.

Like many colleges, Brown mandates forced medical leaves for students expressing feelings of self-harm, depression, schizophrenia, or other forms of mental illness. Controversy arises within the college as to whether Brown follows the US Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, with Brown's own newspaper, The Brown Daily Herald, criticizing the University's policy behind readmission from psychological medical leave. According to a 2010 article in The Brown Daily Herald, even Dean of Student Life & Chair of the Medical Leave Readmission Committee, Maria Suarez, admits that “I wish we had more resources to connect with students,” Suarez said. “The support is there, but it is student-initiated.” However, Suarez has been widely criticized within and outside the University as being non-compliant with American ADA laws, often denying students readmission for little to no reason. Moreover, the University leaves students with few guidelines on how to become readmitted; students report that very little communication is made with the University during a leave of absence, and that the University does not aid disabled students in their progress. One mentally disabled student alleges, after 5 semesters of mandatory leave, that: "One of the administrators [Suarez], he claims, told him: "You should consider yourself lucky because Brown's better than other schools. At least you're not getting kicked out of Brown."' The psychological leave readmission process takes place once every 6 months, and requires only a student's statement and a psychiatrist's or psychologist's statement of well-being, with no interview. Many students report that the process is not thorough enough to judge one's own progress in mental health, thereby violating ADA rights; the denial letters are often short and generic, with one sentence changed at most for multiple denials.

Bill Atkinson

Bill Atkinson (born 1951) is an American <a href="computer%20engineer">computer engineer</a> and <a href="photographer">photographer</a>. Atkinson worked at <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Computer</a> from 1978 to 1990.

Atkinson was the principal designer and developer of the <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a> (GUI) of the <a href="Apple%20Lisa">Apple Lisa</a> and, later, one of the first thirty members of the original Apple <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> development team, and was the creator of the ground-breaking <a href="MacPaint">MacPaint</a> application, which fulfilled the vision of using the computer as a creative tool. He also designed and implemented <a href="QuickDraw">QuickDraw</a>, the fundamental toolbox that the Lisa and Macintosh used for graphics. QuickDraw's performance was essential for the success of the Macintosh GUI. He also was one of the main designers of the Lisa and Macintosh <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a>s. Atkinson also conceived, designed and implemented <a href="HyperCard">HyperCard</a>, the first popular <a href="hypermedia">hypermedia</a> system. HyperCard put the power of computer programming and database design into the hands of non<a href="programmer">programmer</a>s. In 1994, Atkinson received the <a href="EFF%20Pioneer%20Award">EFF Pioneer Award</a> for his contributions.

He received his undergraduate degree from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Diego">University of California, San Diego</a>, where Apple Macintosh developer <a href="Jef%20Raskin">Jef Raskin</a> was one of his professors. Atkinson continued his studies as a graduate student in neurochemistry at the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a>. Raskin invited Atkinson to visit him at <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple Computer</a>; <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> persuaded him to join the company immediately as employee #51, and Atkinson never finished his PhD.

Around 1990, <a href="General%20Magic">General Magic</a>'s founding, with Bill Atkinson as one of the three cofounders, met the following press in "<a href="Byte%20%28magazine%29">Byte</a>" magazine:
The obstacles to General Magic's success may appear daunting, but General Magic is not your typical start-up company. Its partners include some of the biggest players in the worlds of computing, communications, and consumer electronics, and it's loaded with top-notch engineers who have been given a clean slate to reinvent traditional approaches to ubiquitous worldwide communications.

In 2007, Atkinson began working as an outside developer with <a href="Numenta">Numenta</a>, a startup working on computer intelligence. On his work there Atkinson said, "what Numenta is doing is more fundamentally important to society than the personal computer and the rise of the Internet."

Currently, Atkinson has combined his passion for computer programming with his love of <a href="nature%20photography">nature photography</a> to create art images. He takes close-up photographs of stones that have been cut and polished. His works are highly regarded for their resemblance to miniature landscapes which are hidden within the stones. Atkinson’s 2004 book "Within the Stone" features a collection of his close-up photographs. The highly intricate and detailed images he creates are made possible by the accuracy and creative control of the digital printing process that he helped create.

Some of Atkinson's noteworthy contributions to the field of computing include:

Atkinson now works as a nature photographer. Actor <a href="Nelson%20Franklin">Nelson Franklin</a> portrayed him in the 2013 film, "<a href="Jobs%20%28film%29">Jobs</a>".

Battle of Lostwithiel

The Battles of Lostwithiel or Lostwithiel Campaign, took place near <a href="Lostwithiel">Lostwithiel</a> and <a href="Fowey">Fowey</a> in Cornwall during the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a> in 1644. They resulted in victory for the Royalists commanded by <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles</a> over the Parliamentarians commanded by the <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Earl of Essex</a>.

After defeating the army of Sir <a href="William%20Waller">William Waller</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cropredy%20Bridge">Battle of Cropredy Bridge</a>, King Charles marched west in pursuit of the Parliamentarian army of the Earl of Essex, who was invading the Royalist stronghold of <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>.

Essex had been misled into believing that he could expect substantial support from the people of Cornwall. When he had reached <a href="Bodmin">Bodmin</a> on 28 July, he found that there was no chance of supplies or recruits, and he also learned that the Royalist army was at <a href="Launceston%2C%20Cornwall">Launceston</a>, close to his rear. He withdrew to <a href="Lostwithiel">Lostwithiel</a>, covering the port of <a href="Fowey">Fowey</a>. Essex had previously arranged to rendezvous at Fowey with the Parliamentarian fleet under the <a href="Robert%20Rich%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Earl of Warwick</a>, but no ships appeared. Warwick was unable to leave <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> because of westerly winds.

Charles's army had been reinforced as it marched, and outnumbered that of Essex by nearly two to one. The first clashes took place on 2 August, but little action took place for several days, as the King waited for all his forces to arrive and Essex waited for the fleet.

On 13 August, the Royalists began to attack in earnest, occupying several outposts on the east bank of the <a href="River%20Fowey">River Fowey</a>, making it even more difficult for help to reach Essex. A Parliamentarian attempt to send a relieving force under Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Middleton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Middleton">Middleton</a> was defeated at <a href="Bridgwater">Bridgwater</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>.

On 21 August, the Royalists attacked Essex's positions north of Lostwithiel, capturing the ruins of <a href="Restormel%20Castle">Restormel Castle</a>. Royalist cavalry threatened to cut the Parliamentarians off from Fowey. Essex realised that there was no hope of relief and ordered his cavalry to break out of the encirclement. Under Sir <a href="William%20Balfour%20%28general%29">William Balfour</a>, they broke through the Royalist lines on the night of 31 August, eventually reaching <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> thirty miles to the east.

The increasingly demoralised Parliamentarian infantry fell back towards Fowey in pouring rain. They were forced to abandon several guns which became bogged down in the muddy roads. On 1 September, the pursuing Royalists captured <a href="Castle%20Dore">Castle Dore</a>, another ruined fortification which the Parliamentarians were using to anchor their lines. Essex left Sir <a href="Philip%20Skippon">Philip Skippon</a>, his Sergeant Major General of Foot, in command while he himself escaped to Plymouth in a fishing boat.

On 2 September, Skippon, having been told that his infantry were unable to break out as the cavalry had done, and having been offered generous terms by the King, surrendered 6,000 infantry and all his army's guns and train.

The disarmed soldiers marched eastward to Portsmouth in continuing bad weather, being continually robbed and threatened by local people. About 1,000 died of exposure and hunger, and 1,000 more deserted or fell sick.

Charles meanwhile wheeled about and marched towards London.

This setback for Parliament in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, and the last major victory for the Royalists, was reversed by <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Fairfax">Sir Thomas Fairfax</a> leading the <a href="New%20Model%20Army">New Model Army</a> at or near <a href="Tresillian">Tresillian Bridge</a>, close to <a href="Truro">Truro</a> on 12 March 1645.

Bertrand Russell

Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, (; 18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, <a href="mathematical%20logic">logician</a>, mathematician, historian, writer, <a href="social%20critic">social critic</a>, political activist and Nobel laureate. At various points in his life he considered himself a liberal, a socialist, and a <a href="pacifist">pacifist</a>, but he also admitted that he had "never been any of these things, in any profound sense". He was born in <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a> into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom.

In the early 20th century, Russell led the British "revolt against <a href="British%20Idealism">idealism</a>". He is considered one of the founders of <a href="analytic%20philosophy">analytic philosophy</a> along with his predecessor <a href="Gottlob%20Frege">Gottlob Frege</a>, colleague <a href="G.%20E.%20Moore">G. E. Moore</a>, and protégé <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier <a href="logician">logician</a>s. With <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">A. N. Whitehead</a> he wrote "<a href="Principia%20Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a>", an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics. His philosophical essay "<a href="On%20Denoting">On Denoting</a>" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy". His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics, <a href="logic">logic</a>, <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a>, <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a>, <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="cognitive%20science">cognitive science</a>, <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> (see <a href="type%20theory">type theory</a> and <a href="type%20system">type system</a>), and philosophy, especially the <a href="philosophy%20of%20language">philosophy of language</a>, <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>, and <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>.

Russell was a prominent <a href="Anti-war%20movement">anti-war activist</a>; he championed <a href="anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a>. Occasionally, he advocated <a href="Plan%20Totality">preventive nuclear war</a>, before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed, and "welcomed with enthusiasm" <a href="world%20government">world government</a>. He went to prison for his pacifism during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Later, he concluded war against Adolf Hitler was a necessary "lesser of two evils". He criticized <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>, attacked the involvement of the United States in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and was an outspoken proponent of <a href="nuclear%20disarmament">nuclear disarmament</a>. In 1950 Russell was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> "in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and <a href="freedom%20of%20thought">freedom of thought</a>".

Bertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872, at Ravenscroft, <a href="Trellech">Trellech</a>, <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a>, into an influential and liberal family of the <a href="British%20aristocracy">British aristocracy</a>. His parents, <a href="John%20Russell%2C%20Viscount%20Amberley">Viscount</a> and <a href="Katharine%20Russell%2C%20Viscountess%20Amberley">Viscountess Amberley</a>, were radical for their times. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist <a href="Douglas%20Spalding">Douglas Spalding</a>. Both were early advocates of <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a> at a time when this was considered scandalous. Lord Amberley was an <a href="atheist">atheist</a> and his atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> to act as Russell's secular godfather. Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.

His paternal grandfather, the <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Russell">Earl Russell</a>, had been asked twice by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> to form a government, serving her as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> in the 1840s and 1860s.
The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the peerage with the rise of the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a> (see: <a href="Duke%20of%20Bedford">Duke of Bedford</a>). They established themselves as one of the leading British <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> families, and participated in every great political event from the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in 1536–40 to the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> in 1688–89 and the <a href="Great%20Reform%20Act">Great Reform Act</a> in 1832.

Lady Amberley was the daughter of <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Stanley%20of%20Alderley">Lord</a> and <a href="Henrietta%20Stanley%2C%20Baroness%20Stanley%20of%20Alderley">Lady Stanley of Alderley</a>. Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother, one of the campaigners for <a href="education%20of%20women">education of women</a>.

Russell had two siblings: brother <a href="Frank%20Russell%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Russell">Frank</a> (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>, followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a> following a long period of <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly <a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorian</a> paternal grandparents, who lived at <a href="Pembroke%20Lodge%2C%20Richmond%20Park">Pembroke Lodge</a> in <a href="Richmond%20Park">Richmond Park</a>. His grandfather, former Prime Minister <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Russell">Earl Russell</a>, died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the <a href="Frances%20Russell%2C%20Countess%20Russell">Countess Russell</a> (née Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.

The countess was from a Scottish <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> family, and successfully petitioned the <a href="Court%20of%20Chancery">Court of Chancery</a> to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting <a href="Darwinism">Darwinism</a> and supporting <a href="Home%20Rule">Irish Home Rule</a>), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a> and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: "I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong".) Her favourite Bible verse, 'Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil' (<a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.

Russell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide. He was educated at home by a series of tutors. When Russell was eleven years old, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>, which transformed his life.

During these formative years he also discovered the works of <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. In his autobiography, he writes: "I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy". Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of <a href="Dogma%23In%20religion">Christian religious dogma</a>, which he found very unconvincing. At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no <a href="free%20will">free will</a> and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">Mill</a>'s "Autobiography", he abandoned the "<a href="First%20Cause">First Cause</a>" argument and became an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>.

Russell won a scholarship to read for the <a href="Mathematical%20Tripos">Mathematical Tripos</a> at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, and commenced his studies there in 1890, taking as coach <a href="Robert%20Rumsey%20Webb">Robert Rumsey Webb</a>. He became acquainted with the younger <a href="George%20Edward%20Moore">George Edward Moore</a> and came under the influence of <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a>, who recommended him to the <a href="Cambridge%20Apostles">Cambridge Apostles</a>. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh <a href="Wrangler%20%28University%20of%20Cambridge%29">Wrangler</a> in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.

Russell first met the American <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quaker</a> <a href="Alys%20Pearsall%20Smith">Alys Pearsall Smith</a> when he was 17 years old. He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family – they knew him primarily as “Lord John’s grandson” and enjoyed showing him off. He traveled with them to the continent; it was in their company that Russell visited the <a href="Paris%20Exhibition%20of%201889">Paris Exhibition of 1889</a> and was able to climb the <a href="Eiffel%20Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> soon after it was completed.

He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, who was a graduate of <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a> near <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage and they finally divorced in 1921, after a lengthy period of separation.
During this period, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including <a href="Lady%20Ottoline%20Morrell">Lady Ottoline Morrell</a> and the actress <a href="Lady%20Constance%20Malleson">Lady Constance Malleson</a>. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with <a href="Vivienne%20Haigh-Wood">Vivienne Haigh-Wood</a>, the English governess and writer, and first wife of <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>.

Russell began his published work in 1896 with "German Social Democracy", a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>. He was a member of the <a href="Coefficients%20%28dining%20club%29">Coefficients dining club</a> of social reformers set up in 1902 by the <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian</a> campaigners <a href="Sidney%20Webb">Sidney</a> and <a href="Beatrice%20Webb">Beatrice Webb</a>.

He now started an intensive study of the <a href="foundations%20of%20mathematics">foundations of mathematics</a> at Trinity.
In 1898 he wrote "An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry" which discussed the <a href="Cayley%E2%80%93Klein%20metric">Cayley–Klein metric</a>s used for <a href="non-Euclidean%20geometry">non-Euclidean geometry</a>.
He attended the <a href="International%20Congress%20of%20Philosophy">International Congress of Philosophy</a> in Paris in 1900 where he met <a href="Giuseppe%20Peano">Giuseppe Peano</a> and <a href="Alessandro%20Padoa">Alessandro Padoa</a>. The Italians had responded to <a href="Georg%20Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>, making a science of <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a>; they gave Russell their literature including the <a href="Formulario%20mathematico">Formulario mathematico</a>. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon <a href="Russell%27s%20paradox">Russell's paradox</a>. In 1903 he published "<a href="The%20Principles%20of%20Mathematics">The Principles of Mathematics</a>", a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of <a href="logicism">logicism</a>, that mathematics and logic are one and the same.

At the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a "sort of mystic illumination", after witnessing <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Whitehead</a>'s wife's acute suffering in an <a href="Angina%20pectoris">angina</a> attack. "I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty ... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a> to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable", Russell would later recall. "At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person."

In 1905 he wrote the essay "<a href="On%20Denoting">On Denoting</a>", which was published in the philosophical journal "<a href="Mind%20%28journal%29">Mind</a>". Russell was elected a <a href="List%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20elected%20in%201908">Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908</a>. The three-volume "<a href="Principia%20Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a>", written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier "The Principles of Mathematics", soon made Russell world-famous in his field.

In 1910 he became a lecturer in the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, where he was approached by the Austrian engineering student <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various <a href="phobia">phobia</a>s and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's "<a href="Tractatus%20Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a>" in 1922. Russell delivered his lectures on <a href="Logical%20Atomism">Logical Atomism</a>, his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> camp at the end of the conflict.

During World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active <a href="opposition%20to%20World%20War%20I">pacifist activities</a> and in 1916, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the <a href="Defence%20of%20the%20Realm%20Act%201914">Defence of the Realm Act 1914</a>. Russell played a significant part in the "Leeds Convention" in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand "anti-war socialists" gather; many being delegates from the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement. The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MPs</a>, including <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> and <a href="Philip%20Snowden">Philip Snowden</a>, as well as former <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor <a href="Arnold%20Lupton">Arnold Lupton</a>. After the event, Russell told <a href="Lady%20Ottoline%20Morrell">Lady Ottoline Morrell</a> that, "to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody".

The Trinity incident resulted in Russell being fined £100, which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Bible</a> that was stamped "Confiscated by Cambridge Police".

A later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the US to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in <a href="Brixton%20%28HM%20Prison%29">Brixton prison</a> (see "<a href="Bertrand%20Russell%27s%20views%20on%20society">Bertrand Russell's views on society</a>") in 1918. He later said of his imprisonment:

Russell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.

In 1924, Bertrand again gained press attention when attending a "banquet" in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> with well-known campaigners, including <a href="Arnold%20Lupton">Arnold Lupton</a>, who had been a <a href="Members%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> and had also endured imprisonment for "passive resistance to military or naval service".

In 1941, <a href="G.%20H.%20Hardy">G. H. Hardy</a> wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled "Bertrand Russell and Trinity" – published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by <a href="C.%20D.%20Broad">C. D. Broad</a> – in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.

The reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an “unusual application” and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the ‘world of learning’ knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the "Tarner Lectures" on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: "The Analysis of Matter", published in 1927. In the preface to this pamphlet, Hardy wrote:

In August 1920, Russell travelled to <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russia</a> as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution</a>. He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled "Soviet Russia1920", for the US magazine "<a href="The%20Nation">The Nation</a>". He met <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an "impish cruelty" in him and comparing him to "an opinionated professor". He cruised down the <a href="Volga">Volga</a> on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He wrote a book "The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism" about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the régime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.
Russell's lover <a href="Dora%20Russell">Dora Black</a>, a British author, <a href="feminist">feminist</a> and socialist campaigner, visited Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the revolution.

The following autumn Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited <a href="Beijing">Peking</a> (as it was then known in the West) to lecture on philosophy for a year. He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as <a href="History%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China%23Fight%20against%20warlordism%20and%20the%20First%20United%20Front">then being</a> on a new path. Other scholars present in China at the time included <a href="John%20Dewey">John Dewey</a> and <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, the Indian Nobel-laureate poet. Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20premature%20obituaries">incorrect reports</a> of his death were published in the Japanese press. When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading "Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists". Apparently they found this harsh and reacted resentfully.

Dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Russell's children with Dora were <a href="John%20Conrad%20Russell%2C%204th%20Earl%20Russell">John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell</a>, born on 16 November 1921, and <a href="Lady%20Katharine%20Tait">Katharine Jane Russell</a> (now Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of <a href="physics">physics</a>, ethics, and education to the layman.

From 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, spending summers in <a href="Porthcurno">Porthcurno</a>. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201922">1922</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">1923 general elections</a> Russell stood as a <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> candidate in the <a href="Chelsea%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Chelsea constituency</a>, but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was not on either occasion.

Together with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near <a href="Harting">Harting</a>, West Sussex. On 8 July 1930 Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.

On a tour through the US in 1927 Russell met Barry Fox (later <a href="Barry%20Stevens%20%28therapist%29">Barry Stevens</a>) who became a well-known <a href="Gestalt%20therapy">Gestalt therapist</a> and writer in later years. Russell and Fox developed an intensive relationship. In Fox's words: "... for three years we were very close." Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School for some time. From 1927 to 1932 Russell wrote 34 letters to Fox.

Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.

Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry. They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> undergraduate named <a href="Patricia%20Russell%20%28nee%20Spence%29">Patricia ("Peter") Spence</a>, who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, <a href="Conrad%20Russell%2C%205th%20Earl%20Russell">Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell</a>, 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrat</a> party.

Russell returned to the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a> to lecture on the science of power in 1937.

During the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of <a href="V.%20K.%20Krishna%20Menon">V. K. Krishna Menon</a>, then secretary of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian self-rule.

Russell opposed rearmament against <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. In 1937 he wrote in a personal letter: "If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister." In 1940, he changed his view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare: "War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils."

Before World War II, Russell taught at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the <a href="UCLA%20Department%20of%20Philosophy">UCLA Department of Philosophy</a>. He was appointed professor at the <a href="City%20College%20of%20New%20York">City College of New York</a> (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him "morally unfit" to teach at the college due to his opinions, especially those relating to <a href="sexual%20morality">sexual morality</a>, detailed in "<a href="Marriage%20and%20Morals">Marriage and Morals</a>" (1929). The protest was started by the mother of a student who would not have been eligible for his graduate-level course in mathematical logic; many intellectuals, led by <a href="John%20Dewey">John Dewey</a>, protested at his treatment. <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s oft-quoted aphorism that "great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds" originated in his open letter, dated 19 March 1940, to <a href="Morris%20Raphael%20Cohen">Morris Raphael Cohen</a>, a professor emeritus at CCNY, supporting Russell's appointment. Dewey and <a href="Horace%20M.%20Kallen">Horace M. Kallen</a> edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in "<a href="The%20Bertrand%20Russell%20Case">The Bertrand Russell Case</a>". He soon joined the <a href="Barnes%20Foundation">Barnes Foundation</a>, lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of "<a href="A%20History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy">A History of Western Philosophy</a>". His relationship with the eccentric <a href="Albert%20C.%20Barnes">Albert C. Barnes</a> soon soured, and he returned to the UK in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.

Russell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly "<a href="The%20Brains%20Trust">The Brains Trust</a>" and the <a href="BBC%20Third%20Programme">Third Programme</a>, on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>, Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an <a href="Bukken%20Bruse%20disaster">aeroplane crash in Hommelvik</a> in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane. "<a href="A%20History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy">A History of Western Philosophy</a>" (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.

In 1942 Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles, in an inquiry on <a href="Dialectical%20Materialism">Dialectical Materialism</a>, launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher <a href="Wolfgang%20Paalen">Wolfgang Paalen</a> in his journal "<a href="DYN%20%28magazine%29">DYN</a>", saying, "I think the metaphysics of both <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Hegel</a> and <a href="Karl%20Marx">Marx</a> plain nonsense – Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than <a href="Mary%20Baker%20Eddy">Mary Baker Eddy</a>'s. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism."
In 1943, Russell expressed support for <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a>: "I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to <a href="Jews">Jews</a> to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture".

In a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the <a href="Soviet%20Union">USSR</a>'s aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an <a href="Nuclear%20weapon">atomic bomb</a> than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides. At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's <a href="sphere%20of%20influence">sphere of influence</a>. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a <a href="first%20strike">first strike</a> in a war with the USSR, including <a href="Nigel%20Lawson">Nigel Lawson</a>, who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.
However, just after the atomic bombs exploded over <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a> and <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the USA possessed them and before the USSR did. In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union. After it became known that the USSR carried out <a href="List%20of%20nuclear%20weapons%20tests%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">its nuclear bomb tests</a>, Russell declared his position advocating for the total abolition of atomic weapons.

In 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural <a href="Reith%20Lectures">Reith Lectures</a>—what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled "Authority and the Individual", explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to "Words and Things" by <a href="Ernest%20Gellner">Ernest Gellner</a>, which was highly critical of the later thought of <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> and of <a href="ordinary%20language%20philosophy">ordinary language philosophy</a>. <a href="Gilbert%20Ryle">Gilbert Ryle</a> refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal "<a href="Mind%20%28journal%29">Mind</a>", which caused Russell to respond via "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>". The result was a month-long correspondence in "The Times" between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.

In the <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit%20%28Commonwealth%29">Order of Merit</a>, and the following year he was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>. When he was given the Order of Merit, <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, "You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted". Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply "That's right, just like your <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">brother</a>" immediately came to mind. In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).

Russell married his fourth wife, <a href="Edith%20Finch%20Russell">Edith Finch</a>, soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend <a href="Lucy%20Donnelly">Lucy Donnelly</a>. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious <a href="mental%20illness">mental illness</a>, which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.

In September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in <a href="HM%20Prison%20Brixton">Brixton Prison</a> for "breach of peace" after taking part in <a href="Committee%20of%20100%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%231961">an anti-nuclear demonstration</a> in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to "good behaviour", to which Russell replied: "No, I won't."

In 1962 Russell played a public role in the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis%23Crisis%20deepens">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless. Russell sent this telegram to <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">President Kennedy</a>:
YOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR... END THIS MADNESS.

According to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination">assassination</a>, Russell, "prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer <a href="Mark%20Lane%20%28author%29">Mark Lane</a> in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee in June 1964, members of which included <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a> MP, <a href="Caroline%20Benn">Caroline Benn</a>, the publisher <a href="Victor%20Gollancz">Victor Gollancz</a>, the writers <a href="John%20Arden">John Arden</a> and <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a>, and the Oxford history professor <a href="Hugh%20Trevor-Roper">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a>. Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the <a href="Warren%20Commission">Warren Commission</a> Report was published, setting forth "16 Questions on the Assassination" and equating the Oswald case with the <a href="Dreyfus%20affair">Dreyfus affair</a> of late 19th-century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.

Russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to <a href="nuclear%20disarmament">nuclear disarmament</a> and opposing the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. The 1955 <a href="Russell%E2%80%93Einstein%20Manifesto">Russell–Einstein Manifesto</a> was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time. In 1966–67, Russell worked with <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> and many other intellectual figures to form the <a href="Russell%20Tribunal">Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal</a> to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam. He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.

In 1956, immediately before and during the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>, Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> area "where general interest is involved". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarian Revolution</a> and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets "because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which <a href="Michael%20Polanyi">Michael Polanyi</a> had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.

In November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and Soviet Premier <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, urging a summit to consider "the conditions of co-existence". Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany "freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West". US Secretary of State <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a> replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as "The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles".

Russell was asked by "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>", a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all <a href="Thermonuclear%20weapon">hydrogen bombs</a>, with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the <a href="Oder-Neisse%20line">Oder-Neisse line</a> as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>, and <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing <a href="Arab%20nationalism">Arab nationalism</a>, and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard <a href="Israel">Israel</a>'s frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the <a href="China">People's Republic of China</a>, and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a>.

He was in contact with <a href="Lionel%20Rogosin">Lionel Rogosin</a> while the latter was filming his anti-war film "<a href="Good%20Times%2C%20Wonderful%20Times">Good Times, Wonderful Times</a>" in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the <a href="New%20Left">New Left</a>. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and felt that the US government's policies there were near-<a href="genocide">genocidal</a>. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the <a href="Jerusalem%20Prize">Jerusalem Prize</a>, an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society. In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab countries</a> to accept an <a href="arms%20embargo">arms embargo</a> and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry. In October 1965 he tore up his <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> card because he suspected <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>'s Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.

In June 1955 Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in <a href="Penrhyndeudraeth">Penrhyndeudraeth</a>, Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.
Russell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> playing himself in the anti-war <a href="Hindi%20language">Hindi</a> film "Aman" which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.

On 23 November 1969 he wrote to "The Times" newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> was "highly alarming". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General <a href="U%20Thant">U Thant</a> of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. The following month, he protested to <a href="Alexei%20Kosygin">Alexei Kosygin</a> over the expulsion of <a href="Aleksandr%20Solzhenitsyn">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a> from the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20of%20Writers">Soviet Union of Writers</a>.

On 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning "<a href="Israel">Israel</a>'s aggression in the Middle East", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the <a href="War%20of%20Attrition">War of Attrition</a>. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-<a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a> borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.

Russell died of <a href="influenza">influenza</a> on 2 February 1970 at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth. His body was cremated in <a href="Colwyn%20Bay">Colwyn Bay</a> on 5 February 1970. In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony; his ashes were scattered over the Welsh mountains later that year. He left an estate valued at £69,423.
In 1980 a memorial to Russell was commissioned by a committee including the philosopher <a href="A.%20J.%20Ayer">A. J. Ayer</a>. It consists of a bust of Russell in <a href="Red%20Lion%20Square">Red Lion Square</a> in London sculpted by Marcelle Quinton.

Russell held throughout his life the following <a href="Style%20%28manner%20of%20address%29">styles</a> and honours:

Russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of <a href="analytic%20philosophy">analytic philosophy</a>. He was deeply impressed by <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> (1646–1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>. He was particularly prolific in the field of <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, the <a href="Bertrand%20Russell%27s%20views%20on%20philosophy%23Logic%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics">logic and the philosophy of mathematics</a>, the <a href="Bertrand%20Russell%27s%20views%20on%20philosophy%23Philosophy%20of%20language">philosophy of language</a>, <a href="Bertrand%20Russell%27s%20views%20on%20philosophy%23Ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="Bertrand%20Russell%27s%20views%20on%20philosophy%23Epistemology">epistemology</a>. When <a href="Brand%20Blanshard">Brand Blanshard</a> asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, "but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects".

On ethics, Russell considered himself a <a href="utilitarian">utilitarian</a>.

Russell once described himself as an agnostic, "speaking to a purely philosophical audience", but as an <a href="atheist">atheist</a> "speaking popularly", on the basis that he could not disprove the Christian God – similar to the way that he could not disprove the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympic gods</a> either. For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than <a href="superstition">superstition</a> and, in spite of any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the <a href="British%20Humanist%20Association">British Humanist Association</a> and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death. However, in his 1951 work, Impact of Science on Society, Bertrand issues something of a spiritual confession: "The root of the matter is a very simple and old fashioned thing, a thing so simple that I am almost ashamed to admit it, for fear of the derisive smile with which wiser minds will greet my words. The thing I mean - please forgive me for mentioning it, is love, Christian love or compassion. If you feel this, you have a motive for existence, a guide for action, a reason for courage, an imperative necessary for intellectual honesty" Bertrand apparently left his modernist '..firm foundation of unyielding despair' behind during the later years of his life.

Political and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.

Russell argued for a "scientific society", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared. He suggested the establishment of a "single supreme world government" able to enforce peace, claiming that "the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation".

Russell was an active supporter of the <a href="Homosexual%20Law%20Reform%20Society">Homosexual Law Reform Society</a>, being one of the signatories of <a href="A.%20E.%20Dyson">A. E. Dyson</a>'s 1958 letter to "The Times" calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.

In "Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday" ("Postscript" in his "Autobiography"), Russell wrote: "I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken".

Below is a selected bibliography of Russell's books in English, sorted by year of first publication:

Russell was the author of more than sixty books and over two thousand articles. Additionally, he wrote many pamphlets, introductions, and letters to the editor. One pamphlet titled, "'I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors", ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist <a href="Stephen%20Hobhouse">Stephen Hobhouse</a>, allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>s.

His works can be found in anthologies and collections, including "The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell", which <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a> began publishing in 1983. By March 2017 this collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works included 18 volumes, and several more are in progress. A bibliography in three additional volumes catalogues his publications. The Russell Archives held by McMaster's <a href="William%20Ready%20Division%20of%20Archives%20and%20Research%20Collections">William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections</a> possess over 40,000 of his letters.

Boeing 767

The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, <a href="flight%20length">mid- to long-range</a>, <a href="Wide-body%20aircraft">wide-body</a> <a href="Twinjet">twin-engine</a> <a href="jet%20airliner">jet airliner</a> built by <a href="Boeing%20Commercial%20Airplanes">Boeing Commercial Airplanes</a>. It was Boeing's first wide-body <a href="twinjet">twinjet</a> and its first airliner with a two-crew <a href="glass%20cockpit">glass cockpit</a>. The aircraft has two <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> engines, a conventional <a href="tailplane">tail</a>, and, for reduced <a href="aerodynamic%20drag">aerodynamic drag</a>, a <a href="supercritical%20airfoil">supercritical wing</a> design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the <a href="Boeing%20747">747</a>, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a <a href="Range%20%28aeronautics%29">design range</a> of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a <a href="Narrow-body%20aircraft">narrow-body</a> twinjet, the <a href="Boeing%20757">757</a>, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common <a href="type%20rating">type rating</a> to operate both aircraft.

The 767 is produced in three <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a> lengths. The original 767-200 entered service in 1982, followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER, an extended-range (ER) variant, in 2000. The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988, respectively, while a production <a href="Cargo%20aircraft">freighter</a> version, the 767-300F, debuted in 1995. Conversion programs have modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use, while military derivatives include the <a href="Boeing%20E-767">E-767</a> <a href="Airborne%20early%20warning%20and%20control">surveillance</a> aircraft, the <a href="Boeing%20KC-767">KC-767</a> and <a href="Boeing%20KC-46">KC-46</a> aerial <a href="aerial%20refueling">tankers</a>, and VIP transports. Engines featured on the 767 include the <a href="General%20Electric%20CF6">General Electric CF6</a>, <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT9D">Pratt & Whitney JT9D</a> and <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW4000">PW4000</a>, and <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a> turbofans.

<a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and <a href="Transcontinental%20flight%20across%20the%20United%20States">transcontinental</a> routes, during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand <a href="Non-stop%20flight">non-stop</a> service on <a href="Flight%20length">medium- to long-haul</a> intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the development of the <a href="Boeing%20777">777</a>, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for <a href="transatlantic%20flight">transatlantic flight</a>s between <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

The 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered. As of August 2017, Boeing has received 1,204 orders for the 767 from 74 customers; 1,102 have been delivered. A total of 742 of these aircraft were in service in July 2016; the most popular variant is the 767-300ER, with 583 delivered; <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> is the largest operator, with 91 aircraft. Competitors have included the <a href="Airbus%20A300">Airbus A300</a>, <a href="Airbus%20A310">A310</a>, and <a href="Airbus%20A330">A330-200</a>, while a successor, the <a href="Boeing%20787%20Dreamliner">787 Dreamliner</a>, entered service in October 2011. Despite this, the 767 still remains in production.

In 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service. The 747 was the first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin. Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the <a href="Boeing%20707">707</a> and other early generation narrow-body jets. The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10</a>, and <a href="Lockheed%20L-1011%20TriStar">Lockheed L-1011 TriStar</a> wide-bodies. To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation <a href="Aeritalia">Aeritalia</a> and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation. The initial 7X7 was conceived as a <a href="STOL">short take-off and landing</a> airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a <a href="T-tail">T-tail</a>.
By 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the <a href="Airbus%20A300">Airbus A300</a>, became the baseline configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including <a href="high-bypass%20turbofan">high-bypass-ratio turbofan</a> engines, new flight deck systems, <a href="aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a> improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.

In January 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its <a href="Boeing%20Everett%20Factory">Everett factory</a>—which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family. In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation, and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a <a href="trijet">trijet</a> 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes. The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes. The 767 was officially launched on July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> and Delta Air Lines later that year. The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's seating, while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.

In the late 1970s, <a href="operating%20cost">operating cost</a> replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized <a href="fuel%20efficiency">fuel efficiency</a> from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30 percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used <a href="computer-aided%20design">computer-aided design</a> for over a third of the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including <a href="avionics">avionics</a>, <a href="flight%20management%20system">flight management system</a>s, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4 billion.
Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt & Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner. Both jet engine models had a maximum output of of <a href="Jet%20engine%23Thrust">thrust</a>. The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets. The larger wings were designed using an <a href="Supercritical%20airfoil">aft-loaded</a> shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed <a href="lift%20%28force%29">lift</a> more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft. The wings provided higher-altitude <a href="Cruise%20%28flight%29">cruise</a> performance, added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants. The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic, and would be capable of operating routes up to .

The 767's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at . While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag. The fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body <a href="unit%20load%20device">unit load device</a>s side-by-side, so a smaller container, the LD2, was created specifically for the 767. Using a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section, providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.
The 767 was the first Boeing wide-body to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">Cathode ray tube</a> (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the <a href="flight%20engineer">flight engineer</a> by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. <a href="Ansett%20Australia">Ansett Australia</a> ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.

To produce the 767, Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, <a href="Boeing%20Rotorcraft%20Systems">Boeing Vertol</a> made the <a href="leading%20edge">leading edge</a> for the wings, and <a href="Spirit%20AeroSystems">Boeing Wichita</a> produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely <a href="Fuji%20Heavy%20Industries">Fuji Heavy Industries</a> (<a href="Aircraft%20fairing">wing fairings</a> and gear doors), <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> (center fuselage), and <a href="Mitsubishi%20Heavy%20Industries">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</a> (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing <a href="Spar%20%28aviation%29">spars</a>, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received <a href="robot">robot</a>ic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting <a href="fastener">fastener</a>s. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.
The prototype aircraft, <a href="aircraft%20registration">registered</a> N767BA and equipped with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a>, <a href="All%20Nippon%20Airways">All Nippon Airways</a>, <a href="Britannia%20Airways">Britannia Airways</a>, <a href="Transbrasil">Transbrasil</a>, and <a href="Trans%20World%20Airlines">Trans World Airlines</a> (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its <a href="maiden%20flight">maiden flight</a> under the command of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> because of a <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic</a> fluid leak. The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.

The 10-month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built. The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines. The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance, while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights. During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets. Following 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) and the UK <a href="Civil%20Aviation%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Aviation Authority</a> (CAA) in July 1982. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines. The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.

The 767 entered service with United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first commercial flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service three months later with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, <a href="China%20Airlines">China Airlines</a>, and <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater <a href="Dispatch%20%28logistics%29">dispatch</a> <a href="Reliability%20engineering">reliability</a> than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1 percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an <a href="evacuation%20slide">evacuation slide</a> latch, and the repair of a <a href="tailplane">tailplane</a> pivot to match production specifications.
Seeking to capitalize on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, in its first year of service. <a href="Ethiopian%20Airlines">Ethiopian Airlines</a> placed the first order for the type in December 1982. Featuring increased <a href="gross%20weight">gross weight</a> and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier <a href="Payload%20%28air%20and%20space%20craft%29">payloads</a> at distances up to , and was targeted at overseas customers. The 767-200ER entered service with <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> Airline on March 27, 1984. The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.

In the mid-1980s, the 767 spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (<a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a>) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could be no more than 90 minutes away from <a href="diversion%20airport">diversion airport</a>s. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.

Forecasting airline interest in larger-capacity models, Boeing announced the stretched 767-300 in 1983 and the extended-range 767-300ER in 1984. Both models offered a 20 percent passenger capacity increase, while the extended-range version was capable of operating flights up to . <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a> placed the first order for the 767-300 in September 1983. Following its first flight on January 30, 1986, the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20, 1986. The 767-300ER completed its first flight on December 9, 1986, but it was not until March 1987 that the first firm order, from American Airlines, was placed. The type entered service with American Airlines on March 3, 1988. The 767-300 and 767-300ER gained popularity after entering service, and came to account for approximately two-thirds of all 767s sold.

After the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for greater capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the "Hunchback of Mukilteo" (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage. In 1986, Boeing proposed the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest. By 1988, the 767-X had evolved into an all-new twinjet, which revived the <a href="Boeing%20777">777</a> designation. Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest wide-bodies behind the 747.
Buoyed by a recovering global economy and ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By the end of the decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of <a href="Point-to-point%20transit">point-to-point</a> flights which bypassed major <a href="airline%20hub">airline hub</a>s in favor of <a href="direct%20flight">direct routes</a>. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional <a href="Spoke-hub%20distribution%20paradigm">hub-and-spoke</a> model.

In February 1990, the first 767 equipped with <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a> turbofans, a 767-300, was delivered to <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a>. Six months later, the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the <a href="hardpoint">engine pylons</a> of several aircraft. The cracks were related to the extra weight of the RB211 engines, which are heavier than other 767 engines. During the grounding, interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components, and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks. Boeing also performed a structural reassessment, resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service.
In January 1993, following an order from <a href="UPS%20Airlines">UPS Airlines</a>, Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995. The 767-300F featured a main deck cargo hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure. In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the , an <a href="Airborne%20Early%20Warning%20and%20Control">Airborne Early Warning and Control</a> (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER. The first two , featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance <a href="radar">radar</a> and other monitoring equipment, were delivered in 1998 to the <a href="Japan%20Self-Defense%20Forces">Japan Self-Defense Forces</a>.

In November 1995, after abandoning development of a smaller version of the 777, Boeing announced that it was revisiting studies for a larger 767. The proposed 767-400X, a second stretch of the aircraft, offered a 12 percent capacity increase versus the 767-300, and featured an upgraded flight deck, enhanced interior, and greater wingspan. The variant was specifically aimed at Delta Air Lines' pending replacement of its aging Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, and faced competition from the A330-200, a shortened derivative of the Airbus A330. In March 1997, Delta Air Lines launched the 767-400ER when it ordered the type to replace its L-1011 fleet. In October 1997, <a href="Continental%20Airlines">Continental Airlines</a> also ordered the 767-400ER to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet. The type completed its first flight on October 9, 1999, and entered service with Continental Airlines on September 14, 2000.

In the early 2000s, cumulative 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn. In 2001, Boeing dropped plans for a longer-range model, the 767-400ERX, in favor of the proposed <a href="Boeing%20Sonic%20Cruiser">Sonic Cruiser</a>, a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15 percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 767. The following year, Boeing announced the <a href="Boeing%20KC-767%23International%20programs">KC-767 Tanker Transport</a>, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER. Launched with an order in October 2002 from the <a href="Italian%20Air%20Force">Italian Air Force</a>, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo. The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003. In May 2003, the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging <a href="Boeing%20KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135</a> tankers. The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> <a href="Boeing%20KC-767%23USAF%20lease%20and%20cancellation">scandal</a>, resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including <a href="Philip%20M.%20Condit">Philip Condit</a>, the company's <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a>, and <a href="chief%20financial%20officer">chief financial officer</a> Michael Sears. The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.

In late 2002, after airlines expressed reservations about its emphasis on speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a>s which promised to be 20 percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the <a href="Boeing%20Yellowstone%20Project">Boeing Yellowstone Project</a>. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including <a href="Aircraft%20maintenance%20checks">D-check</a> teardowns and inspections for <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.
In 2007, the 767 received a production boost when UPS and <a href="DHL%20Aviation">DHL Aviation</a> placed a combined 33 orders for the 767-300F. Renewed freighter interest led Boeing to consider enhanced versions of the 767-200 and 767-300F with increased gross weights, 767-400ER wing extensions, and 777 avionics. Net orders for the 767 declined from 24 in 2008 to just three in 2010. During the same period, operators upgraded aircraft already in service; in 2008, the first 767-300ER retrofitted with blended <a href="Wingtip%20device">winglets</a> from <a href="Aviation%20Partners%20Inc.">Aviation Partners Incorporated</a> debuted with American Airlines. The manufacturer-sanctioned winglets, at in height, improved fuel efficiency by an estimated 6.5 percent. Other carriers including All Nippon Airways and Delta Air Lines also ordered winglet kits.

On February 2, 2011, the 1,000th 767 rolled out, destined for All Nippon Airways. The aircraft was the 91st 767-300ER ordered by the Japanese carrier, and with its completion the 767 became the second wide-body airliner to reach the thousand-unit milestone after the 747. The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line. Beginning with the 1,001st aircraft, production moved to another area in the Everett factory which occupied about half of the previous floor space. The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over twenty percent.

At the inauguration of its new assembly line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its <a href="KC-X">KC-X</a> fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> parent <a href="EADS">EADS</a>, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.

In December 2011, <a href="FedEx%20Express">FedEx Express</a> announced a 767-300F order for 27 aircraft to replace its DC-10 freighters, citing the USAF tanker order and Boeing's decision to continue production as contributing factors. FedEx Express agreed to buy an additional 19 of the −300F variant in June 2012. In June 2015, FedEx said it was accelerating retirements of planes both to reflect demand and to modernize its fleet, recording charges of $276 million. On July 21, 2015 FedEx announced an order for 50 767-300F with options on another 50, the largest order for the type. FedEx confirmed that it has firm orders for 106 of the freighters for delivery between 2018 and 2023.

The 767 is a low-wing <a href="Cantilever%20wing">cantilever monoplane</a> with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder. The wings are swept at 31.5 degrees and optimized for a cruising speed of <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 0.8 (). Each wing features a supercritical cross-section and is equipped with six-panel <a href="leading%20edge%20slat">leading edge slat</a>s, single- and double-slotted <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a>, inboard and outboard <a href="aileron">aileron</a>s, and six <a href="Spoiler%20%28aeronautics%29">spoilers</a>. The <a href="airframe">airframe</a> further incorporates <a href="Carbon-fiber-reinforced%20polymer">Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer</a> <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a> wing surfaces, <a href="Kevlar">Kevlar</a> <a href="Aircraft%20fairing">fairings</a> and access panels, plus improved <a href="aluminium%20alloy">aluminum alloys</a>, which together reduce overall weight by versus preceding aircraft.

To distribute the aircraft's weight on the ground, the 767 has a retractable <a href="Tricycle%20gear">tricycle landing gear</a> with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear. The original wing and gear design accommodated the stretched 767-300 without major changes. The 767-400ER features a larger, more widely spaced main gear with 777 wheels, tires, and brakes. To prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff, 767-300 and 767-400ER models are fitted with a retractable <a href="tailstrike">tailskid</a>. The 767 has left-side exit doors near the front and rear of the aircraft.

In addition to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 uses the same <a href="auxiliary%20power%20unit">auxiliary power unit</a>, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common <a href="type%20rating">type rating</a> to operate the 757 and share the same <a href="seniority">seniority</a> roster with pilots of either aircraft.

The original 767 flight deck uses six <a href="Rockwell%20Collins">Rockwell Collins</a> CRT screens to display <a href="Electronic%20flight%20instrument%20system">Electronic flight instrument system</a> (EFIS) and <a href="Electronic%20flight%20instrument%20system%23Engine%20indications%20and%20crew%20alerting%20system%20%28EICAS%29%20/%20electronic%20centralized%20aircraft%20monitoring%20%28ECAM%29">engine indication and crew alerting system</a> (EICAS) information, allowing pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously performed by the flight engineer. The CRTs replace conventional <a href="electromechanics">electromechanical</a> instruments found on earlier aircraft. An enhanced flight management system, improved over versions used on early 747s, automates navigation and other functions, while an <a href="Autoland">automatic landing</a> system facilitates <a href="Instrument%20landing%20system">CAT IIIb</a> instrument landings in low visibility situations. The 767 became the first aircraft to receive CAT IIIb certification from the FAA for landings with minimum visibility in 1984. On the 767-400ER, the cockpit layout is simplified further with six Rockwell Collins <a href="liquid%20crystal%20display">liquid crystal display</a> (LCD) screens, and adapted for similarities with the 777 and the <a href="Boeing%20737%20Next%20Generation">Next Generation 737</a>. To retain operational <a href="Fleet%20commonality">commonality</a>, the LCD screens can be programmed to display information in the same manner as earlier 767s. In 2012, Boeing and Rockwell Collins launched a further 787-based cockpit upgrade for the 767, featuring three landscape-format LCD screens that can display two windows each.

The 767 is equipped with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A <a href="ram%20air%20turbine">ram air turbine</a> provides power for basic controls in the event of an emergency. An early form of <a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a> is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.

The 767 features a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in <a href="business%20class">business class</a> and seven across in <a href="economy%20class">economy</a>. The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87 percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats need to be filled, and each passenger is no more than one seat from the aisle. It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.

The 767 interior introduced larger <a href="Airliner%23Overhead%20bins">overhead bins</a> and more lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate <a href="garment%20bag">garment bag</a>s without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large <a href="Galley%20%28kitchen%29">galley</a> is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and service doors are an overhead <a href="Plug%20door">plug</a> type, which retract upwards, and commonly used doors can be equipped with an <a href="electric%20motor">electric-assist</a> system.

In 2000, a 777-style interior, known as the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently adopted for all new-build 767s, the Signature Interior features even larger overhead bins, indirect lighting, and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior. Some operators have adopted a simpler modification known as the Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling panels and indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.

The 767 has been produced in three fuselage lengths. These debuted in progressively larger form as the 767-200, 767-300, and 767-400ER. Longer-range variants include the 767-200ER and 767-300ER, while cargo models include the 767-300F, a production freighter, and conversions of passenger 767-200 and 767-300 models.

When referring to different variants, Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number (767) and the variant designator (e.g. –200 or –300) into a truncated form (e.g. "762" or "763"). Subsequent to the capacity number, designations may append the range identifier. The <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) aircraft type designator system uses a similar numbering scheme, but adds a preceding manufacturer letter; all variants based on the 767-200 and 767-300 are classified under the codes "B762" and "B763"; the 767-400ER receives the designation of "B764".

The 767-200 was the original model and entered service with <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> in 1982. The type has been used primarily by <a href="Mainline%20%28flight%29">mainline</a> U.S. carriers for domestic routes between major hub centers such as Los Angeles to Washington. The 767-200 was the first aircraft to be used on transatlantic <a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a> flights, beginning with TWA on February 1, 1985 under 90-minute diversion rules. Deliveries for the variant totaled 128 aircraft. There were 44 passenger and freighter conversions of the model in commercial service as of July 2016. The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310.

The 767-200 ceased production in the late 1980s, superseded by the extended-range 767-200ER. Some early 767-200s were subsequently upgraded to extended-range specification. In 1998, Boeing began offering 767-200 conversions to 767-200SF (Special Freighter) specification for cargo use, and <a href="Israel%20Aerospace%20Industries">Israel Aerospace Industries</a> has been licensed to perform cargo conversions since 2005. The conversion process entails the installation of a side cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and added freight monitoring and safety equipment. The 767-200SF was positioned as a replacement for <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a> freighters.

A commercial freighter version of the Boeing 767-200 with series 300 wings and an updated flightdeck was first flown on 29 December 2014. A military tanker variant of the Boeing 767-2C is being developed for the USAF as the KC-46. Boeing is building two aircraft as commercial freighters which will be used to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification, a further two Boeing 767-2Cs will be modified as military tankers. , Boeing does not have customers for the freighter.

The 767-200ER was the first extended-range model and entered service with <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> in 1984. The type's increased range is due to an additional center fuel tank and a higher <a href="maximum%20takeoff%20weight">maximum takeoff weight</a> (MTOW) of up to . The type was originally offered with the same engines as the 767-200, while more powerful <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW4000">Pratt & Whitney PW4000</a> and <a href="General%20Electric%20CF6">General Electric CF6</a> engines later became available. The 767-200ER was the first 767 to complete a non-stop <a href="Transatlantic%20flight">transatlantic</a> journey, and broke the flying distance record for a twinjet airliner on April 17, 1988 with an <a href="Air%20Mauritius">Air Mauritius</a> flight from Halifax, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> to Port Louis, <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, covering . The 767-200ER has been acquired by international operators seeking smaller wide-body aircraft for long-haul routes such as New York to Beijing. Deliveries of the type totaled 121 with no unfilled orders. As of July 2016, 32 examples of passenger and freighter conversion versions were in airline service. The type's main competitors of the time included the <a href="Airbus%20A300-600">Airbus A300-600</a>R and the <a href="Airbus%20A310-300">A310-300</a>.

The 767-300, the first stretched version of the aircraft, entered service with <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a> in 1986. The type features a fuselage extension over the 767-200, achieved by additional sections inserted before and after the wings, for an overall length of . Reflecting the growth potential built into the original 767 design, the wings, engines, and most systems were largely unchanged on the 767-300. An optional mid-cabin exit door is positioned ahead of the wings on the left, while more powerful Pratt & Whitney PW4000 and <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a> engines later became available. The 767-300's increased capacity has been used on high-density routes within Asia and Europe. Deliveries for the type totaled 104 aircraft with no unfilled orders remaining. As of July 2016, 54 of the variant were in airline service. The type's main competitor was the Airbus A300.

The 767-300ER, the extended-range version of the 767-300, entered service with American Airlines in 1988. The type's increased range was made possible by greater fuel tankage and a higher MTOW of . Design improvements allowed the available MTOW to increase to by 1993. Power is provided by Pratt & Whitney PW4000, General Electric CF6, or Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. Typical routes for the type include <a href="Los%20Angeles%20International%20Airport">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="Frankfurt%20Airport">Frankfurt</a>. The combination of increased capacity and range offered by the 767-300ER has been particularly attractive to both new and existing 767 operators. It is the most successful version of the aircraft, with more orders placed than all other variants combined. As of August 2017, 767-300ER deliveries stand at 583 with no unfilled orders. There were 441 examples in service as of July 2016. The type's main competitor is the <a href="Airbus%20A330-200">Airbus A330-200</a>.

The 767-300F, the production freighter version of the 767-300ER, entered service with UPS Airlines in 1995. The 767-300F can hold up to 24 standard <a href="pallet">pallet</a>s on its main deck and up to 30 LD2 <a href="unit%20load%20device">unit load device</a>s on the lower deck, with a total cargo volume of . The freighter has a main deck cargo door and crew exit, while the lower deck features two port-side cargo doors and one starboard cargo door. A general market version with onboard freight-handling systems, <a href="refrigeration">refrigeration</a> capability, and crew facilities was delivered to <a href="Asiana%20Airlines">Asiana Airlines</a> on August 23, 1996. As of August 2017, 767-300F deliveries stand at 128 with 64 unfilled orders. Airlines operated 134 examples of the freighter variant and freighter conversions in July 2016.

In June 2008, All Nippon Airways took delivery of the first 767-300BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), a modified passenger-to-freighter model. The conversion work was performed in Singapore by <a href="ST%20Aerospace%23Subsidiaries/Divisions">ST Aerospace Services</a>, the first supplier to offer a 767-300BCF program, and involved the addition of a main deck cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and additional freight monitoring and safety equipment. Since then, Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Wagner Aeronautical have also offered passenger-to-freighter conversion programs for 767-300 series aircraft.

The 767-400ER, the first Boeing wide-body jet resulting from two fuselage stretches, entered service with Continental Airlines in 2000. The type features a stretch over the 767-300, for a total length of . The wingspan is also increased by through the addition of <a href="raked%20wingtips">raked wingtips</a>. Other differences include an updated cockpit, redesigned landing gear, and 777-style Signature Interior. Power is provided by uprated Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or General Electric CF6 engines.

The FAA granted approval for the 767-400ER to operate 180-minute <a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a> flights before it entered service. Because its fuel capacity was not increased over preceding models, the 767-400ER has a range of , less than previous extended-range 767s. This is roughly the distance from Shenzhen to Seattle. No 767-400 version was developed, while a longer-range version, the 767-400ERX, was offered for sale in 2000 before it was cancelled a year later, leaving the 767-400ER as the sole version of the largest 767. Boeing dropped the 767-400ER and the -200ER from its pricing list in 2014. A total of 37 aircraft were delivered to the variant's two airline customers, <a href="Continental%20Airlines">Continental Airlines</a> (now merged with <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a>) and <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, with no unfilled orders. All 37 examples of the -400ER were in service in July 2016. One additional example was produced as a military testbed, and later sold as a VIP transport. The type's closest competitor is the Airbus A330-200.

Versions of the 767 serve in a number of military and government applications, with responsibilities ranging from airborne surveillance and refueling to cargo and VIP transport. Several military 767s have been derived from the 767-200ER, the longest-range version of the aircraft.


Boeing offered the 767-400ERX, a longer-range version of the largest 767 model, in 2000. Introduced concurrently with the <a href="Boeing%20747-8%23Background">747X</a>, the type was to be powered by the 747X's engines, the <a href="Engine%20Alliance%20GP7000">Engine Alliance GP7000</a> and the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Trent">Rolls-Royce Trent 600</a>. An increased range of was specified. <a href="Kenya%20Airways">Kenya Airways</a> provisionally ordered three 767-400ERXs to supplement its 767 fleet, but after Boeing cancelled the type's development in 2001, switched the order to the 777-200ER.

The <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20E-10%20MC2A">Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A</a> was to be a 767-400ER-based replacement for the USAF's 707-based E-3 Sentry AWACS, <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20E-8%20Joint%20STARS">Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS</a>, and <a href="Boeing%20RC-135">RC-135</a> <a href="SIGINT">SIGINT</a> aircraft. The E-10 MC2A would have included an all-new AWACS system, with a powerful <a href="active%20electronically%20scanned%20array">active electronically scanned array</a> (AESA) that was also capable of jamming enemy aircraft or missiles. One 767-400ER aircraft was produced as a testbed for systems integration, but the program was terminated in January 2009 and the prototype was sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport.

In July 2016, 742 aircraft were in airline service: 76 -200s, 629 -300 and 37 -400 with 77 -300 on order; the largest operators are <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> (91), <a href="UPS%20Airlines">UPS Airlines</a> (59 - largest cargo operator), <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> (51), <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> (40), <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a> (40), <a href="All%20Nippon%20Airways">All Nippon Airways</a> (37).

The largest customers are Delta Air Lines with 117 orders, <a href="FedEx">FedEx</a> (108), All Nippon Airways (96), and United Airlines (82). Delta and United are the only customers of all -200, -300 and -400 passenger variants. In July 2015, FedEx placed a firm order for 50 Boeing 767 freighters with deliveries from 2018 to 2023.



As of May 2017, the Boeing 767 has been in 45 <a href="Aviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents">aviation occurrences</a>, including 16 <a href="Hull%20loss">hull-loss</a> accidents. Six fatal crashes, including three <a href="Aircraft%20hijacking">hijackings</a>, have resulted in a total of 851 occupant fatalities. The airliner's first fatal crash, <a href="Lauda%20Air%20Flight%20004">Lauda Air Flight 004</a>, occurred near Bangkok on May 26, 1991, following the in-flight deployment of the left engine <a href="thrust%20reverser">thrust reverser</a> on a 767-300ER; none of the 223 aboard survived; as a result of this accident all 767 thrust reversers were deactivated until a redesign was implemented. Investigators determined that an electronically controlled valve, common to late-model Boeing aircraft, was to blame. A new locking device was installed on all affected jetliners, including 767s. On October 31, 1999, <a href="EgyptAir%20Flight%20990">EgyptAir Flight 990</a>, a 767-300ER, crashed off <a href="Nantucket%20Island">Nantucket Island</a>, Massachusetts, in <a href="international%20waters">international waters</a> killing all 217 people on board. The US <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB) determined the probable cause to be due to a deliberate action by the first officer; Egypt disputed this conclusion. On April 15, 2002, <a href="Air%20China%20Flight%20129">Air China Flight 129</a>, a 767-200ER, <a href="controlled%20flight%20into%20terrain">crashed into a hill</a> amid inclement weather while trying to land at <a href="Gimhae%20International%20Airport">Gimhae International Airport</a> in Busan, South Korea. The crash resulted in the death of 129 of the 166 people on board, and the cause was attributed to <a href="pilot%20error">pilot error</a>.
An early 767 incident was survived by all on board. On July 23, 1983, <a href="Gimli%20Glider">Air Canada Flight 143</a>, a 767-200, ran out of fuel in-flight and had to glide with both engines out for almost to an emergency landing at <a href="Gimli%2C%20Manitoba">Gimli, Manitoba</a>. The pilots used the aircraft's <a href="ram%20air%20turbine">ram air turbine</a> to power the <a href="hydraulic">hydraulic</a> systems for aerodynamic control. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. This aircraft was nicknamed "Gimli Glider" after its landing site. The aircraft, registered C-GAUN, continued flying for <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a> until its retirement in January 2008.

The 767 has been involved in six hijackings, three resulting in loss of life, for a combined total of 282 occupant fatalities. On November 23, 1996, <a href="Ethiopian%20Airlines%20Flight%20961">Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961</a>, a 767-200ER, was hijacked and crash-landed in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> near the <a href="Comoros%20Islands">Comoros Islands</a> after running out of fuel, killing 125 out of the 175 persons on board; survivors have been rare among instances of land-based aircraft ditching on water. Two 767s were involved in the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> on the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a> in 2001, resulting in the collapse of its two main towers. <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%2011">American Airlines Flight 11</a>, a 767-200ER, crashed into the north tower, killing all 92 people on board, and <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%20175">United Airlines Flight 175</a>, a 767-200, crashed into the south tower, with the death of all 65 on board. In addition, more than 2,600 people were killed in the towers or on the ground. A foiled <a href="2001%20shoe%20bomb%20plot">2001 shoe bomb plot</a> involving an American Airlines 767-300ER resulted in passengers being required to remove their shoes for scanning at US security checkpoints.

On November 1, 2011, <a href="LOT%20Polish%20Airlines%20Flight%2016">LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16</a>, a 767-300ER, safely landed at <a href="Warsaw%20Frederic%20Chopin%20Airport">Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport</a> in Warsaw, Poland after a mechanical failure of the landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At the time of the incident, aviation analysts speculated that it may have been the first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated <a href="circuit%20breaker">circuit breaker</a>.

In January 2014, the US <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> issued a directive that ordered inspections of the elevators on more than 400 767s beginning in March 2014; the focus is on <a href="fastener">fastener</a>s and other parts that can fail and cause the elevators to jam. The issue was first identified in 2000 and has been the subject of several Boeing service bulletins. The inspections and repairs are required to be completed within six years. The aircraft has also had multiple occurrences of "uncommanded escape slide inflation" during maintenance or operations, and during flight. In late 2015, the FAA issued a preliminary directive to address the issue.

On October 28, 2016, <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%20383%20%282016%29">American Airlines Flight 383</a>, a 767-300ER with 161 passengers and 9 crew members, aborted takeoff at Chicago O'Hare Airport following an <a href="Turbine%20engine%20failure%23Contained%20and%20uncontained%20failures">uncontained failure</a> of the right GE CF6-80C2 engine. The engine failure, which hurled fragments over a considerable distance, caused a fuel leak resulting in a fire under the right wing. Fire and smoke entered the cabin. All passengers and crew evacuated the aircraft, with 20 passengers and one flight attendant sustaining minor injuries using the evacuation slides. 
As new 767s roll off the assembly line, older models have been retired and scrapped. One complete aircraft is known to have been retained for exhibition: N102DA, the first 767-200 to operate for Delta Air Lines and the twelfth example built. The exhibition aircraft, named "The Spirit of Delta" by the employees who helped purchase it in 1982, underwent restoration at the <a href="Delta%20Heritage%20Museum">Delta Air Lines Air Transport Heritage Museum</a> in Atlanta, Georgia. The restoration was completed in 2010.

Bill Walsh (American football coach)

William Ernest Walsh (November 30, 1931 – July 30, 2007) was an American football coach. He served as head coach of the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> and the <a href="Stanford%20Cardinal%20football">Stanford Cardinal football team</a>, during which time he popularized the <a href="West%20Coast%20offense">West Coast offense</a>. After retiring from the 49ers, Walsh worked as a sports broadcaster for several years and then returned as head coach at Stanford for three seasons.

Walsh went 102–63–1 with the 49ers, winning 10 of his 14 postseason games along with six division titles, three <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship</a> titles, and three <a href="Super%20Bowls">Super Bowls</a>. He was named NFL Coach of the Year in 1981 and 1984. In 1993, he was elected to the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>.

Born in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Walsh played running back in the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a> for <a href="Hayward%20High%20School">Hayward High School</a> in <a href="Hayward%2C%20California">Hayward</a>.
Walsh played <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> at the <a href="College%20of%20San%20Mateo">College of San Mateo</a> for two seasons. Both <a href="John%20Madden">John Madden</a> and Walsh played and coached at the College of San Mateo early in their careers. After playing at the College of San Mateo, Walsh transferred to <a href="San%20Jose%20State%20University">San Jose State University</a>, where he played <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a> and <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a>. He also participated in intercollegiate <a href="boxing">boxing</a>. Walsh graduated from San Jose State with a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a> in <a href="physical%20education">physical education</a> in 1955.

He served under Bob Bronzan as a graduate assistant coach on the <a href="San%20Jos%C3%A9%20State%20Spartans">Spartans</a> football coaching staff and graduated with a <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's degree</a> in physical education from San Jose State in 1959. His master's <a href="thesis">thesis</a> was entitled "Flank Formation Football -- Stress:: Defense". Thesis 796.W228f.

Following graduation, Walsh coached the football and swim teams at <a href="Washington%20High%20School%20%28Fremont%2C%20California%29">Washington High School</a> in <a href="Fremont%2C%20California">Fremont, California</a>.

Walsh was coaching in Fremont when he interviewed for an assistant coaching position with <a href="Marv%20Levy">Marv Levy</a>, who had just been hired as the head coach at the <a href="California%20Golden%20Bears%20football">University of California, Berkeley</a>.
"I was very impressed, individually, by his knowledge, by his intelligence, by his personality, and hired him," Levy said. Levy and Walsh, two future NFL Hall of Famers, would never produce a winning season at <a href="California%20Golden%20Bears%20football">Cal</a>.

After coaching at Cal, Walsh did a stint at <a href="Stanford%20Cardinal%20football">Stanford</a> as an assistant coach, before beginning his pro coaching career.

Walsh began his pro coaching career in <a href="1966%20AFL%20season">1966</a> as an assistant with the <a href="American%20Football%20League">AFL</a>'s <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>. As a Raider assistant, Walsh was trained in the vertical passing offense favored by <a href="Al%20Davis">Al Davis</a>, putting Walsh in Davis's mentor <a href="Sid%20Gillman%23Coaching%20tree">Sid Gillman's coaching tree</a>.

In 1967 Walsh was the head coach and general manager of the <a href="San%20Jose%20Apaches">San Jose Apaches</a> of the <a href="Continental%20Football%20League">Continental Football League</a> (CFL). Walsh led the Apaches to 2nd place in the Pacific Division. Prior to the start of the 1968 CFL season the Apaches ceased all football operations.

In <a href="1968%20AFL%20season">1968</a>, Walsh moved to the AFL expansion <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, joining the staff of legendary coach <a href="Paul%20Brown">Paul Brown</a>. It was there that Walsh developed the philosophy now known as the "West Coast Offense", as a matter of necessity. Cincinnati's new <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a>, <a href="Virgil%20Carter">Virgil Carter</a>, was known for his great mobility and accuracy but lacked a strong arm necessary to throw deep passes. Thus, Walsh modified the vertical passing scheme he had learned during his time with the Raiders, designing a horizontal passing system that relied on quick, short throws - often spreading the ball across the entire width of the field. The new offense was much better suited to Carter's physical abilities; he led the league in pass completion percentage in 1971.

Walsh spent eight seasons as an assistant with the Bengals. <a href="Ken%20Anderson%20%28quarterback%29">Ken Anderson</a> eventually replaced Carter as starting quarterback, and together with star <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> <a href="Isaac%20Curtis">Isaac Curtis</a>, produced a consistent, effective offensive attack. Initially, Walsh started out as the wide receivers coach from 1968 to 1970 before also coaching the quarterbacks from 1971 to 1975.

When Brown retired as head coach following the <a href="1975%20NFL%20season">1975</a> season and appointed <a href="Bill%20%26quot%3BTiger%26quot%3B%20Johnson">Bill "Tiger" Johnson</a> as his successor, Walsh resigned and served as an assistant coach for <a href="Tommy%20Prothro">Tommy Prothro</a> with the <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a> in <a href="1976%20NFL%20season">1976</a>. In a 2006 interview, Walsh claimed that during his tenure with the Bengals, Brown "worked against my candidacy" to be a head coach anywhere in the league. "All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them," Walsh said. "And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep me out of the NFL."

In 1977, Walsh was hired as the head coach at <a href="Stanford%20Cardinal%20football">Stanford</a> where he stayed for two seasons. His two Stanford teams were successful, posting a 9–3 record in 1977 with a win in the <a href="1977%20Sun%20Bowl%20%28December%29">Sun Bowl</a>, and 8–4 in 1978 with a win in the <a href="1978%20Bluebonnet%20Bowl">Bluebonnet Bowl</a>. His notable players at Stanford included quarterbacks <a href="Guy%20Benjamin">Guy Benjamin</a> and <a href="Steve%20Dils">Steve Dils</a>, wide receivers <a href="James%20Lofton">James Lofton</a> and <a href="Ken%20Margerum">Ken Margerum</a>, linebacker <a href="Gordy%20Ceresino">Gordy Ceresino</a>, in addition to running back <a href="Darrin%20Nelson">Darrin Nelson</a>. Walsh was the <a href="Pacific-10%20Conference">Pac-8 Conference</a> Coach of the Year in 1977.

In <a href="1979%20NFL%20season">1979</a>, Walsh was hired as head coach of the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> by owner <a href="Edward%20J.%20DeBartolo%2C%20Jr.">Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.</a> The long-suffering 49ers went 2–14 in <a href="1978%20NFL%20Season">1978</a>, the season before Walsh's arrival and repeated the same dismal record in his first season. But, Walsh got the entire organization to buy into his philosophy and vowed to turn around a miserable situation. He also drafted quarterback <a href="Joe%20Montana">Joe Montana</a> from <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">Notre Dame</a> in the third round. Despite their second consecutive 2-14 record, the 49ers were playing more competitive football.

In <a href="1980%20NFL%20Season">1980</a>, <a href="Steve%20DeBerg">Steve DeBerg</a> was the starting quarterback who got San Francisco off to a 3-0 start, but after a 59-14 blowout loss to Dallas in week 6, Walsh promoted Montana to starting QB. In a Sunday game, December 7 vs. the New Orleans Saints, Montana brought the 49ers back from a 35-7 halftime deficit to win 38-35 in overtime. The 49ers improved to 6–10, but more importantly, Walsh had them making great strides and they were getting better every week.

In <a href="1981%20NFL%20season">1981</a>, four important wins were two wins each over the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a> and the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>. The Rams were only one year removed from a <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XIV">Super Bowl</a> appearance, and had dominated the series with the 49ers since 1967 winning 23, losing 3 and tying 1. San Francisco's two wins over the Rams in 1981 marked the shift of dominance in favor of the 49ers that lasted until 1998 with 30 wins (including 17 consecutively) against only 6 defeats. The 49ers blew out the Cowboys in week 6 of the regular season. On "<a href="Monday%20Night%20Football">Monday Night Football</a>" that week, the win was not included in the halftime highlights. Walsh felt that this was because the Cowboys were scheduled to play the Rams the next week in a Sunday night game and that showing the highlights of the 49ers' win would potentially hurt the game's ratings. However, Walsh used this as a motivating factor for his team, who felt they were disrespected.

The 49ers faced the Cowboys again that same season in the <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">NFC</a> title game. The game was very close, and in the fourth quarter Walsh called a series of running plays as the 49ers marched down the field against the Cowboys' prevent defense, which had been expecting the 49ers to mainly pass. The 49ers came from behind to win the game on Dwight Clark's touchdown reception, known as <a href="The%20Catch%20%28American%20football%29">The Catch</a>, propelling Walsh to his first Super Bowl. Walsh would later write that the 49ers' two wins over the Rams showed a shift of power in their division, while the wins over the Cowboys showed a shift of power in the conference.

San Francisco won its first championship just two years after winning only two games. The 49ers won <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XVI">Super Bowl XVI</a> defeating the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> 26-21 in <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac, Michigan</a>. Under Walsh the team rose from the cellar to the top of the NFL in just two seasons.

The 49ers won <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> championships in <a href="1981%20NFL%20season">1981</a>, <a href="1984%20NFL%20season">1984</a> and <a href="1988%20NFL%20season">1988</a>. Walsh served as 49ers head coach for ten years, and during his tenure he and his coaching staff perfected the style of play known popularly as the <a href="West%20Coast%20offense">West Coast offense</a>. Walsh was nicknamed "The Genius" for both his innovative play calling and design. Walsh would regularly script the first 10-15 offensive plays before the start of each game. In the ten years during which Walsh was the 49ers' head coach, San Francisco scored 3,714 points (24.4 per game), the most of any team in the league during that span.

In addition to <a href="Joe%20Montana">Joe Montana</a>, Walsh drafted <a href="Ronnie%20Lott">Ronnie Lott</a>, <a href="Charles%20Haley">Charles Haley</a>, and <a href="Jerry%20Rice">Jerry Rice</a>. He also traded a 2nd and 4th round pick in the 1987 draft for <a href="Steve%20Young%20%28American%20football%29">Steve Young</a>. His success with the 49ers was rewarded with his election to the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Professional Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1993. Montana, Lott, Haley, Rice and Young were also elected to the Hall of Fame.

Many of Bill Walsh's assistant coaches went on to be head coaches themselves, including <a href="George%20Seifert">George Seifert</a>, <a href="Mike%20Holmgren">Mike Holmgren</a>, <a href="Ray%20Rhodes">Ray Rhodes</a>, and <a href="Dennis%20Green">Dennis Green</a>. After Walsh's retirement from the 49ers, Seifert succeeded him as 49ers head coach, and guided San Francisco to victories in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXIV">Super Bowl XXIV</a> and <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXIX">Super Bowl XXIX</a>. Holmgren won a <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXI">Super Bowl</a> with the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>, and made 3 Super Bowl appearances as a head coach: 2 with the Packers, and another with the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a>. These coaches in turn have their own disciples who have used Walsh's West Coast system, such as former <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> head coach <a href="Mike%20Shanahan">Mike Shanahan</a> and former <a href="Houston%20Texans">Houston Texans</a> head coach <a href="Gary%20Kubiak">Gary Kubiak</a>. Mike Shanahan was an offensive coordinator under <a href="George%20Seifert">George Seifert</a> and went on to win <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXII">Super Bowl XXXII</a> and <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXIII">Super Bowl XXXIII</a> during his time as head coach of the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>. Kubiak was first a <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> coach with the 49ers, then <a href="offensive%20coordinator">offensive coordinator</a> for Shanahan with the Broncos. In 2015, he became head coach and led Denver to victory in <a href="Super%20Bowl%2050">Super Bowl 50</a>. <a href="Dennis%20Green">Dennis Green</a> trained <a href="Tony%20Dungy">Tony Dungy</a>, who won a <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLI">Super Bowl</a> with the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Billick">Brian Billick</a> with his brother-in law and linebackers coach <a href="Mike%20Smith%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Mike Smith</a>. Billick won a <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXV">Super Bowl</a> as head coach of the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>. Mike Holmgren trained many of his assistants to become head coaches, including <a href="Jon%20Gruden">Jon Gruden</a> and <a href="Andy%20Reid">Andy Reid</a>. Gruden won a <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXVII">Super Bowl</a> with the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. Reid served as head coach of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> from 1999-2012, and guided the Eagles to multiple winning seasons and numerous playoff appearances. In addition to this, <a href="Marc%20Trestman">Marc Trestman</a>, former head coach of the <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a>, served as Offensive Coordinator under Seifert in the 90's. Gruden himself would train <a href="Mike%20Tomlin">Mike Tomlin</a>, who led the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> to their <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLIII">sixth Super Bowl championship</a>, and <a href="Jim%20Harbaugh">Jim Harbaugh</a>, whose 49ers would face his brother, <a href="John%20Harbaugh">John Harbaugh</a>, whom Reid himself trained, and the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> at <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVII">Super Bowl XLVII</a>, which marked the Ravens' second World Championship.

Bill Walsh was viewed as a strong advocate for African-American head coaches in the NFL and NCAA. Thus, the impact of Walsh also changed the NFL into an equal opportunity for African-American coaches. Along with <a href="Ray%20Rhodes">Ray Rhodes</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Green">Dennis Green</a>, <a href="Tyrone%20Willingham">Tyrone Willingham</a> became the head coach at Stanford, then later <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">Notre Dame</a> and Washington. One of <a href="Mike%20Shanahan">Mike Shanahan</a>'s assistants, <a href="Karl%20Dorrell">Karl Dorrell</a> went on to be the head coach at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a>. Walsh directly helped propel Dennis Green into the NFL head coaching ranks by offering to take on the head coaching job at Stanford.

Many former and current NFL head coaches trace their lineage back to Bill Walsh on his <a href="coaching%20tree">coaching tree</a>, shown below. Walsh, in turn, belonged to the coaching tree of <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> great and Hall of Fame coach <a href="Sid%20Gillman">Sid Gillman</a> of the AFL's <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers</a> and Hall of Fame coach <a href="Paul%20Brown">Paul Brown</a>.
After leaving the coaching ranks immediately following his team's victory in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXIII">Super Bowl XXIII</a>, Walsh went to work as a broadcaster for <a href="NFL%20on%20NBC">NBC</a>, teaming with <a href="Dick%20Enberg">Dick Enberg</a> to form the lead broadcasting team, replacing <a href="Merlin%20Olsen">Merlin Olsen</a>.

Walsh returned to Stanford as head coach in 1992, leading the Cardinal to a 10–3 record and a <a href="Pacific-10%20Conference">Pacific-10 Conference</a> co-championship. Stanford finished the season with an upset victory over <a href="Penn%20State">Penn State</a> in the <a href="1993%20Blockbuster%20Bowl">Blockbuster Bowl</a> on January 1, 1993 and a #9 ranking in the final <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a>. In 1994, after consecutive losing seasons, Walsh left Stanford and retired from coaching.

In 1996 Walsh returned to the 49ers as an administrative aide Walsh was the Vice President and General Manager for the 49ers from <a href="1999%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season">1999</a> to <a href="2001%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season">2001</a> and was a special consultant to the team for three years afterwards.

In 2004, Walsh was appointed as special assistant to the athletic director at Stanford. In 2005, after then-athletic director Ted Leland stepped down, Walsh was named interim athletic director. He also acted as a consultant for his alma mater <a href="San%20Jose%20State%20University">San Jose State University</a> in their search for an Athletic Director and Head Football Coach in 2005.

Utility knife

A utility knife is a knife used for general or utility purposes. The utility knife was originally a fixed blade knife with a cutting edge suitable for general work such as cutting hides and cordage, scraping hides, butchering animals, cleaning fish, and other tasks. Craft knives are tools mostly used for crafts. Today, the term "utility knife" also includes small folding or retractable-blade knives suited for use in the modern workplace or in the construction industry.

There is also a <a href="Kitchen%20knife%23Utility">utility knife for kitchen use</a> which is between a chef's knife and paring knife in size.

The fixed-blade utility knife was developed some 500,000 years ago, when human ancestors began to make knives made of stone. These knives were general-purpose tools, designed for cutting and shaping wooden implements, scraping hides, preparing food, and for other utilitarian purposes.

By the 19th century the fixed-blade utility knife had evolved into a steel-bladed outdoors field knife capable of butchering game, cutting wood, and preparing campfires and meals. With the invention of the backspring, pocket-size utility knives were introduced with folding blades and other folding tools designed to increase the utility of the overall design. The folding pocketknife and utility tool is typified by the "Camper" or "Boy Scout" pocketknife, the U.S. folding utility knife, the <a href="Swiss%20Army%20Knife">Swiss Army Knife</a>, and by <a href="multi-tool">multi-tool</a>s fitted with knife blades. The development of stronger locking blade mechanisms for folding knives—as with the Spanish <a href="navaja">navaja</a>, the <a href="Opinel">Opinel</a>, and the <a href="Buck%20Knives">Buck 110 Folding Hunter</a>—significantly increased the utility of such knives when employed for heavy-duty tasks such as preparing game or cutting through dense or tough materials.

The fixed or folding blade utility knife is popular for both indoor and outdoor use. One of the most popular types of workplace utility knife is the retractable or folding utility knife (also known as a "Stanley knife", "box cutter", "X-Acto knife", or by various other <a href="%23Names">names</a>). These types of utility knives are designed as multi-purpose cutting <a href="tool">tool</a>s for use in a variety of trades and crafts. Designed to be lightweight and easy to carry and use, utility knives are commonly used in <a href="factory">factories</a>, warehouses, construction projects, and other situations where a tool is routinely needed to mark cut lines, trim plastic or wood materials, or to cut tape, cord, strapping, cardboard, or other packaging material.

In <a href="British%20English">British</a>, <a href="Australian%20English">Australian</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand%20English">New Zealand English</a>, along with <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> and <a href="Austrian%20German">Austrian German</a>, a utility knife frequently used in the construction industry is known as a "Stanley knife". This name is a <a href="genericised%20trademark">genericised trademark</a> named after <a href="Stanley%20Works">Stanley Works</a>, a manufacturer of such knives. In Israel and Switzerland, these knives are known as "Japanese knives". In Brazil they are known as "estiletes" or "cortadores <a href="Olfa">Olfa</a>" (the latter, being another genericised trademark). In Portugal and Canada they are also known as "<a href="X-Acto">X-Acto</a>" (yet another <a href="genericised%20trademark">genericised trademark</a>). In India, the Philippines, France, Italy, Egypt, and Germany, they are simply called "cutter". In the Flemish region of Belgium it is called "cuttermes(je)" (cutter knife). In general Spanish, they are known as "cortaplumas" (penknife, when it comes to folding blades); in Spain, Mexico, and Costa Rica, they are colloquially known as "cutters"; in Argentina and Uruguay the segmented fixed-blade knives are known as "Trinchetas". In Turkey, they are known as "maket bıçağı" (which literally translates as "model knife").

Other names for the tool are "box cutter" or "boxcutter", "razor blade knife", "razor knife", "carpet knife", "pen knife", "stationery knife", "sheetrock knife", or "drywall knife".

Utility knives may use fixed, folding, or retractable or replaceable blades, and come in a wide variety of lengths and styles suited to the particular set of tasks they are designed to perform. Thus, an outdoors utility knife suited for camping or hunting might use a broad fixed blade, while a utility knife designed for the construction industry might feature a replaceable utility or razor blade for cutting packaging, cutting shingles, marking cut lines, or scraping paint.

Large fixed-blade utility knives are most often employed in an outdoors context, such as fishing, camping, or hunting. Outdoor utility knives typically feature sturdy blades from in length, with edge geometry designed to resist chipping and breakage.

The term "utility knife" may also refer to small fixed-blade knives used for crafts, model-making and other artisanal projects. These small knives feature light-duty blades best suited for cutting thin, lightweight materials. The small, thin blade and specialized handle permit cuts requiring a high degree of precision and control.

The largest construction or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and replaceable blades, made of either <a href="die%20casting">die-cast metal</a> or <a href="molding%20%28process%29">molded plastic</a>. Some use standard <a href="razor">razor</a> blades, others specialized double-ended utility blades. The user can adjust how far the blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife can be used to cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package. When the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. Spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle. Other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade storage tray. The blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. Specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.
Another style is a snap-off utility knife that contains a long, segmented blade that slides out from it. As the endmost edge becomes dull, it can be broken off the remaining blade, exposing the next section, which is sharp and ready for use. The snapping is best accomplished with a blade snapper that is often built-in, or a pair of pliers, and the break occurs at the score lines, where the metal is thinnest. When all of the individual segments are used, the knife may be thrown away, or, more often, refilled with a replacement blade. This design was introduced by Japanese manufacturer <a href="Olfa">Olfa</a> Corporation in 1956 as the world's first snap-off blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments.
Another utility knife often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which <a href="Razor%23Other%20razors">single-edge utility blades</a> can be inserted. The sleeve slides up and down on the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use. The blade holder may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife. The blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of <a href="corrugated%20fiberboard">corrugated fiberboard</a>, to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.

Most utility knives are not well suited to use as offensive weapons, with the exception of some outdoor-type utility knives employing longer blades. However, even small razor-blade type utility knives may sometimes find use as slashing weapons. The <a href="9/11%20Commission">9-11 commission</a> report stated passengers in cell phone calls reported knives or "box-cutters" were used as weapons, (also Mace or a bomb), in hi-jacking airplanes in the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks</a> against the United States, though the exact design of the knives used is unknown. Two of the hijackers were known to have purchased <a href="Leatherman">Leatherman</a> knives, which feature a 4" locking blade which were not prohibited on U.S. flights at the time. Those knives were not found in the possessions the two hijackers left behind. Similar cutters, including <a href="paper%20cutters">paper cutters</a>, have also been known to be used as a lethal weapon.

Small work-type utility knives have also been used to commit robbery and other crimes. In June 2004, a Japanese <a href="Sasebo%20slashing">student was slashed to death</a> with a segmented-type utility knife.

In the United Kingdom, the law was changed to raise the age limit for purchasing knives, including utility knives, from 16 to 18.

Bronze

Bronze is an <a href="alloy">alloy</a> consisting primarily of <a href="copper">copper</a>, commonly with about 12% <a href="tin">tin</a> and often with the addition of other metals (such as <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a> or <a href="zinc">zinc</a>) and sometimes non-metals or <a href="metalloids">metalloids</a> such as <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> or <a href="silicon">silicon</a>. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as stiffness, <a href="ductility">ductility</a>, or machinability.

The archeological period where bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>. In the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a> this began with the rise of <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a> in the 4th millennium BC, with India and China starting to use bronze around the same time; everywhere it gradually spread across regions. The Bronze Age was followed by the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> starting from about 1300 BC and reaching most of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> by about 500 BC, though bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times.

Because historical pieces were often made of <a href="brass">brass</a>es (copper and zinc) and bronzes with different compositions, modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the more inclusive term "<a href="copper%20alloy">copper alloy</a>" instead.

The word "bronze" (1730–40) is borrowed from French "bronze" (1511), itself borrowed from Italian "bronzo" "bell metal, brass" (13th century) (transcribed in <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> as "bronzium") from either,

The discovery of bronze enabled people to create metal objects which were harder and more durable than previously possible. Bronze tools, weapons, armor, and <a href="building%20material">building material</a>s such as decorative tiles were harder and more durable than their stone and copper ("<a href="Chalcolithic">Chalcolithic</a>") predecessors. Initially, bronze was made out of copper and <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, forming <a href="arsenic%20bronze">arsenic bronze</a>, or from naturally or artificially mixed ores of copper and arsenic, with the earliest <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifacts</a> so far known coming from the <a href="Iranian%20plateau">Iranian plateau</a> in the 5th millennium BCE. It was only later that <a href="tin">tin</a> was used, becoming the major non-copper ingredient of bronze in the late 3rd millennium BC.

Tin bronze was superior to arsenic bronze in that the alloying process could be more easily controlled, and the resulting alloy was stronger and easier to cast. Also, <a href="Arsenic%20poisoning">unlike arsenic</a>, metallic tin and fumes from tin refining are <a href="Tin%20poisoning">not toxic</a>. The earliest tin-alloy bronze dates to 4500 BCE in a <a href="Vin%C4%8Da%20culture">Vinča culture</a> site in <a href="Plo%C4%8Dnik%20%28archaeological%20site%29">Pločnik</a> (<a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>). Other early examples date to the late 4th millennium BC in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Susa">Susa</a> (<a href="Iran">Iran</a>) and some ancient sites in China, <a href="Luristan">Luristan</a> (Iran) and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (<a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>).

<a href="Ore">Ore</a>s of copper and the far rarer tin are not often found together (exceptions include one ancient site in <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> and one in Iran), so serious bronze work has always involved trade. <a href="Tin%20sources%20and%20trade%20in%20ancient%20times">Tin sources and trade in ancient times</a> had a major influence on the development of cultures. In Europe, a major source of tin was the British deposits of ore in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, which were traded as far as <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a> in the Eastern <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>.

In many parts of the world, large hoards of bronze artifacts are found, suggesting that bronze also represented a store of value and an indicator of social status. In Europe, large hoards of bronze tools, typically socketed axes (illustrated above), are found, which mostly show no signs of wear. With <a href="Chinese%20ritual%20bronze">Chinese ritual bronze</a>s, which are documented in the inscriptions they carry and from other sources, the case is very clear. These were made in enormous quantities for elite burials, and also used by the living for ritual offerings.

Though bronze is generally harder than <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a>, with <a href="Vickers%20hardness%20test">Vickers hardness</a> of 60–258 vs. 30–80, the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> gave way to the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> after a serious disruption of the tin trade: the population migrations of around 1200–1100 BC reduced the shipping of tin around the Mediterranean and from Britain, limiting supplies and raising prices. As the art of working in iron improved, iron became cheaper and improved in quality. As cultures advanced from hand-wrought iron to machine-forged iron (typically made with <a href="trip%20hammer">trip hammer</a>s powered by water), blacksmiths learned how to make <a href="steel">steel</a>. Steel is stronger than bronze and holds a sharper edge longer.

Bronze was still used during the Iron Age, and has continued in use for many purposes to the modern day.

There are many different bronze alloys, but typically modern bronze is 88% <a href="copper">copper</a> and 12% <a href="tin">tin</a>. Alpha bronze consists of the alpha <a href="solid%20solution">solid solution</a> of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4–5% tin are used to make <a href="coin">coin</a>s, <a href="spring%20%28device%29">springs</a>, <a href="turbine">turbine</a>s and <a href="blade">blade</a>s. Historical "bronzes" are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English <a href="Gloucester%20Candlestick">Gloucester Candlestick</a> is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver – between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture suggests that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins. The <a href="Benin%20Bronzes">Benin Bronzes</a> are really brass, and the <a href="Romanesque%20art">Romanesque</a> <a href="Baptismal%20font%20at%20St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Church%2C%20Li%C3%A8ge">Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège</a> is described as both bronze and brass.

In the Bronze Age, two forms of bronze were commonly used: "classic bronze", about 10% tin, was used in casting; and "mild bronze", about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were mostly cast from classic bronze, while helmets and armor were hammered from mild bronze.

Commercial bronze (90% copper and 10% zinc) and architectural bronze (57% copper, 3% <a href="lead">lead</a>, 40% zinc) are more properly regarded as <a href="brass">brass</a> alloys because they contain <a href="zinc">zinc</a> as the main alloying ingredient. They are commonly used in architectural applications.

<a href="Bismuth%20bronze">Bismuth bronze</a> is a bronze alloy with a composition of 52% copper, 30% nickel, 12% zinc, 5% lead, and 1% bismuth. It is able to hold a good polish and so is sometimes used in light reflectors and mirrors.

Plastic bronze is bronze containing a significant quantity of lead which makes for improved plasticity possibly used by the ancient Greeks in their ship construction.

Silicon bronze has a composition of Si: 2.80–3.80%, Mn: 0.50–1.30%, Fe: 0.80% max., Zn: 1.50% max., Pb: 0.05% max., Cu: balance.

Other bronze alloys include <a href="aluminium%20bronze">aluminium bronze</a>, <a href="phosphor%20bronze">phosphor bronze</a>, manganese bronze, <a href="bell%20metal">bell metal</a>, <a href="arsenical%20bronze">arsenical bronze</a>, <a href="speculum%20metal">speculum metal</a> and <a href="cymbal%20alloys">cymbal alloys</a>.

Bronzes are typically very ductile alloys. By way of comparison, most bronzes are considerably less <a href="brittle">brittle</a> than cast iron. Typically bronze only oxidizes superficially; once a copper oxide (eventually becoming copper carbonate) layer is formed, the underlying metal is <a href="Passivation%20%28chemistry%29">protected from further corrosion</a>. However, if copper chlorides are formed, a corrosion-mode called "<a href="bronze%20disease">bronze disease</a>" will eventually completely destroy it. Copper-based <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s have lower <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a>s than steel or iron and are more readily produced from their constituent metals. They are generally about 10 percent denser than steel, although alloys using <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> or <a href="silicon">silicon</a> may be slightly less dense. Bronze is a better conductor of heat and electricity than most steels. The cost of copper-base alloys is generally higher than that of steels but lower than that of <a href="nickel">nickel</a>-base alloys.

Copper and its alloys have a huge variety of uses that reflect their versatile physical, mechanical, and <a href="Chemical%20property">chemical properties</a>. Some common examples are the high <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electrical conductivity</a> of pure copper, low-friction properties of bearing bronze (bronze which has a high lead content— 6–8%), resonant qualities of bell bronze (20% tin, 80% copper), and resistance to corrosion by <a href="seawater">seawater</a> of several bronze alloys.

The melting point of bronze varies depending on the ratio of the alloy components and is about . Bronze is usually nonmagnetic, but certain alloys containing iron or nickel may have magnetic properties.

Bronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period. Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.

In the 20th century, <a href="silicon">silicon</a> was introduced as the primary alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary <a href="statuary">statuary</a>. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze brazing rod, which allows colour-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminium is also used for the structural metal <a href="aluminium%20bronze">aluminium bronze</a>.

It is also widely used for casting <a href="bronze%20sculpture">bronze sculpture</a>s. Many common bronze alloys have the unusual and very desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling in the finest details of a <a href="molding%20%28process%29">mould</a>. Bronze parts are <a href="Toughness">tough</a> and typically used for <a href="Bearing%20%28mechanical%29">bearings</a>, clips, <a href="electrical%20connector">electrical connector</a>s and <a href="Spring%20%28device%29">springs</a>.

Bronze also has very low <a href="friction">friction</a> against dissimilar metals, making it important for <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s prior to modern <a href="Engineering%20tolerance">tolerancing</a>, where iron cannonballs would otherwise stick in the barrel. It is still widely used today for springs, bearings, bushings, automobile transmission pilot bearings, and similar fittings, and is particularly common in the bearings of small <a href="electric%20motor">electric motor</a>s. <a href="Phosphor%20bronze">Phosphor bronze</a> is particularly suited to precision-grade bearings and springs. It is also used in guitar and piano strings.

Unlike steel, bronze struck against a hard surface will not generate sparks, so it (along with <a href="beryllium%20copper">beryllium copper</a>) is used to make <a href="hammer">hammer</a>s, <a href="mallet">mallet</a>s, <a href="wrench">wrench</a>es and other durable tools to be used in explosive atmospheres or in the presence of flammable vapors. Bronze is used to make <a href="bronze%20wool">bronze wool</a> for woodworking applications where <a href="steel%20wool">steel wool</a> would discolour <a href="oak">oak</a>.

Various kinds of bronze are used in many different industrial applications.

<a href="Phosphor%20bronze">Phosphor bronze</a> is used for ships' propellers, musical instruments, and electrical contacts. <a href="Plain%20bearing%23Bronze">Bearings</a> are often made of bronze for its friction properties. It can be filled with oil to make the proprietary <a href="Oilite">Oilite</a> and similar material for bearings. <a href="Aluminium%20bronze">Aluminium bronze</a> is very hard and is used for bearings and machine tool ways.

The <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n king <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> (704–681 BC) claims to have been the first to cast monumental bronze statues (of up to 30 tonnes) using two-part moulds instead of the lost-wax method.

Bronze statues were regarded as the highest form of sculpture in <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20art">Ancient Greek art</a>, though survivals are few, as bronze was a valuable material in short supply in the <a href="Late%20Antique">Late Antique</a> and medieval periods. Many of the most famous Greek bronze sculptures are known through Roman copies in marble, which were more likely to survive. 
In India, bronze sculptures from the <a href="Kushana">Kushana</a> (<a href="Chausa%20hoard">Chausa hoard</a>) and <a href="Gupta">Gupta</a> periods (<a href="Brahma%20from%20Mirpur-Khas">Brahma from Mirpur-Khas</a>, Akota Hoard, <a href="Sultanganj%20Buddha">Sultanganj Buddha</a>) and later periods (<a href="Hansi">Hansi</a> Hoard) have been found. Indian Hindu artisans from the period of the <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Chola empire</a> in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> used bronze to create intricate statues via the <a href="lost%20wax%20casting">lost wax casting</a> method with ornate detailing depicting the deities of <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. The art form survives to this day, with many silpis, craftsmen, working in the areas of <a href="Swamimalai">Swamimalai</a> and <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>.

In antiquity other cultures also produced works of <a href="High%20culture">high art</a> using bronze. For example: in Africa, the <a href="Benin%20Bronzes">bronze heads</a> of the <a href="Benin%20Empire">Kingdom of Benin</a>; in Europe, Grecian bronzes typically of figures from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>; in <a href="east%20Asia">east Asia</a>, <a href="Chinese%20ritual%20bronze">Chinese ritual bronze</a>s of the <a href="Shang%20dynasty">Shang</a> and <a href="Zhou%20dynasty">Zhou dynasty</a>—more often ceremonial vessels but including some figurine examples. Bronze sculptures, although known for their longevity, still undergo microbial degradation; such as from certain species of yeasts.

Bronze continues into modern times as one of the materials of choice for monumental statuary.

Before it became possible to produce glass with acceptably flat surfaces, bronze was a standard material for mirrors. The reflecting surface was typically made slightly convex so that the whole face could be seen in a small mirror. Bronze was used for this purpose in many parts of the world, probably based on independent discoveries.

Bronze mirrors survive from the <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (2040–1750 BCE). In Europe, the <a href="Etruscans">Etruscans</a> were making bronze mirrors in the sixth century BCE, and <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> mirrors followed the same pattern. Although other materials such as <a href="speculum%20metal">speculum metal</a> had come into use, bronze mirrors were still being made in Japan in the eighteenth century AD.

 
Bronze is the preferred metal for <a href="bell%20%28instrument%29">bell</a>s in the form of a high tin bronze alloy known colloquially as <a href="bell%20metal">bell metal</a>, which is about 23% tin.

Nearly all professional <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>s are made from bronze, which gives a desirable balance of durability and <a href="timbre">timbre</a>. Several types of bronze are used, commonly <a href="B20%20%28bronze%29">B20 bronze</a>, which is roughly 20% tin, 80% copper, with traces of silver, or the tougher B8 bronze which is made from 8% tin and 92% copper. As the tin content in a bell or cymbal rises, the timbre drops.

Bronze is also used for the windings of steel and nylon strings of various <a href="String%20instrument">stringed instruments</a> such as the <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a>, <a href="piano">piano</a>, <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, and <a href="guitar">guitar</a>. Bronze strings are commonly reserved on pianoforte for the lower pitch tones, as they possess a superior sustain quality to that of high-tensile steel.

Bronzes of various metallurgical properties are widely used in struck <a href="idiophones">idiophones</a> around the world, notably bells, singing bowls, gongs, cymbals, and other idiophones from <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. Examples include Tibetan <a href="singing%20bowls">singing bowls</a>, temple <a href="bell%20%28instrument%29">bell</a>s of many sizes and shapes, gongs, <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a> <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a>, and other bronze <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a>s. The earliest bronze archeological finds in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> date from 1–2 BCE, including flat plates probably suspended and struck by a wooden or bone mallet. Ancient bronze drums from Thailand and Vietnam date back 2,000 years. Bronze bells from Thailand and Cambodia date back to 3,600 BCE.

Some companies are now making <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a>s from <a href="phosphor%20bronze">phosphor bronze</a> (3.5 to 10% tin and up to 1% phosphorus content). Bell bronze is used to make the tone rings of many professional model banjos. The tone ring is a heavy (usually 3 lbs.) folded or arched metal ring attached to a thick wood rim, over which a skin, or most often, a plastic membrane (or head) is stretched – it is the bell bronze that gives the banjo a crisp powerful lower register and clear, bell-like treble register-especially in bluegrass music.

Bronze has also been used in coins; most “copper” coins are actually bronze, with about 4 percent tin and 1 percent zinc.

As with coins, bronze has been used in the manufacture of various types of <a href="medal">medal</a>s for centuries, and are known in contemporary times for being awarded for third place in sporting competitions and other events. The later usage was in part attributed to the choices of <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="silver">silver</a> and bronze to represent the first three <a href="Ages%20of%20Man">Ages of Man</a> in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>: the <a href="Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a>, when men lived among the gods; the <a href="Silver%20age">Silver age</a>, where youth lasted a hundred years; and the <a href="Greek%20Heroic%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, the era of heroes, and was first adopted at the <a href="1904%20Summer%20Olympics">1904 Summer Olympics</a>. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.

Benelux

The Benelux Union (; ) is a <a href="Political%20union">politico</a>-<a href="economic%20union">economic union</a> of three neighbouring states in western <a href="Europe">Europe</a>: <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>.

The name "Benelux" is formed from joining the first two or three letters of each country's name – Belgium Netherlands Luxembourg – and was first used to name the customs agreement that initiated the union (signed in 1944). It is now used more generally to refer to the geographic, economic and cultural grouping of the three countries.

In 1951, these countries joined <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, and <a href="Italy">Italy</a> to form the <a href="European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community">European Coal and Steel Community</a>, a predecessor of the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC) and today's <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU).

The main institutions of the Union are the Committee of Ministers, the <a href="Benelux%20Parliament">Benelux Parliament</a>, the Council of the Union and the Secretariat-General, while the <a href="Benelux%20Office%20for%20Intellectual%20Property">Benelux Office for Intellectual Property</a> and the <a href="Benelux%20Court%20of%20Justice">Benelux Court of Justice</a> cover the same territory but are not part of the Union.

The Benelux General Secretariat is located in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. It is the central administrative pillar of the Benelux Union. It handles the secretariat of the Committee of Ministers, the Council of Economic Union and the various committees and working parties.

A <a href="Benelux%20Parliament">Benelux Parliament</a> (originally referred to as an "Interparliamentary Consultative Council") was created in 1955. This <a href="International%20parliament">parliamentary assembly</a> is composed of 21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21 members of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the Luxembourg parliament.

In 1944, exiled representatives of the three countries signed the <a href="London%20Customs%20Convention">London Customs Convention</a>, the treaty that established the Benelux Customs Union. Ratified in 1947, the treaty was in force from 1948 until it was superseded by the Benelux Economic Union. The treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union ("Benelux Economische Unie/Union Économique Benelux") was signed on 3 February 1958 in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> and came into force on 1 November 1960 to promote the free movement of workers, <a href="Capital%20%28economics%29">capital</a>, <a href="Service%20%28economics%29">services</a>, and <a href="goods">goods</a> in the region. Under the Treaty the Union implies the co-operation of economic, financial and social policies.

The Benelux Union involves an intergovernmental co-operation.

The unification of the law of the three Benelux countries is mainly achieved by regulations of its Committee of Ministers, that only bind the three states, but are not directly applicable in their internal legal orders. They only become legally valid after having been incorporated into national law, with the exception of Belgium. The <a href="Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28Belgium%29">Belgian Court of Cassation</a> decided in 1971 that any self-executing treaties have priority over laws by the Belgian parliament.

The Treaty establishing the Benelux Union has provided the Committee of Ministers with the following legal instruments: decisions, conventions, recommendations and directives.

The Committee of Ministers can promulgate decisions in the fields for which it has competence - those fields are explicitly set down in the Union Treaty or the additional conventions. When the Committee of Ministers adopts a decision, it immediately becomes binding on the three governments. For a decision to be also applicable to the citizen, it must be transposed into national law.

The Union Treaty is not exhaustive. For this reason, Article 19 of the Treaty provides that the Committee of Ministers may conclude additional conventions. These therefore constitute extensions of the Union Treaty. They are submitted to the national parliaments for approval in keeping with the ratification procedure applied in each of the Member States. Thus there are a large number of Benelux conventions in a wide range of subject matters.

In 1965, the treaty establishing a Benelux Court of Justice was signed. It entered into force in 1974. The Court, composed of judges from the highest courts of the three States, has to guarantee the uniform interpretation of common legal rules. This <a href="international%20judicial%20institution">international judicial institution</a> is located in Brussels.

The Benelux is particularly active in the field of <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a>. The three countries established a Benelux Trademarks Office and a Benelux Designs Office, both situated in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>. In 2005, they concluded a treaty establishing a "<a href="Benelux%20Office%20for%20Intellectual%20Property">Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property</a>" which replaced both offices upon its entry into force on 1 September 2006. This Organisation is the official body for the registration of trademarks and designs in the Benelux. In addition, it offers the possibility to formally record the existence of ideas, concepts, designs, prototypes and the like.

In 2000, Belgium and the Netherlands jointly hosted the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">UEFA European Championship</a>. In June 2007, representatives of the three countries announced they would bid, as a single political entity, for the <a href="2018%20and%202022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20bids">2018 FIFA World Cup</a>.

The Treaty between the Benelux countries establishing the Benelux Economic Union was limited to a period of 50 years. During the following years, and even more so after the creation of the European Union, the Benelux cooperation focused on developing other fields of activity within a constantly changing international context.

At the end of the 50 years, the governments of the three Benelux countries decided to renew the agreement, taking into account the new aspects of the Benelux-cooperation – such as security – and the new <a href="federal%20government">federal government</a> structure of Belgium. The original establishing treaty, set to expire in 2010, was replaced by a new legal framework (called the Treaty revising the Treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union), which was signed on 17 June 2008.

The new treaty has no set time limit and the name of the "Benelux Economic Union" changed to "Benelux Union" to reflect the broad scope on the union. The main objectives of the treaty are the continuation and enlargement of the cooperation between the three member states within a larger European context. The renewed treaty explicitly foresees the possibility that the Benelux countries will cooperate with other European member States or with regional cooperation structures. The new Benelux cooperation focuses on three main topics: internal market and economic union, sustainability, justice and internal affairs. The number of structures in the renewed Treaty has been reduced and thus simplified. Five Benelux institutions remain: the Benelux Committee of Ministers, the Benelux Council, the Benelux Parliament, the Benelux Court of Justice, the Benelux Secretariat General. Beside these five institutions, the Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property is also present in this Treaty.

Boston Herald

The Boston Herald is an American <a href="daily%20newspaper">daily newspaper</a> whose primary market is <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> and its surrounding area. It was founded in 1846 and is one of the oldest daily newspapers in the United States. It has been awarded eight <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>s in its history, including four for editorial writing and three for <a href="photography">photography</a> before it was converted to <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> format in 1981. The "Herald" was named one of the "10 Newspapers That 'Do It Right' in 2012 by "<a href="Editor%20%26amp%3B%20Publisher">Editor & Publisher</a>".

The "Herald" history can be traced back through two lineages, the "<a href="Boston%20Daily%20Advertiser">Daily Advertiser</a>" and the old "Boston Herald", and two media moguls, <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> and <a href="Rupert%20Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>.

The original "Boston Herald" was founded in 1846 by a group of Boston printers jointly under the name of John A. French & Company. The paper was published as a single two-sided sheet, selling for one cent. Its first editor, <a href="William%20O.%20Eaton">William O. Eaton</a>, just 22 years old, said "The "Herald" will be independent in politics and religion; liberal, industrious, enterprising, critically concerned with literacy and dramatic matters, and diligent in its mission to report and analyze the news, local and global."

In 1847, the "Boston Herald" absorbed the Boston "American Eagle" and the Boston "Daily Times".

In October 1917, John H. Higgins, the publisher and treasurer of the Boston Herald bought out its next door neighbor "<a href="The%20Boston%20Journal">The Boston Journal</a>" and created "The Boston Herald and Boston Journal"

Even earlier than the "Herald", the weekly "American Traveler" was founded in 1825 as a bulletin for <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> listings.

The "Boston Evening Traveler" was founded in 1845. The " Boston Evening Traveler" was the successor to the weekly "American Traveler" and the semi-weekly "Boston Traveler". In 1912, the "Herald" acquired the "Traveler", continuing to publish both under their own names. For many years, the newspaper was controlled by many of the investors in United Shoe Machinery Co. After a newspaper strike in 1967, Herald-Traveler Corp. suspended the afternoon "Traveler" and absorbed the evening edition into the Herald to create the "Boston Herald Traveler."

The "Boston Daily Advertiser" was established in 1813 in Boston by <a href="Nathan%20Hale%20%28journalist%29">Nathan Hale</a>. The paper grew to prominence throughout the 19th century, taking over other Boston area papers. In 1832 The Advertiser took over control of "The Boston Patriot", and then in 1840 it took over and absorbed "The Boston Gazette". The paper was purchased by <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> in 1917. In 1920 the "Advertiser" was merged with "The Boston Record", initially the combined newspaper was called the "Boston Advertiser" however when the combined newspaper became an illustrated tabloid in 1921 it was renamed "The Boston American". Hearst Corp. continued using the name "Advertiser" for its Sunday paper until the early 1970s.

On September 3, 1884, "The Boston Evening Record" was started by the "Boston Advertiser" as a campaign newspaper. The "Record" was so popular that it was made a permanent publication.

In 1904, William Randolph Hearst began publishing his own newspaper in Boston called "The American". Hearst ultimately ended up purchasing the "Daily Advertiser" in 1917. By 1938, the "Daily Advertiser" had changed to the "Daily Record", and "The American" had become the "Sunday Advertiser". A third paper owned by Hearst, called the "Afternoon Record", which had been renamed the "Evening American", merged in 1961 with the "Daily Record" to form the "Record American". The "Sunday Advertiser" and "Record American" would ultimately be merged in 1972 into "The Boston Herald Traveler" a line of newspapers that stretched back to the old "Boston Herald".

In 1946, Herald-Traveler Corporation acquired Boston radio station <a href="WEEI%20%28AM%29">WHDH</a>. Two years later, WHDH-FM was licensed, and on November 26, 1957, <a href="WHDH-TV%20%28defunct%29">WHDH-TV</a> made its début as an <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> affiliate on channel 5. In 1961, WHDH-TV's affiliation switched to <a href="CBS">CBS</a>. Herald-Traveler Corp. operated for years under temporary authority from the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> stemming from controversy over luncheon meetings the newspaper's chief executive had with an FCC commissioner during the original licensing process (Some Boston broadcast historians accuse the "<a href="Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>" of being covertly behind the proceeding. The "Herald Traveler" was Republican in sympathies, and the "Globe" then had a firm policy of not endorsing political candidates.) The FCC ordered comparative hearings, and in 1969 a competing applicant, <a href="Boston%20Broadcasters%2C%20Inc.">Boston Broadcasters, Inc.</a> was granted a construction permit to replace WHDH-TV on channel 5. Herald-Traveler Corp. fought the decision in court—by this time, revenues from channel 5 were all but keeping the newspaper afloat—but its final appeal ran out in 1972, and on March 19 WHDH-TV was forced to surrender channel 5 to the new <a href="WCVB-TV">WCVB-TV</a>.

Without a television station to subsidize the newspaper, the "Herald Traveler" was no longer able to remain in business, and the newspaper was sold to <a href="Hearst%20Corporation">Hearst Corporation</a>, which published the rival all-day newspaper, the "Record American". The two papers were merged to become an all-day paper called the "Boston Herald Traveler and Record American" in the morning and "Record-American and Boston Herald Traveler" in the afternoon. The first editions published under the new combined name were those of June 19, 1972. The afternoon edition was soon dropped and the unwieldy name shortened to "Boston Herald American", with the Sunday edition called the "Sunday Herald Advertiser". The "Herald American" was printed in <a href="broadsheet">broadsheet</a> format, and failed to target a particular readership; where the "Record American" had been a typical city <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a>, the "Herald Traveler" was a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> paper.

The "Herald American" converted to <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> format in September 1981, but Hearst faced steep declines in circulation and advertising. The company announced it would close the "Herald American"—making Boston a one-newspaper town—on December 3, 1982. When the deadline came, Australian media baron <a href="Rupert%20Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a> was negotiating to buy the paper and save it. He closed on the deal after 30 hours of talks with Hearst and newspaper unions—and five hours after Hearst had sent out notices to newsroom employees telling them they were terminated. The newspaper announced its own survival the next day with a full-page headline: "You Bet We're Alive!"

Murdoch changed the paper's name back to the "Boston Herald". The "Herald" continued to grow, expanding its coverage and increasing its circulation until 2001, when nearly all newspapers fell victim to declining circulations and revenue.

In February 1994, Murdoch's <a href="News%20Corporation">News Corporation</a> was forced to sell the paper, in order that its subsidiary <a href="Fox%20Television%20Stations">Fox Television Stations</a> could legally consummate its purchase of <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> affiliate <a href="WFXT-TV">WFXT</a> (Channel 25) because Massachusetts Senator <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> included language in an appropriations barring one company from owning a newspaper and television station in the same market. <a href="Patrick%20J.%20Purcell">Patrick J. Purcell</a>, who was the publisher of the "Boston Herald" and a former <a href="News%20Corporation">News Corporation</a> executive, purchased the "Herald" and established it as an independent newspaper. Several years later, Purcell would give the "Herald" a suburban presence it never had by purchasing the money-losing <a href="Community%20Newspaper%20Company">Community Newspaper Company</a> from <a href="Fidelity%20Investments">Fidelity Investments</a>. Although the companies merged under the banner of Herald Media, Inc., the suburban papers maintained their distinct editorial and marketing identity.

After years of operating profits at Community Newspaper and losses at the "Herald", Purcell in 2006 sold the suburban chain to newspaper conglomerate Liberty Group Publishing of Illinois, which soon after changed its name to <a href="GateHouse%20Media">GateHouse Media</a>. The deal, which also saw GateHouse acquiring "<a href="The%20Patriot%20Ledger">The Patriot Ledger</a>" and "<a href="The%20Enterprise%20%28Brockton%29">The Enterprise</a>" respectively in south suburban <a href="Quincy%2C%20Massachusetts">Quincy</a> and <a href="Brockton%2C%20Massachusetts">Brockton</a>, netted $225 million for Purcell, who vowed to use the funds to clear the "Herald"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> debt and reinvest in the Paper.

On August 5, 2013, the "Herald" launched an internet radio station named Boston Herald Radio which includes radio shows by much of the Herald staff. The station's morning lineup is simulcast on 830 AM <a href="WCRN">WCRN</a> from 10 AM Eastern time to 12 noon Eastern time.

The "Herald" four <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Editorial%20Writing">Pulitzer Prizes for Editorial Writing</a>, in 1924, 1927, 1949 and 1954, are among the most awarded to a single newspaper in the category. In 1957 <a href="Harry%20Trask">Harry Trask</a> was a young staff photographer at the "Traveler" when he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his photo sequence of the sinking of in July 1956. "Herald" photographer <a href="Stanley%20Forman">Stanley Forman</a> received two Pulitzer Prizes consecutively in 1976 and 1977, the first for "<a href="Fire%20Escape%20Collapse">Fire Escape Collapse</a>", a dramatic shot of a young child falling in mid-air from her mother's arms on the upper stories of a burning apartment building to the waiting arms of firefighters below. The 1977 Pulitzer was awarded for "<a href="The%20Soiling%20of%20Old%20Glory">The Soiling of Old Glory</a>", as <a href="Ted%20Landsmark">Ted Landsmark</a>, an <a href="African%20American">African American</a> civil rights lawyer, was charged at by a protester with an <a href="flag%20of%20the%20United%20States">American flag</a> during the <a href="Boston%20busing%20crisis">Boston busing crisis</a>. The 1978 Pulitzer for Feature photography for staff coverage of <a href="1978%20Northeastern%20United%20States%20blizzard">The Blizzard of 1978.</a>

In 2006, the "Herald" won two SABEW awards from the <a href="Society%20of%20American%20Business%20Editors%20and%20Writers">Society of American Business Editors and Writers</a>: one for its breaking news coverage of the takeover of the Boston-based <a href="Gillette%20%28brand%29">Gillette Company</a> by <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a>, and another for "overall excellence."


Borges has been named Massachusetts Sportswriter of the Year by the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Sportswriters%20and%20Sports%20Broadcasters">National Association of Sportswriters and Sports Broadcasters</a> five times since 1999. He also holds the record for most first prizes and overall awards in the annual competition of the Professional Boxing Writers Association. He has also been awarded a half dozen writing awards in the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> Sports Editors' annual competition and his work has been included in the annual anthology "Best Sports Stories" eight times. He has been awarded either a first or second prize 20 times in writing competitions held by the Professional Football Writers Association as well, including multiple awards in the same year three times. In 1995, he was the recipient of the <a href="Nat%20Fleischer%20Award">Nat Fleischer Award</a> for boxing journalism from the <a href="Boxing%20Writers%20Association%20of%20America">Boxing Writers Association of America</a>. He is one of less than 25 boxing writers to ever receive that honor.

Borges' hostile opinions have frequently earned him criticism. He has severely criticized <a href="Bill%20Belichick">Bill Belichick</a>; some media figures, including <a href="Bill%20Simmons">Bill Simmons</a>, have asserted that this is because Borges relied on former quarterback <a href="Drew%20Bledsoe">Drew Bledsoe</a>, benched and traded by Belichick, as his primary source of Patriots information. Borges also wrote a controversial column asserting that <a href="Lance%20Armstrong">Lance Armstrong</a> is not an athlete.

Ron Borges also played a part in starting the long running feud between the Boston Globe and <a href="Boston">Boston</a> sports talk radio station <a href="WEEI%20%28AM%29">WEEI</a>. In 1999, the "Boston Globe"'s executive sports editor banned "Globe" sportswriters from appearing on WEEI's afternoon '<a href="The%20Big%20Show%20%28sports%20radio%20show%29">The Big Show</a>' after Borges appeared on it and allegedly used a racial slur to describe <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> pitcher <a href="Hideki%20Irabu">Hideki Irabu</a>. <a href="Glenn%20Ordway">Glenn Ordway</a>, host of the show defended Borges stating that he was only trying to 'recall <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">Yankees</a> owner <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a>'s infamous description of Irabu as a "fat, pussy toad." Ordway claims he corrected Borges on the air and was surprised when the ban was announced. Two weeks later, Skwar banned Globe sportswriters from appearing on WEEI's morning <a href="John%20Dennis%20%28talk%20show%20host%29">Dennis</a> and <a href="Gerry%20Callahan">Callahan</a> Show because of its perceived lowbrow humor. After this ban, WEEI retaliated by banning "Globe" sportswriters from all WEEI programs.

In June 2004, Borges was involved in a physical altercation with "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" and MaxBoxing.com reporter <a href="Michael%20Katz%20%28journalist%29">Michael Katz</a> at a <a href="press%20conference">press conference</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a>. Reports state that Katz was in the process of interviewing boxing promoter <a href="Bob%20Arum">Bob Arum</a> when Borges interrupted to ask Arum a question. Katz objected to the interruption and allegedly accused Borges of "being a shill for" boxing promoter <a href="Don%20King%20%28boxing%20promoter%29">Don King</a>. In a column earlier in the year Katz had called Borges "a vomit-smelling sleaze" and criticized Borges for "writing about a fight without revealing he was being paid by King to provide television commentary". Borges responded by striking Katz, who responded by striking at Borges with his cane. Katz was described as "a short, fat man in his 60s who walks with a cane and wears a neck brace because of chronic back problems". The fight between the two was broken up by Arum and his aide.

On March 4, 2007, Borges was caught in <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a> allegations after an online reader on <a href="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a>'s <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> <a href="message%20board">message board</a> revealed that there were extensive similarities between a March 4 article by Borges in the Boston Globe and a February 25 article written by sportswriter <a href="Mike%20Sando">Mike Sando</a> of the <a href="Tacoma%20News%20Tribune">Tacoma News Tribune</a>. On March 5, Borges was suspended for plagiarism by the Globe, without pay, and barred from broadcast appearances for two months.


On May 18, 2007, Less than two weeks after returning from his 2-month suspension for plagiarism, Borges announced his retirement from the "Globe". In October 2008, Borges resumed his role as a Boston sportswriter, this time with the "Boston Herald".

Babe Ruth

George Herman "Babe" Ruth Jr. (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948) was an American professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> player whose career in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) spanned 22 seasons, from 1914 through 1935. Nicknamed "The Bambino" and "The Sultan of Swat", he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> for the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> for the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including career <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s (714), <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBIs) (2,213), <a href="bases%20on%20balls">bases on balls</a> (2,062), <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> (.690), and <a href="on-base%20plus%20slugging">on-base plus slugging</a> (OPS) (1.164); the latter two still stand today. Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20States">American culture</a> and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. In , Ruth was elected into the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> as one of its <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201936">"first five"</a> inaugural members.

At age seven, Ruth was sent to <a href="Cardinal%20Gibbons%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys</a>, a reformatory where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the <a href="Institute%20of%20the%20Brothers%20of%20the%20Christian%20Schools">Christian Brothers</a>, the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor-league</a> baseball for the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20%28minor%20league%29">Baltimore Orioles</a> but was soon sold to the Red Sox. By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 <a href="dead-ball%20era">dead-ball era</a>. Although Ruth twice <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">won</a> 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> championship teams with Boston, he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, he broke the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20progressive%20single-season%20home%20run%20leaders">MLB single-season home run record</a> in 1919.

After that season, Red Sox owner <a href="Harry%20Frazee">Harry Frazee</a> sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy. The trade fueled Boston's subsequent 86 year championship drought and popularized the "<a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Bambino">Curse of the Bambino</a>" superstition. In his 15 years with the Yankees, Ruth helped the team win seven <a href="List%20of%20American%20League%20pennant%20winners">American League (AL) championships</a> and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport's popularity but also helped usher in baseball's <a href="live-ball%20era">live-ball era</a>, which evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor. As part of the Yankees' vaunted "<a href="Murderer%27s%20Row">Murderer's Row</a>" lineup of 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs, which extended his MLB single-season record. Ruth's last season with the Yankees was 1934; he retired from the game the following year, after a short stint with the <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Boston Braves</a>. During his career, Ruth led the AL in home runs during a season twelve times.

Ruth's legendary power and charismatic personality made him a larger-than-life figure during the <a href="Roaring%20Twenties">Roaring Twenties</a>. During his career, he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied a managerial job in baseball, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with <a href="esophageal%20cancer">cancer</a>, which claimed his life two years later.

George Herman Ruth Jr. was born in 1895 at 216 Emory Street in the <a href="Pigtown%2C%20Baltimore">Pigtown</a> section of <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, Maryland. Ruth's parents, George Herman Ruth Sr. (1871–1918) and Katherine Schamberger, were both of <a href="German%20Americans">German American</a> ancestry. According to the 1880 census, his parents were born in Maryland. His paternal grandparents were from Prussia and Hanover. Ruth Sr. worked a series of jobs that included <a href="lightning%20rod">lightning rod</a> salesman and <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> operator. The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business on Frederick Street. George Ruth Jr. was born in the house of his maternal grandfather, Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and trade unionist. Only one of young George's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.

Many details of Ruth's childhood are unknown, including the date of his parents' marriage. Ruth spoke <a href="German%20language">German</a> in his childhood. When young George was a toddler, the family moved to 339 South Goodyear Street, not far from the rail yards; by the time the boy was 6, his father had a saloon with an upstairs apartment at 426 West Camden Street. Details are equally scanty about why young George was sent at the age of 7 to <a href="Cardinal%20Gibbons%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys</a>, a reformatory and orphanage. As an adult, Babe Ruth reminisced that as a youth he been running the streets and rarely attending school, as well was drinking beer when his father was not looking. Some accounts say that, after a violent incident at his father's saloon, the city authorities decided this environment was unsuitable for a small child. At St. Mary's, which George Jr. entered on June 13, 1902, he was recorded as "incorrigible"; he spent much of the next twelve years there.
Although St. Mary's inmates received an education, students were also expected to learn work skills and help operate the school, particularly once the boys turned 12. Ruth became a shirtmaker and was also proficient as a carpenter. He would adjust his own shirt collars, rather than having a tailor do so, even during his well-paid baseball career. The boys, aged 5 to 21, did most work around the facility, from cooking to shoemaking, and renovated St. Mary's in 1912. The food was simple, and the <a href="Xaverian%20Brothers">Xaverian Brothers</a> who ran the school insisted on strict discipline; corporal punishment was common. Ruth's nickname there was "Niggerlips", as he had large facial features and was darker than most boys at the all-white reformatory.

Ruth was sometimes allowed to rejoin his family, or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with work in the community, but he was always returned to St. Mary's. He was rarely visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Mary's only to attend the funeral. How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St. Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore's windows with long <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> while playing <a href="stickball">street ball</a>; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St. Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a <a href="catcher">catcher</a> even though left-handers rarely play that position. During his time there he also played <a href="third%20base">third base</a> and <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a>, again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers. He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia. A large man, Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness. For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's. Ruth stated, "I think I was born as a hitter the first day I ever saw him hit a baseball." The older man became a mentor and role model to George; biographer <a href="Robert%20W.%20Creamer">Robert W. Creamer</a> commented on the closeness between the two:

The school's influence remained with Ruth in other ways. He was a lifelong <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> who would sometimes attend Mass after carousing all night, and he became a well-known member of the <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a>. He would visit orphanages, schools, and hospitals throughout his life, often avoiding publicity. He was generous to St. Mary's as he became famous and rich, donating money and his presence at fundraisers, and spending $5,000 to buy Brother Matthias a Cadillac in 1926—subsequently replacing it when it was destroyed in an accident. 

Most of the boys at St. Mary's played baseball in organized leagues at different levels of proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions at one time or another (including <a href="infield">infield</a> positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a>. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s.

In early 1914, Ruth signed a professional baseball contract with <a href="Jack%20Dunn%20%28baseball%29">Jack Dunn</a>, who owned and managed the <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor-league</a> <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20%28minor%20league%29">Baltimore Orioles</a>, an <a href="International%20League">International League</a> team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing are not known with certainty; historical fact is obscured by stories that cannot all be true. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, <a href="Mount%20St.%20Mary%27s%20University">Mount St. Mary's College</a>. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> pitcher <a href="Joe%20Engel">Joe Engel</a>, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21.
The train journey to spring training in <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Fayetteville, North Carolina</a>, in early March was likely Ruth's first outside the Baltimore area. The rookie ballplayer was the subject of various pranks by the veterans, who were probably also the source of his famous nickname. There are various accounts of how Ruth came to be called Babe, but most center on his being referred to as "Dunnie's babe" or a variant. "Babe" was at that time a common nickname in baseball, with perhaps the most famous to that point being <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> pitcher and <a href="1909%20World%20Series">1909 World Series</a> hero <a href="Babe%20Adams">Babe Adams</a>, who appeared younger than he was.

Ruth made his first appearance as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop and pitched the last two <a href="inning">inning</a>s of a 15–9 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by <a href="Jim%20Thorpe">Jim Thorpe</a> in Fayetteville. Ruth made first appearance against a team in <a href="organized%20baseball">organized baseball</a> in an exhibition game versus the major-league <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In a game against the Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest of the way. The Orioles scored seven runs in the bottom of the eighth inining to overcome a 6–0 deficit, and Ruth was the winning pitcher.

Once the regular season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also dangerous at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the <a href="Federal%20League">Federal League</a>, had begun play, and the local franchise, the <a href="Baltimore%20Terrapins">Baltimore Terrapins</a>, restored that city to the major leagues for the first time since 1902. Few fans visited <a href="Oriole%20Park">Oriole Park</a>, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.

The competition from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses. Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, as well as the sale of a minority interest in the club. These possibilities fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money. He offered Ruth to the reigning <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> champions, <a href="Connie%20Mack">Connie Mack</a>'s <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>, but Mack had his own financial problems. The <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers <a href="Ernie%20Shore">Ernie Shore</a> and <a href="Ben%20Egan">Ben Egan</a>, to the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> of the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) on July 4. The sale price was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11.

On July 11, 1914, Ruth arrived in Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later told the story of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who would be the girl that he would first marry. She was a 16-year-old waitress at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4–3, over the <a href="Cleveland%20Naps">Cleveland Naps</a>. He pitched to catcher <a href="Bill%20Carrigan">Bill Carrigan</a>, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a <a href="Starting%20pitcher">start</a> by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. As a batter in his major-league debut, Ruth went <a href="batting%20average">0-for-2</a> against left-hander <a href="Willie%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29">Willie Mitchell</a>, <a href="Strikeout">striking out</a> in his first <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>, before being removed for a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> in the seventh inning. Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Braves</a>, begin <a href="1914%20Boston%20Braves%20season">a legendary comeback</a> that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the <a href="1914%20World%20Series">1914 World Series</a> championship.

Egan was traded to Cleveland after two weeks on the Boston roster. During his time as a Red Sox, he kept an eye on the inexperienced Ruth, much as Dunn had in Baltimore. When he was traded, no one took his place as supervisor. Ruth's new teammates considered him brash, and would have preferred him, as a rookie, to remain quiet and inconspicuous. When Ruth insisted on taking batting practice despite his being both a rookie who did not play regularly, and a pitcher, he arrived to find his bats sawn in half. His teammates nicknamed him "the Big Baboon", a name the swarthy Ruth, who had disliked the nickname "Niggerlips" at St. Mary's, detested. Ruth had received a raise on promotion to the major leagues, and quickly acquired tastes for fine food, liquor, and women, among other temptations.

Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth to pitch two <a href="exhibition%20game">exhibition game</a>s in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, he was not restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for the screen in "<a href="The%20Babe%20Ruth%20Story">The Babe Ruth Story</a>" (1948)—that the young pitcher had a habit of signaling his intent to throw a <a href="curveball">curveball</a> by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.
On July 30, 1914, Boston owner <a href="Joseph%20Lannin">Joseph Lannin</a> had purchased the minor-league <a href="Providence%20Grays%20%28minor%20league%29">Providence Grays</a>, members of the International League. The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, including star hitter <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, and as part of the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays. This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner <a href="Garry%20Herrmann">Garry Herrmann</a> <a href="Waivers%20%28MLB%29">claimed him off waivers</a>. After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop as a player, and would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent to the minors. Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence to make him a better player, but to help the Grays win the International League <a href="pennant%20%28sports%29">pennant</a> (league championship).

Ruth joined the Grays on August 18, 1914. After Dunn's deals, the Baltimore Orioles managed to hold on to first place until August 15, after which they continued to fade, leaving the pennant race between Providence and <a href="Rochester%20Red%20Wings">Rochester</a>. Ruth was deeply impressed by Providence manager <a href="Bill%20Donovan">"Wild Bill" Donovan</a>, previously a star pitcher with a 25–4 <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win–loss record</a> for Detroit in 1907; in later years, he credited Donovan with teaching him much about pitching. Ruth was often called upon to pitch, in one stretch starting (and winning) four games in eight days. On September 5 at <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Park">Maple Leaf Park</a> in Toronto, Ruth pitched a one-hit 9–0 victory, and hit his first professional home run, his only one as a minor leaguer, off <a href="Ellis%20Johnson%20%28baseball%29">Ellis Johnson</a>. Recalled to Boston after Providence finished the season in first place, he pitched and won a game for the Red Sox against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> on October 2, getting his first major league hit, a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a>. Ruth finished the season with a record of 2–1 as a major leaguer and 23–8 in the International League (for Baltimore and Providence). Once the season concluded, Ruth married Helen in <a href="Ellicott%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ellicott City, Maryland</a>. Creamer speculated that they did not marry in Baltimore, where the newlyweds boarded with George Ruth Sr., to avoid possible interference from those at St. Mary's—both bride and groom were not yet of age and Ruth remained on parole from that institution until his 21st birthday.

In March 1915, Ruth reported to <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a> for his first major league <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a>. Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two stellar left-handed pitchers: the established stars <a href="Dutch%20Leonard%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Dutch Leonard</a>, who had broken the record for the lowest <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA) in a single season; and <a href="Ray%20Collins%20%28baseball%29">Ray Collins</a>, a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief</a> appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the <a href="Polo%20Grounds">Polo Grounds</a>. Ruth took a 3–2 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4–3 in 13 innings. Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in <a href="right%20fielder">right field</a> off of <a href="Jack%20Warhop">Jack Warhop</a>. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher to give up a home run to Babe Ruth.
Carrigan was sufficiently impressed by Ruth's pitching to give him a spot in the starting rotation. Ruth finished the 1915 season 18–8 as a pitcher; as a hitter, he batted .315 and had four home runs. The Red Sox won the <a href="List%20of%20American%20League%20pennant%20winners">AL pennant</a>, but with the pitching staff healthy, Ruth was not called upon to pitch in the <a href="1915%20World%20Series">1915 World Series</a> against the Philadelphia Phillies. Boston won in five games; Ruth was used as a pinch hitter in Game Five, but <a href="Ground%20out%20%28baseball%29">grounded out</a> against Phillies ace <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%20Alexander">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a>. Despite his success as a pitcher, Ruth was acquiring a reputation for long home runs; at <a href="Sportsman%27s%20Park">Sportsman's Park</a> against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>, a Ruth hit soared over Grand Avenue, breaking the window of a <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> dealership.

In 1916, there was attention focused on Ruth for his pitching, as he engaged in repeated pitching duels with the ace of the Washington Senators, <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>. The two met five times during the season, with Ruth winning four and Johnson one (Ruth had a <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">no decision</a> in Johnson's victory). Two of Ruth's victories were by the score of 1–0, one in a 13-inning game. Of the 1–0 <a href="Shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a> decided without extra innings, AL President <a href="Ban%20Johnson">Ban Johnson</a> stated, "That was one of the best ball games I have ever seen." For the season, Ruth went 23–12, with a 1.75 ERA and nine shutouts, both of which led the league. Ruth's nine shutouts in 1916 set a league record for left-handers that would remain unmatched until <a href="Ron%20Guidry">Ron Guidry</a> tied it in 1978. The Red Sox won the pennant and <a href="1916%20World%20Series">World Series</a> again, this time defeating the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Superbas</a> (as the Dodgers were then known) in five games. Ruth started and won Game 2, 2–1, in 14 innings. Until another game of that length was played in <a href="2005%20World%20Series">2005</a>, this was the longest World Series game, and Ruth's pitching performance is still the longest postseason <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a> victory.

Carrigan retired as player and manager after 1916, returning to his native Maine to be a businessman. Ruth, who played under four managers who are in the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, always maintained that Carrigan, who is not enshrined there, was the best skipper he ever played for. There were other changes in the Red Sox organization that offseason, as Lannin sold the team to a three-man group headed by New York theatrical promoter <a href="Harry%20Frazee">Harry Frazee</a>. <a href="Jack%20Barry%20%28baseball%29">Jack Barry</a> was hired by Frazee as manager.

Ruth went 24–13 with a 2.01 ERA and six shutouts in 1917, but the Sox finished in second place in the league, nine <a href="games%20behind">games behind</a> the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> in the standings. On June 23 at Washington, Ruth made a memorable pitching start. When home plate umpire '<a href="Brick%20Owens">Brick' Owens</a> called the first four pitches as balls, Ruth threw a punch at him, and was ejected from the game and later suspended for ten days and fined $100. Ernie Shore was called in to relieve Ruth, and was allowed eight warm-up pitches. The runner who had reached base on the <a href="base%20on%20balls">walk</a> was <a href="caught%20stealing">caught stealing</a>, and Shore retired all 26 batters he faced to win the game. Shore's feat was listed as a <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a> for many years; in 1991, <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s (MLB) Committee on Statistical Accuracy caused it to be listed as a combined <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a>. In 1917, Ruth was little-used as a batter, other than for his <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>s while pitching, and hit .325 with two home runs.
The entry of the United States into World War I occurred at the start of the season and overshadowed the sport. Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players in the big leagues were of draft age. This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Reserve">Naval Reserve</a> in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called up after the 1917 season. Frazee hired International League President <a href="Ed%20Barrow">Ed Barrow</a> as Red Sox manager. Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally. With the major leagues shorthanded due to the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.

Ruth also noticed these vacancies in the lineup; he was dissatisfied in the role of a pitcher who appeared every four or five days and wanted to play every day at another position. Barrow used Ruth at <a href="first%20baseman">first base</a> and in the <a href="outfield">outfield</a> during the exhibition season, but he restricted him to pitching as the team moved towards Boston and the season opener. At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.

Inexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player <a href="Harry%20Hooper">Harry Hooper</a> advise him on baseball game strategy. Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position when he was not pitching, arguing to Barrow, who had invested in the club, that the crowds were larger on days when Ruth played, as they were attracted by his hitting. Barrow gave in early in May; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson. For the first time in his career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was assigned a place in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">batting order</a> higher than ninth.

Although Barrow predicted that Ruth would beg to return to pitching the first time he experienced a batting slump, that did not occur. Barrow used Ruth primarily as an outfielder in the war-shortened 1918 season. Ruth hit .300, with 11 home runs, enough to secure him a share of the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20annual%20home%20run%20leaders">major league home run title</a> with <a href="Tillie%20Walker">Tillie Walker</a> of the Philadelphia Athletics. He was still occasionally used as a pitcher, and had a 13–7 record with a 2.22 ERA.

In 1918, the Red Sox won their third pennant in four years and faced the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> in the <a href="1918%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, which began on September 5, the earliest date in history. The season had been shortened because the government had ruled that baseball players who were eligible for the military would have to be inducted or work in critical war industries, such as armaments plants. Ruth pitched and won Game One for the Red Sox, a 1–0 shutout. Before Game Four, Ruth injured his left hand in a fight; he pitched anyway. He gave up seven hits and six walks, but was helped by outstanding fielding behind him and by his own batting efforts, as a fourth-inning <a href="Triple%20%28baseball%29">triple</a> by Ruth gave his team a 2–0 lead. The Cubs tied the game in the eighth inning, but the Red Sox scored to take a 3–2 again in the bottom of that inning. After Ruth gave up a hit and a walk to start the ninth inning, he was relieved on the mound by <a href="Bullet%20Joe%20Bush">Joe Bush</a>. To keep Ruth and his bat in the game, he was sent to play <a href="left%20fielder">left field</a>. Bush retired the side to give Ruth his second win of the Series, and the third and last World Series pitching victory of his career, against no defeats, in three pitching appearances. Ruth's effort gave his team a three-games-to-one lead, and two days later the Red Sox won their third Series in four years, four-games-to-two. Before allowing the Cubs to score in Game Four, Ruth pitched consecutive scoreless innings, a record for the World Series that stood for more than 40 years until 1961, broken by <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Whitey Ford</a> after Ruth's death. Ruth was prouder of that record than he was of any of his batting feats.
With the World Series over, Ruth gained exemption from the war draft by accepting a nominal position with a Pennsylvania steel mill. Many industrial establishments took pride in their baseball teams and sought to hire major leaguers. The end of the war in November set Ruth free to play baseball without such contrivances.

During the 1919 season, Ruth was used as a pitcher in only 17 of his 130 games and compiled an 8–5 record. Barrow used him as a pitcher mostly in the early part of the season, when the Red Sox manager still had hopes of a second consecutive pennant. By late June, the Red Sox were clearly out of the race, and Barrow had no objection to Ruth concentrating on his hitting, if only because it drew people to the ballpark. Ruth had hit a home run against the Yankees on Opening Day, and another during a month-long batting slump that soon followed. Relieved of his pitching duties, Ruth began an unprecedented spell of slugging home runs, which gave him widespread public and press attention. Even his failures were seen as majestic—one sportswriter noted, "When Ruth misses a swipe at the ball, the stands quiver".

Two home runs by Ruth on July 5, and one in each of two consecutive games a week later, raised his season total to 11, tying his career best from 1918. The first record to fall was the AL single-season mark of 16, set by <a href="Socks%20Seybold">Ralph "Socks" Seybold</a> in 1902. Ruth matched that on July 29, then pulled ahead toward the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20progressive%20single-season%20home%20run%20leaders">major league record</a> of 24, set by <a href="Buck%20Freeman">Buck Freeman</a> in 1899. Ruth reached this on September 8, by which time, writers had discovered that <a href="Ned%20Williamson">Ned Williamson</a> of the 1884 <a href="Chicago%20White%20Stockings%20%281870%E2%80%9389%29">Chicago White Stockings</a> had hit 27—though in a ballpark where the distance to right field was only . On September 20, "Babe Ruth Day" at Fenway Park, Ruth won the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying Williamson. He broke the record four days later against the Yankees at the Polo Grounds, and hit one more against the Senators to finish with 29. The home run at Washington made Ruth the first major league player to hit a home run at all eight ballparks in his league. In spite of Ruth's hitting heroics, the Red Sox finished sixth, games behind the league champion White Sox.

As an out-of-towner from New York City, Frazee had been regarded with suspicion by Boston's sportswriters and baseball fans when he bought the team. He won them over with success on the field and a willingness to build the Red Sox by purchasing or trading for players. He offered the Senators $60,000 for Walter Johnson, but Washington owner <a href="Clark%20Griffith">Clark Griffith</a> was unwilling. Even so, Frazee was successful in bringing other players to Boston, especially as replacements for players in the military. This willingness to spend for players helped the Red Sox secure the 1918 title. The 1919 season saw record-breaking attendance, and Ruth's home runs for Boston made him a national sensation. In March 1919 Ruth was reported as having accepted a three-year contract for a total of $27,000, after protracted negotiations. Nevertheless, on December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Ruth's contract to the New York Yankees.
Not all of the circumstances concerning the sale are known, but brewer and former congressman <a href="Jacob%20Ruppert">Jacob Ruppert</a>, the New York team's principal owner, reportedly asked Yankee manager <a href="Miller%20Huggins">Miller Huggins</a> what the team needed to be successful. "Get Ruth from Boston", Huggins supposedly replied, noting that Frazee was perennially in need of money to finance his theatrical productions. In any event, there was precedent for the Ruth transaction: when Boston pitcher <a href="Carl%20Mays">Carl Mays</a> left the Red Sox in a 1919 dispute, Frazee had settled the matter by selling Mays to the Yankees, though over the opposition of AL President Johnson.

According to one of Ruth's biographers, Jim Reisler, "why Frazee needed cash in 1919—and large infusions of it quickly—is still, more than 80 years later, a bit of a mystery". The often-told story is that Frazee needed money to finance the musical "<a href="No%2C%20No%2C%20Nanette">No, No, Nanette</a>", which was a Broadway hit and brought Frazee financial security. That play did not open until 1925, however, by which time Frazee had sold the Red Sox. Still, the story may be true in essence: "No, No, Nanette" was based on a Frazee-produced play, "My Lady Friends", which opened in 1919.

There were other financial pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, fully aware of baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from the purchase of the club.

Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel <a href="Tillinghast%20L%27Hommedieu%20Huston">Tillinghast Huston</a>, were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.

Frazee sold the rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.

The transaction was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly accomplished—Ruth agreed to fulfill the remaining two years on his contract, but was given a $20,000 bonus, payable over two seasons. The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered at the loss of Ruth; others conceded that the slugger had become difficult to deal with. "The New York Times" suggested presciently, "The short right field wall at the Polo Grounds should prove an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer." According to Reisler, "The Yankees had pulled off the sports steal of the century."

According to Marty Appel in his history of the Yankees, the transaction, "changed the fortunes of two high-profile franchises for decades". The Red Sox, winners of five of the first sixteen World Series, those played between 1903 and 1919, would not win another pennant until 1946, or another World Series until <a href="2004%20World%20Series">2004</a>, a drought attributed in baseball superstition to Frazee's sale of Ruth and sometimes dubbed the "<a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Bambino">Curse of the Bambino</a>". The Yankees, on the other hand, had not won the AL championship prior to their acquisition of Ruth. They won seven AL pennants and four World Series with Ruth, and lead baseball with 40 pennants and 27 World Series titles in their history.

When Ruth signed with the Yankees, he completed his transition from a pitcher to a power-hitting outfielder. His fifteen-season Yankee career consisted of over 2,000 games, and Ruth broke many batting records while making only five widely scattered appearances on the mound, winning all of them.

At the end of April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, with the Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself swinging the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home that sent the ball completely out of the Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by <a href="Shoeless%20Joe%20Jackson">Shoeless Joe Jackson</a>. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, and by the end of the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance: on May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth play when the Yankees were on the road.
The home runs kept coming; Ruth tied his own record of 29 on July 15, and broke it with home runs in both games of a doubleheader four days later. By the end of July, he had 37, but his pace slackened somewhat after that. Nevertheless, on September 4, he both tied and broke the organized baseball record for home runs in a season, snapping <a href="Perry%20Werden">Perry Werden</a>'s 1895 mark of 44 in the minor <a href="Western%20League%20%28original%29">Western League</a>. The Yankees played well as a team, battling for the league lead early in the summer, but slumped in August in the AL pennant battle with Chicago and Cleveland. The championship was won by Cleveland, surging ahead after the <a href="Black%20Sox%20Scandal">Black Sox Scandal</a> broke on September 28 and led to the suspension of many of the team's top players, including Joe Jackson. The Yankees finished third, but drew 1.2 million fans to the Polo Grounds, the first time a team had drawn a seven figure attendance. The rest of the league sold 600,000 more tickets, many fans there to see Ruth, who led the league with 54 home runs, 158 <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a>, and 137 <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBIs).

In 1920 and afterwards, Ruth was aided in his power hitting by the fact that A.J. Reach Company—the maker of baseballs used in the major leagues—was using a more efficient machine to wind the yarn found within the baseball. The new baseballs went into play in 1920 and ushered the start of the <a href="live-ball%20era">live-ball era</a>; the number of home runs increased by 184 over the previous year across the major leagues. Baseball statistician <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> pointed out that while Ruth was likely aided by the change in the baseball, there were other factors at work, including the gradual abolition of the <a href="spitball">spitball</a> (accelerated after the death of <a href="Ray%20Chapman">Ray Chapman</a>, struck by a pitched ball thrown by Mays in August 1920) and the more frequent use of new baseballs (also a response to Chapman's death). Nevertheless, James theorized that Ruth's 1920 explosion might have happened in 1919, had a full season of 154 games been played rather than 140, had Ruth refrained from pitching 133 innings that season, and if he were playing at any other home field but Fenway Park, where he hit only 9 of 29 home runs.
Yankees business manager Harry Sparrow had died early in the 1920 season; to replace him, Ruppert and Huston hired Barrow. Ruppert and Barrow quickly made a deal with Frazee for New York to acquire some of the players who would be mainstays of the early Yankee pennant-winning teams, including catcher <a href="Wally%20Schang">Wally Schang</a> and pitcher <a href="Waite%20Hoyt">Waite Hoyt</a>. The 21-year-old Hoyt became close to Ruth:

Ruth hit home runs early and often in the 1921 season, during which he broke <a href="Roger%20Connor">Roger Connor</a>'s mark for home runs in a career, 138. Each of the almost 600 home runs Ruth hit in his career after that extended his own record. After a slow start, the Yankees were soon locked in a tight pennant race with Cleveland, winners of the <a href="1920%20World%20Series">1920 World Series</a>. On September 15, Ruth hit his 55th home run, shattering his year-old single season record. In late September, the Yankees visited Cleveland and won three out of four games, giving them the upper hand in the race, and clinched their first pennant a few days later. Ruth finished the regular season with 59 home runs, batting .378 and with a <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> of .846.

The Yankees had high expectations when they met the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> in the <a href="1921%20World%20Series">1921 World Series</a>. The Yankees won the first two games with Ruth in the lineup. However, Ruth badly scraped his elbow during Game 2, sliding into third base (he had walked and <a href="stolen%20base">stolen</a> both second and third bases). After the game, he was told by the team physician not to play the rest of the series. Despite this advice, he did play in the next three games, and pinch-hit in Game Eight of the best-of-nine series, but the Yankees lost, five games to three. Ruth hit .316, drove in five runs and hit his first World Series home run.
After the Series, Ruth and teammates <a href="Bob%20Meusel">Bob Meusel</a> and <a href="Bill%20Piercy">Bill Piercy</a> participated in a <a href="barnstorm%20%28athletics%29">barnstorming</a> tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and undermining its value. <a href="Baseball%20Commissioner">Baseball Commissioner</a> <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.

On March 6, 1922, Ruth signed a new contract for three years at $52,000 a year. This was the largest sum ever paid to a ballplayer up to that point, and it represented 40% of the team's player payroll. Despite his suspension, Ruth was named the Yankees' new on-field captain prior to the <a href="1922%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1922 season</a>. During the suspension, he worked out with the team in the morning, and played exhibition games with the Yankees on their off days. He and Meusel returned on May 20, to a sellout crowd at the Polo Grounds, but Ruth batted 0-for-4, and was booed. On May 25, he was thrown out of the game for throwing dust in umpire <a href="George%20Hildebrand">George Hildebrand</a>'s face, then climbed into the stands to confront a heckler. Ban Johnson ordered him fined, suspended, and stripped of his captaincy. In his shortened season, Ruth appeared in 110 games, batted .315, with 35 home runs, and drove in 99 runs, but the 1922 season was a disappointment in comparison to his two previous dominating years. Despite Ruth's off-year, the Yankees managed to win the pennant and faced the New York Giants in the <a href="1922%20World%20Series">World Series</a> for the second consecutive year. In the Series, Giants manager John McGraw instructed his pitchers to throw him nothing but curveballs, and Ruth never adjusted. Ruth had just two hits in seventeen at bats, and the Yankees lost to the Giants for the second straight year, by 4–0 (with one tie game). Sportswriter <a href="Joe%20Vila">Joe Vila</a> called him, "an exploded phenomenon".

After the season, Ruth was a guest at an <a href="Elks%20Club">Elks Club</a> banquet, set up by Ruth's agent with Yankee team support. There, each speaker, concluding with future New York mayor <a href="Jimmy%20Walker">Jimmy Walker</a>, censured him for his poor behavior. An emotional Ruth promised reform, and, to the surprise of many, followed through. When he reported to spring training, he was in his best shape as a Yankee, weighing only .

The Yankees' status as tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds had become increasingly uneasy, and in 1922, Giants owner <a href="Charles%20Stoneham">Charles Stoneham</a> stated that the Yankees' lease, expiring after that season, would not be renewed. Ruppert and Huston had long contemplated a new stadium, and had taken an option on property at 161st Street and River Avenue in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>. <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> was completed in time for the home opener on April 18, 1923, at which the Babe hit the first home run in what was quickly dubbed "the House that Ruth Built". The ballpark was designed with Ruth in mind: although the venue's left-field fence was further from home plate than at the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium's right-field fence was closer, making home runs easier to hit for left-handed batters. To spare Ruth's eyes, right field–his defensive position–was not pointed into the afternoon sun, as was traditional; left fielder Meusel was soon suffering headaches from squinting toward home plate.

During the 1923 season, The Yankees were never seriously challenged and won the AL pennant by 17 games. Ruth finished the season with a career-high .393 batting average and major-league leading 41 home runs (tied with <a href="Cy%20Williams">Cy Williams</a>). Ruth hit a career high 45 doubles in 1923, and he reached base 379 times, then a major league record. For the third straight year, the Yankees faced the Giants in the <a href="1923%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, which Ruth dominated. He batted .368, walked eight times, scored eight runs, hit three home runs and slugged 1.000 during the series, as the Yankees won their first World Series championship, four games to two.

In 1924, the Yankees were favored to become the first team to win four consecutive pennants. Plagued by injuries, they found themselves in a battle with the Senators. Although the Yankees won 18 of 22 at one point in September, the Senators beat out the Yankees by two games. Ruth hit .378, winning his only AL <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20batting%20champions">batting title</a>, with a league-leading 46 home runs.

Ruth had kept up his efforts to stay in shape in 1923 and 1924, but by early 1925 weighed nearly . His annual visit to <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a>, where he exercised and took saunas early in the year, did him no good as he spent much of the time carousing in the resort town. He became ill while there, and suffered relapses during spring training. Ruth collapsed in <a href="Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Asheville, North Carolina</a>, as the team journeyed north. He was put on a train for New York, where he was briefly hospitalized. A rumor circulated that he had died, prompting British newspapers to print <a href="List%20of%20premature%20obituaries">a premature obituary</a>. In New York, Ruth collapsed again and was found unconscious in his hotel bathroom. He was taken to a hospital where he suffered multiple convulsions. After sportswriter <a href="W.%20O.%20McGeehan">W. O. McGeehan</a> wrote that Ruth's illness was due to binging on hot dogs and soda pop before a game, it became known as "the bellyache heard 'round the world". However, the exact cause of his ailment has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Glenn Stout, in his history of the Yankees, notes that the Ruth legend is "still one of the most sheltered in sports"; he suggests that alcohol was at the root of Ruth's illness, pointing to the fact that Ruth remained six weeks at <a href="St.%20Vincent%27s%20Hospital%20%28Manhattan%29">St. Vincent's Hospital</a> but was allowed to leave, under supervision, for workouts with the team for part of that time. He concludes that the hospitalization was behavior-related. Playing just 98 games, Ruth had his worst season as a Yankee; he finished with a .290 average and 25 home runs. The Yankees finished next to last in the AL with a 69–85 record, their last season with a losing record until 1965.

Ruth spent part of the offseason of 1925–26 working out at <a href="Artie%20McGovern">Artie McGovern</a>'s gym, getting back into shape. Barrow and Huggins had rebuilt the team, surrounding the veteran core with good young players like <a href="Tony%20Lazzeri">Tony Lazzeri</a> and <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>. But New York was not expected to win the pennant.

Babe Ruth returned to his normal production during 1926, batting .372 with 47 home runs and 146 RBIs. The Yankees built a ten-game lead by mid-June, and coasted to win the pennant by three games. The <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> had won the National League with the lowest winning percentage for a pennant winner to that point (.578) and the Yankees were expected to win the <a href="1926%20World%20Series">World Series</a> easily. Although the Yankees won the opener in New York, St. Louis took Games Two and Three. In Game Four, Ruth hit three home runs, the first time this had been done in a World Series game, to lead the Yankees to victory; in the fifth game Ruth caught a ball as he crashed into the fence, described by baseball writers as a defensive gem. New York took that game, but <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%20Alexander">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a> won Game Six for St. Louis to tie the Series at three games each, then got very drunk. He was nevertheless inserted into Game Seven in the seventh inning and shut down the Yankees to win the game, 3–2, and win the Series. Ruth had hit his fourth home run of the Series earlier in the game, and was the only Yankee to reach base off Alexander, walking in the ninth inning before being caught stealing to end the game. Although Ruth's attempt to steal second is often deemed a baserunning blunder, Creamer pointed out that the Yankees' chances of tying the game would have been greatly improved with a runner in scoring position.
The 1926 Series was also known for Ruth's promise to <a href="Johnny%20Sylvester">Johnny Sylvester</a>, a hospitalized 11-year-old, that he would hit a home run on his behalf. Sylvester had been injured in a fall from a horse, and a friend of Sylvester's father gave the boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals, and relayed a promise from Ruth, who did not know the boy, to hit a home run for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly inflated it, and by some accounts, Ruth saved a dying boy's life by visiting him, emotionally promising to hit a home run, and doing so.

The 1927 New York Yankees team is considered one of the greatest squads that ever took the field. Known as <a href="Murderer%27s%20Row">Murderer's Row</a> because of the power of its lineup, the team won a then-AL-record 110 games, and took the AL pennant by 19 games, clinching first place on Labor Day. With little suspense as to the pennant race, the nation's attention turned to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59. He was not alone in this chase: Gehrig proved to be a slugger capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown, tying Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, they were never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45–44, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently—Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of <a href="Paul%20Hopkins%20%28baseball%29">Paul Hopkins</a>, facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off <a href="Tom%20Zachary">Tom Zachary</a> to break a 2–2 tie. "Sixty! Let's see some son of a bitch try to top that one", Ruth exulted after the game. In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted .356, drove in 164 runs and slugged .772. In the <a href="1927%20World%20Series">1927 World Series</a>, the Yankees swept the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving <a href="Forbes%20Field">Forbes Field</a>. According to Appel, "The 1927 New York Yankees. Even today, the words inspire awe ... all baseball success is measured against the '27 team."
The following season started off well for the Yankees, who led the league in the early going. But the Yankees were plagued by injuries, erratic pitching and inconsistent play. The <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>, rebuilding after some lean years, erased the Yankees' big lead and even took over first place briefly in early September. The Yankees, however, regained first place when they beat the Athletics three out of four games in a pivotal series at Yankee Stadium later that month, and clinched the pennant in the final weekend of the season. Ruth's play in 1928 mirrored his team's performance. He got off to a hot start and on August 1, he had 42 home runs. This put him ahead of his 60 home run pace from the previous season. He then slumped for the latter part of the season, and he hit just twelve home runs in the last two months. Ruth's batting average also fell to .323, well below his career average. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 54 home runs. The Yankees swept the favored Cardinals in four games in the <a href="1928%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, with Ruth batting .625 and hitting three home runs in Game Four, including one off Alexander.

Before the 1929 season, Ruppert, who had bought out Huston in 1923, announced that the Yankees would wear uniform numbers to allow fans at cavernous Yankee Stadium to tell one player from another. The Cardinals and Indians had each experimented with uniform numbers; the Yankees were the first to use them on both home and away uniforms. As Ruth batted third, he was given number 3. According to a long-standing baseball legend, the Yankees adopted their now-iconic pinstriped uniforms in hopes of making Ruth look slimmer. In truth, though, they had been wearing pinstripes since Ruppert bought the team in 1915.

Although the Yankees started well, the Athletics soon proved they were the better team in 1929, splitting two series with the Yankees in the first month of the season, then taking advantage of a Yankee losing streak in mid-May to gain first place. Although Ruth performed well, the Yankees were not able to catch the Athletics—Connie Mack had built another great team. Tragedy struck the Yankees late in the year as manager Huggins died of <a href="erysipelas">erysipelas</a>, a bacterial skin infection, on September 25, only ten days after he had last led the team. Despite past differences, Ruth praised Huggins and described him as a "great guy". The Yankees finished second, 18 games behind the Athletics. Ruth hit .345 during the season, with 46 home runs and 154 RBIs.

On October 17, the Yankees hired <a href="Bob%20Shawkey">Bob Shawkey</a> as manager, their fourth choice. Ruth had politicked for the job of player-manager, but was never seriously considered by Ruppert and Barrow; Stout deems this the first hint Ruth would have no future with the Yankees once he was done as a player. Shawkey, a former Yankees player and teammate of Ruth, would prove unable to command the slugger's respect.

On January 7, 1930, salary negotiations between the Yankees and Ruth quickly broke down. Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, Ruth promptly rejected both the Yankees' initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and their 'final' offer of two years at seventy-five—the latter figure equalling the annual salary of then US President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>; instead, Ruth demanded at least $85,000 and three years. When asked why he thought he was "worth more than the President of the United States," Ruth responded: "Say, if I hadn't been sick last summer, I'd have broken hell out of that home run record! Besides, the President gets a four-year contract. I'm only asking for three." Exactly two months later, a compromise was reached, with Ruth settling for two years at an unprecedented $80,000 per year.

In 1930, Ruth hit .359 with 49 home runs (his best in his years after 1928) and 153 RBIs, and pitched his first game in nine years, a complete game victory. Nevertheless, the Athletics won their second consecutive pennant and <a href="1930%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, as the Yankees finished in third place, sixteen games back. At the end of the season, Shawkey was fired and replaced with Cubs manager <a href="Joe%20McCarthy%20%28manager%29">Joe McCarthy</a>, though Ruth again unsuccessfully sought the job.

McCarthy was a disciplinarian, but chose not to interfere with Ruth, and the slugger for his part did not seek conflict with the manager. The team improved in 1931, but was no match for the Athletics, who won 107 games, games in front of the Yankees. Ruth, for his part, hit .373, with 46 home runs and 163 RBIs. He had 31 doubles, his most since 1924. In the 1932 season, the Yankees went 107–47 and won the pennant. Ruth's effectiveness had decreased somewhat, but he still hit .341 with 41 home runs and 137 RBIs. Nevertheless, he twice was sidelined due to injury during the season.

The Yankees faced the Cubs, McCarthy's former team, in the <a href="1932%20World%20Series">1932 World Series</a>. There was bad blood between the two teams as the Yankees resented the Cubs only awarding <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason%23Postseason%20bonuses">half a World Series share</a> to <a href="Mark%20Koenig">Mark Koenig</a>, a former Yankee. The games at Yankee Stadium had not been sellouts; both were won by the home team, with Ruth collecting two singles, but scoring four runs as he was walked four times by the Cubs pitchers. In Chicago, Ruth was resentful at the hostile crowds that met the Yankees's train and jeered them at the hotel. The crowd for Game Three included New York Governor <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, the Democratic candidate for president, who sat with Chicago Mayor <a href="Anton%20Cermak">Anton Cermak</a>. Many in the crowd threw lemons at Ruth, a sign of derision, and others (as well as the Cubs themselves) shouted abuse at Ruth and other Yankees. They were briefly silenced when Ruth hit a three-run home run off <a href="Charlie%20Root">Charlie Root</a> in the first inning, but soon revived, and the Cubs tied the score at 4–4 in the fourth inning. When Ruth came to the plate in the top of the fifth, the Chicago crowd and players, led by pitcher <a href="Guy%20Bush">Guy Bush</a>, were screaming insults at Ruth. With the <a href="Count%20%28baseball%29">count</a> at two balls and one strike, Ruth gestured, possibly in the direction of <a href="center%20fielder">center field</a>, and after the next pitch (a strike), may have pointed there with one hand. Ruth hit the fifth pitch over the center field fence; estimates were that it traveled nearly . Whether or not Ruth intended to indicate where he planned to (and did) hit the ball, the incident has gone down in legend as <a href="Babe%20Ruth%27s%20called%20shot">Babe Ruth's called shot</a>. The Yankees won Game Three, and the following day clinched the Series with another victory. During that game, Bush hit Ruth on the arm with a pitch, causing words to be exchanged and provoking a game-winning Yankee rally.

Ruth remained productive in 1933, as he batted .301, with 34 home runs, 103 RBIs, and a league-leading 114 walks, as the Yankees finished in second place, seven games behind the Senators. Athletics manager <a href="Connie%20Mack">Connie Mack</a> selected him to play right field in the first <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>, held on July 6, 1933, at <a href="Comiskey%20Park">Comiskey Park</a> in Chicago. He hit the first home run in the All-Star Game's history, a two-run blast against <a href="Bill%20Hallahan">Bill Hallahan</a> during the third inning, which helped the AL win the game 4–2. During the final game of the 1933 season, as a publicity stunt organized by his team, Ruth was called upon and pitched a complete game victory against the Red Sox, his final appearance as a pitcher. Despite unremarkable pitching numbers, Ruth had a 5–0 record in five games for the Yankees, raising his career totals to 94–46.

In 1934, Ruth played in his last full season. By this time, years of high living were starting to catch up with him. His conditioning had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer field or run. He accepted a pay cut from Ruppert to $35,000, but was still the highest-paid player in the major leagues. He could still handle a bat, recording a .288 batting average with 22 home runs, statistics Reisler described as "merely mortal". Ruth was selected to the AL All-Star team for the second consecutive year, even though he was in the twilight of his career. During the game, New York Giants pitcher <a href="Carl%20Hubbell">Carl Hubbell</a> struck out Ruth and four other future <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall-of-Famers</a> consecutively. The Yankees finished second again, seven games behind the Tigers.

Although Ruth knew he was nearly finished as a player, he desired to remain in baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated that he was not yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, and <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.

Just before the 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth the manager of the Yankees' top minor-league team, the <a href="Newark%20Bears%20%28International%20League%29">Newark Bears</a>, but he was talked out of it by his wife, <a href="Claire%20Merritt%20Ruth">Claire</a>, and his business manager, Christy Walsh. Shortly afterward, Tigers owner <a href="Frank%20Navin">Frank Navin</a> made a proposal to Ruppert and Barrow—if the Yankees traded Ruth to Detroit, Navin would name Ruth player-manager. Navin believed Ruth would not only bring a winning attitude to a team that had not finished higher than third since 1923, but would also revive the Tigers' sagging attendance figures. Navin asked Ruth to come to Detroit for an interview. However, Ruth balked, since Walsh had already arranged for him to take part in a celebrity golf tournament in Hawaii. Ruth and Navin negotiated over the phone while Ruth was in Hawaii, but those talks foundered when Navin refused to give Ruth a portion of the Tigers' box office proceeds.

Early in the 1934 season, Ruth began openly campaigning to become manager of the Yankees. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always supported McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By the end of the season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. For his part, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama and hard feelings when the time came.

During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth circled the world with his wife, including a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player <a href="Alan%20Fairfax">Alan Fairfax</a>, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted that he could not have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.

Also during the offseason, Ruppert had been sounding out the other clubs in hopes of finding one that would be willing to take Ruth as a manager and/or a player. However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth. However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.

While the barnstorming tour was under way, Ruppert began negotiating with Boston Braves owner Judge <a href="Emil%20Fuchs%20%28baseball%29">Emil Fuchs</a>, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. Although the Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing fourth in the National League in both 1933 and 1934, the team performed poorly at the box office. Unable to afford the rent at <a href="Braves%20Field">Braves Field</a>, Fuchs had considered holding dog races there when the Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis. After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. Ruppert had stated that he would not release Ruth to go to another team as a full-time player. For this reason, it was announced that Ruth would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper <a href="Bill%20McKechnie">Bill McKechnie</a>. In a long letter to Ruth a few days before the press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth succeeding McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936. Ruppert called the deal "the greatest opportunity Ruth ever had".

There was considerable attention as Ruth reported for spring training. He did not hit his first home run of the spring until after the team had left Florida, and was beginning the road north in Savannah. He hit two in an exhibition against the Bears. Amid much press attention, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, including five of New England's six state governors, Ruth accounted for all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 defeat of the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a>, hitting a two-run home run, singling to drive in a third run and later in the inning scoring the fourth. Although age and weight had slowed him, he made a running catch in left field that sportswriters deemed the defensive highlight of the game.

Ruth had two hits in the second game of the season, but it quickly went downhill both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves losing most games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.

Ruth soon realized that Fuchs had deceived him, and had no intention of making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of "his" money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.

By the end of the first month of the season, Ruth concluded he was finished even as a part-time player. As early as May 12, he asked Fuchs to let him retire. Ultimately, Fuchs persuaded Ruth to remain at least until after the <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> doubleheader in Philadelphia. In the interim was a western road trip, at which the rival teams had scheduled days to honor him. In Chicago and St. Louis, Ruth performed poorly, and his batting average sank to .155, with only three home runs. In the first two games in Pittsburgh, Ruth had only one hit, though a long fly caught by <a href="Paul%20Waner">Paul Waner</a> probably would have been a home run in any other ballpark besides <a href="Forbes%20Field">Forbes Field</a>.

Ruth played in the third game of the Pittsburgh series on May 25, 1935, and added one more tale to his playing legend. Ruth went 4-for-4, including three home runs, though the Braves lost the game 11–7. The last two were off Ruth's old Cubs nemesis, Guy Bush. The final home run, both of the game and of Ruth's career, sailed over the upper deck in right field and out of the ballpark, the first time anyone had hit a fair ball completely out of Forbes Field. Ruth was urged to make this his last game, but he had given his word to Fuchs and played in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. The first game of the doubleheader in Philadelphia—the Braves lost both—was his final major league appearance. Ruth retired on June 2 after an argument with Fuchs. He finished 1935 with a .181 average—easily his worst as a full-time position player—and the final six of his 714 home runs. The Braves, 10–27 when Ruth left, finished 38–115, at .248 the worst winning percentage in modern National League history. Insolvent like his team, Fuchs gave up control of the Braves before the end of the season; the National League took over the franchise at the end of the year.

Although Fuchs had given Ruth his unconditional release, no major league team expressed an interest in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement and the end of the 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner <a href="Alva%20Bradley">Alva Bradley</a> replied negatively.

The writer Creamer believed Ruth was unfairly treated in never being given an opportunity to manage a major league club. The author believed there was not necessarily a relationship between personal conduct and managerial success, noting that <a href="John%20McGraw%20%28baseball%29">McGraw</a>, <a href="Billy%20Martin">Billy Martin</a>, and <a href="Bobby%20Valentine">Bobby Valentine</a> were winners despite character flaws. Team owners and general managers assessed Ruth's flamboyant personal habits as a reason to exclude him from a managerial job; Barrow said of him, "How can he manage other men when he can't even manage himself?"

Ruth played much golf and in a few exhibition baseball games, demonstrating a continuing ability to draw large crowds. This appeal contributed to the Dodgers hiring him as first base coach in 1938. But Brooklyn general manager <a href="Larry%20MacPhail">Larry MacPhail</a> made it clear when Ruth was hired that he would not be considered for the manager's job if, as expected, <a href="Burleigh%20Grimes">Burleigh Grimes</a> retired at the end of the season. Although much was said about what Ruth could teach the younger players, in practice, his duties were to appear on the field in uniform and encourage base runners—he was not called upon to relay signs. He got along well with everyone except team captain <a href="Leo%20Durocher">Leo Durocher</a>, who was hired as Grimes' replacement at season's end. Ruth returned to retirement, never again to work in baseball.

On July 4, 1939, Ruth spoke on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium as members of the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, forced into premature retirement by <a href="Amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">ALS disease</a>, which would kill him in two years. The next week, Ruth went to <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>, for the formal opening of the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>. Three years earlier he was one of the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201936">first five players</a> elected to it. As radio broadcasts of baseball became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers. During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army–Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball, contacting new Yankees boss MacPhail, but was sent a rejection letter.

Ruth met Helen Woodford (1897–1929), by some accounts, in a coffee shop in Boston where she was a waitress, and they were married on October 17, 1914; he was 19 and she was 17. Although Ruth later claimed to have been married in <a href="Elkton%2C%20Maryland">Elkton, Maryland</a>, records show that they were married in <a href="Ellicott%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ellicott City</a> at <a href="Saint%20Paul%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Ellicott%20City%2C%20Maryland%29">St. Paul's Catholic Church</a>. They adopted a daughter, <a href="Dorothy%20Ruth">Dorothy</a> (1921–1989), in 1921. Ruth and Helen separated around 1925, reportedly due to his repeated <a href="Adultery">infidelities</a>. Their last public appearance together came during the 1926 World Series. Helen died in January 1929 at age 31 in a house fire in <a href="Watertown%2C%20Massachusetts">Watertown, Massachusetts</a>, in a house owned by Edward Kinder, a dentist with whom she had been living as "Mrs. Kinder". In her book, "My Dad, the Babe", Dorothy claimed that she was Ruth's biological child by a mistress named Juanita Jennings. She died in 1989.

On April 17, 1929, only three months after the death of his first wife, Ruth married actress and model <a href="Claire%20Merritt%20Hodgson">Claire Merritt Hodgson</a> (1897–1976) and adopted her daughter Julia; he was 34 and she was 31. It was the second and final marriage for both parties. By one account, Julia and Dorothy were, through no fault of their own, the reason for the seven-year rift in Ruth's relationship with teammate Lou Gehrig. Sometime in 1932, Gehrig's mother, during a conversation which she assumed was private, remarked, "It's a shame [Claire] doesn't dress Dorothy as nicely as she dresses her own daughter." When the comment inevitably got back to Ruth, he angrily told Gehrig to tell his mother to mind her own business. Gehrig in turn took offense at what he perceived as Ruth's comment about his mother. The two men reportedly never spoke off the field until they reconciled at Yankee Stadium on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day in 1939.

Although Ruth was married through most of his baseball career, when Colonel Huston asked him to tone down his lifestyle, the player said, "I'll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier, but not for you, fifty thousand dollars, or two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars will I give up women. They're too much fun."

As early as the war years, doctors had cautioned Ruth to take better care of his health, and he grudgingly followed their advice, limiting his drinking and not going on a proposed trip to support the troops in the South Pacific. In 1946, Ruth began experiencing severe pain over his left eye, and had difficulty swallowing. In November 1946, he entered French Hospital in New York for tests, which revealed that Ruth had an inoperable <a href="cancer">malignant tumor</a> at the base of his skull and in his neck. It was a lesion known as <a href="nasopharyngeal%20carcinoma">nasopharyngeal carcinoma</a>, or "lymphoepithelioma." His name and fame gave him access to experimental treatments, and he was one of the first cancer patients to receive both drugs and radiation treatment simultaneously. He was discharged from the hospital in February, having lost , and went to Florida to recuperate. He returned to New York and Yankee Stadium after the season started. The new commissioner, <a href="Happy%20Chandler">Happy Chandler</a> (Judge Landis had died in 1944), proclaimed April 27, 1947, Babe Ruth Day around the major leagues, with the most significant observance to be at Yankee Stadium. A number of teammates and others spoke in honor of Ruth, who briefly addressed the crowd of almost 60,000.

Around this time, developments in <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors had not told Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a <a href="folic%20acid">folic acid</a> derivative; he may have been the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on <a href="American%20Legion%20Baseball">American Legion Baseball</a>. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.

The improvement was only a temporary remission, and by late 1947, Ruth was unable to help with the writing of his autobiography, "The Babe Ruth Story", which was almost entirely ghostwritten. In and out of the hospital in Manhattan, he left for Florida in February 1948, doing what activities he could. After six weeks he returned to New York to appear at a book-signing party. He also traveled to California to witness the filming of the book.

On June 5, 1948, a "gaunt and hollowed out" Ruth visited <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> to donate a manuscript of "The Babe Ruth Story" to its library. On June 13, Ruth visited Yankee Stadium for the final time in his life, appearing at the 25th anniversary celebrations of "The House that Ruth Built". By this time he had lost much weight and had difficulty walking. Introduced along with his surviving teammates from 1923, Ruth used a bat as a cane. <a href="Nat%20Fein">Nat Fein</a>'s photo of Ruth taken from behind, standing near home plate and facing "Ruthville" (right field) became one of baseball's most famous and widely circulated photographs, and won the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>.

Ruth made one final trip on behalf of American Legion Baseball, then entered <a href="Memorial%20Sloan%E2%80%93Kettering%20Cancer%20Center">Memorial Hospital</a>, where he would die. He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it. He was able to leave the hospital for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film "<a href="The%20Babe%20Ruth%20Story">The Babe Ruth Story</a>". Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was <a href="National%20League">National League</a> president and future <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">Commissioner of Baseball</a> <a href="Ford%20Frick">Ford Frick</a>. "Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard", Frick said years later.

Thousands of New Yorkers, including many children, stood vigil outside the hospital in Ruth's final days. On August 16, 1948, at 8:01 p.m., Ruth died in his sleep at the age of 53. His open casket was placed on display in the rotunda of Yankee Stadium, where it remained for two days; 77,000 people filed past to pay him tribute. His funeral Mass took place at <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%20%28New%20York%29">St. Patrick's Cathedral</a>; a crowd estimated at 75,000 waited outside. Ruth was buried on a hillside in Section 25 at the <a href="Gate%20of%20Heaven%20Cemetery">Gate of Heaven Cemetery</a> in <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20New%20York">Hawthorne, New York</a>. An epitaph by <a href="Cardinal%20Spellman">Cardinal Spellman</a> appears on his headstone. His second wife, <a href="Claire%20Merritt%20Ruth">Claire Merritt Ruth</a>, would be interred with him 28 years later in 1976.

On April 19, 1949, the Yankees unveiled a granite monument in Ruth's honor in center field of Yankee Stadium. The monument was located <a href="ground%20rules">in the field of play</a> next to a flagpole and similar tributes to Huggins and Gehrig until the stadium was remodeled from 1974 to 1975, which resulted in the outfield fences moving inward and enclosing the monuments from the playing field. This area was known thereafter as <a href="Monument%20Park%20%28Yankee%20Stadium%29">Monument Park</a>. Yankee Stadium, "the House that Ruth Built", was replaced after the 2008 season with a new <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a> across the street from the old one; Monument Park was subsequently moved to the new venue behind the center field fence. Ruth's uniform number 3 has been <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> by the Yankees, and he is one of five Yankees players or managers to have a granite monument within the stadium.

The Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum is located at 216 Emory Street, a Baltimore row house where Ruth was born, and three blocks west of <a href="Oriole%20Park%20at%20Camden%20Yards">Oriole Park at Camden Yards</a>, where the AL's <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> play. The property was restored and opened to the public in 1973 by the non-profit Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation, Inc. Ruth's widow, Claire, his two daughters, Dorothy and Julia, and his sister, Mamie, helped select and install exhibits for the museum.

Ruth was the first baseball star to be the subject of overwhelming adulation by the public. Baseball had been known for star players such as Ty Cobb and "Shoeless Joe" Jackson, but both men had uneasy relations with fans, in Cobb's case sometimes marked by violence. Ruth's biographers agreed that he benefited from the timing of his ascension to "Home Run King", with a country hit hard by both the war and the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a> longing for something to help put these traumas behind it. He also resonated in a country which felt, in the aftermath of the war, that it took second place to no one. Montville argues that as a larger-than-life figure capable of unprecedented athletic feats in the nation's largest city, Ruth became an icon of the significant social changes which marked the early 1920s. Glenn Stout notes in his history of the Yankees, "Ruth was New York incarnate—uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, out of scale, and absolutely unstoppable".

Ruth became such a symbol of the United States during his lifetime that during World War II, Japanese soldiers yelled in English, "To hell with Babe Ruth", to anger American soldiers. Ruth replied that he hoped that "every Jap that mention[ed] my name gets shot". Creamer recorded that "Babe Ruth transcended sport, moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages". Wagenheim stated, "He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable." According to Glenn Stout, "Ruth's home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for. A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible."

Ruth's penchant for hitting home runs altered how baseball is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games by getting a runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the <a href="bunt%20%28baseball%29">bunt</a>, and the <a href="hit%20and%20run%20%28baseball%29">hit and run</a>. Advocates of what was dubbed "inside baseball", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on the purity of the game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, "settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star." Bill James noted, "When the owners discovered that the fans "liked" to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace [in the Black Sox Scandal], then there was no turning back." While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.

According to contemporary sportswriter <a href="Grantland%20Rice">Grantland Rice</a>, only two sports figures of the 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer <a href="Jack%20Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a> and racehorse <a href="Man%20o%27%20War">Man o' War</a>. One of the factors that contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something better than anyone else in the world. Montville noted that "the fog [surrounding his childhood] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility." Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler noted that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a> and <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>, generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.

Creamer termed Ruth "a unique figure in the social history of the United States". Ruth has even entered the language: a dominant figure in a field, whether within or outside sports, is often referred to as "the Babe Ruth" of that field. Similarly, "Ruthian" has come to mean in sports, "colossal, dramatic, prodigious, magnificent; with great power."

In 2006, Montville noted that more books have been written about Ruth than any other member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. At least five of these books (including Creamer's and Wagenheim's) were written in 1973 and 1974. The books were timed to capitalize on the increase in public interest in Ruth as <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Henry Aaron</a> approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974. As he approached Ruth's record, Aaron stated, "I can't remember a day this year or last when I did not hear the name of Babe Ruth."

Montville suggested that Ruth is probably even more popular today than he was when his career home run record was broken by Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, to the delight of the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on "<a href="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>" and "<a href="Baseball%20Tonight">Baseball Tonight</a>" each evening during the season. The questions of <a href="performance-enhancing%20drug">performance-enhancing drug</a> use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.

Ruth has been named the greatest baseball player of all time in various surveys and rankings. In 1998, "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>" ranked him number one on the list of "Baseball's 100 Greatest Players". In 1999, baseball fans named Ruth to the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Century%20Team">Major League Baseball All-Century Team</a>. He was named baseball's Greatest Player Ever in a ballot commemorating the 100th anniversary of professional baseball, in 1969. The <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> reported in 1993 that <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athletes in America. In a 1999 ESPN poll, he was ranked as the second-greatest U.S. athlete of the century, behind <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>. In 1983, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> honored Ruth with the issuance of a twenty-cent stamp.

Several of the most expensive items of <a href="sports%20memorabilia">sports memorabilia</a> and baseball memorabilia ever sold at auction are associated with Ruth. As of November 2016, the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold is Ruth's 1920 Yankees jersey, which sold for $4,415,658 in 2012. The <a href="baseball%20bat">bat</a> with which he hit the first home run at Yankee Stadium is in "<a href="The%20Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records">The Guinness Book of World Records</a>" as the most expensive baseball bat sold at auction, having fetched $1,265,000 on December 2, 2004. A hat of Ruth's from the 1934 season set a record for a <a href="baseball%20cap">baseball cap</a> when <a href="David%20Wells">David Wells</a> sold it at auction for $537,278 in 2012. In 2017, <a href="Charlie%20Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> sold Ruth's 1927 World Series ring for $2,093,927 at auction. It easily broke the record for a <a href="championship%20ring">championship ring</a> previously set when <a href="Julius%20Erving">Julius Erving</a>'s <a href="1974%20ABA%20Playoffs">1974 ABA championship</a> ring sold for $460,741 in 2011.
One long-term survivor of the craze over Ruth may be the <a href="Baby%20Ruth">Baby Ruth</a> candy bar. The original company to market the confectionery, the Curtis Candy Company, maintained that the bar was named after <a href="Ruth%20Cleveland">Ruth Cleveland</a>, daughter of former president <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. She died in 1904 and the bar was first marketed in 1921, at the height of the craze over the slugger. The slugger later sought to market candy bearing his name; he was refused a trademark because of the Baby Ruth bar. Corporate files from 1921 are no longer extant; the brand has changed hands several times and is now owned by the <a href="Nestl%C3%A9">Nestlé</a> company. The Ruth estate licensed his likeness for use in an advertising campaign for Baby Ruth in 1995. Due to a marketing arrangement, in 2005, the Baby Ruth bar became the official candy bar of Major League Baseball.

Montville noted the continuing relevance of Babe Ruth in American culture, more than three-quarters of a century after he last swung a bat in a major league game:

Barge

A barge is a flat-bottomed <a href="boat">boat</a>, built mainly for <a href="river">river</a> and <a href="canal">canal</a> transport of heavy goods. Some barges are not self-propelled and must be towed or pushed by <a href="towboat">towboat</a>s, canal barges or towed by draft animals on an adjacent <a href="towpath">towpath</a>. Barges contended with the <a href="railway">railway</a> in the early <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, but <a href="history%20of%20the%20British%20canal%20system">were outcompeted</a> in the carriage of high-value items due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of <a href="Rail%20transport">railways</a>.

"Barge" is attested from 1300, from <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "barge", from <a href="Vulgar%20Latin">Vulgar Latin</a> "barga". The word originally could refer to any small boat; the modern meaning arose around 1480. "<a href="barque">Bark</a>" "small ship" is attested from 1420, from Old French "barque", from Vulgar Latin "barca" (400 AD). The more precise meaning "three-masted ship" arose in the 17th century, and often takes the French spelling for disambiguation. Both are probably derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "barica", from , from "bāri" "small boat", <a href="hieroglyphic">hieroglyphic</a> Egyptian and similar "ba-y-r" for "basket-shaped boat". By extension, the term "embark" literally means to board the kind of boat called a "barque".

The long pole used to maneuver or propel a barge has given rise to the saying "I wouldn't touch that [subject/thing] with a barge pole."

On the <a href="Canals%20of%20Great%20Britain">British canal system</a>, the term 'barge' is used to describe a boat wider than a <a href="narrowboat">narrowboat</a>, and the people who move barges are often known as <a href="lightermen">lightermen</a>. In the United States, deckhands perform the labor and are supervised by a leadman or the mate. The captain and pilot steer the towboat, which pushes one or more barges held together with rigging, collectively called 'the tow'. The crew live aboard the towboat as it travels along the inland river system or the intracoastal waterways. These towboats travel between ports and are also called line-haul boats.

Poles are used on barges to fend off the barge as it nears other vessels or a wharf. These are often called 'pike poles'.

Barges are used today for low-value bulk items, as the cost of hauling goods by barge is very low. Barges are also used for very heavy or bulky items; a typical American barge measures , and can carry up to about of cargo. The most common European barge measures and can carry up to about .

As an example, on June 26, 2006, a <a href="Cracking%20%28chemistry%29">catalytic cracking</a> unit reactor was shipped by barge from the <a href="Tulsa%20Port%20of%20Catoosa">Tulsa Port of Catoosa</a> in <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> to a refinery in <a href="Pascagoula%2C%20Mississippi">Pascagoula, Mississippi</a>. Extremely large objects are normally shipped in sections and assembled onsite, but shipping an assembled unit reduced costs and avoided reliance on construction labor at the delivery site (which in this case was still recovering from <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>). Of the reactor's journey, only about were traveled overland, from the final port to the refinery.

Self-propelled barges may be used as such when traveling downstream or upstream in placid waters; they are operated as an unpowered barge, with the assistance of a tugboat, when traveling upstream in faster waters. Canal barges are usually made for the particular canal in which they will operate.

Many barges, primarily <a href="Dutch%20barge">Dutch barge</a>s, which were originally designed for carrying cargo along the canals of Europe, are no longer large enough to compete in this industry with larger newer vessels. Many of these barges have been renovated and are now used as luxury <a href="hotel%20barge">hotel barge</a>s carrying holidaymakers along the same canals on which they once carried grain or coal.

In primitive regions today and in all pre-development (lacking highways or railways) regions worldwide in times before industrial development and highways, barges were the predominant and most efficient means of inland transportation in many regions. This holds true today, for many areas of the world.

In such pre-industrialized, or poorly developed infrastructure regions, many barges are purpose-designed to be powered on waterways by long slender poles — thereby becoming known on American waterways as poleboats as the extensive west of North America was settled using the vast tributary river systems of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a>. Poleboats use muscle power of "walkers" along the sides of the craft pushing a pole against the streambed, canal or lake bottom to move the vessel where desired. In settling the American west it was generally faster to navigate downriver from <a href="Brownsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Brownsville, Pennsylvania</a>, to the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> confluence with the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> and then pole upriver against the current to St. Louis than to travel overland on the rare primitive dirt roads for many decades after the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>.

Once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads reached Chicago, that time dynamic changed, and American poleboats became less common, relegated to smaller rivers and more remote streams. On the Mississippi riverine system today, including that of other sheltered waterways, industrial barge trafficking in bulk raw materials such as coal, coke, timber, iron ore and other minerals is extremely common; in the developed world using huge cargo barges that connect in groups and trains-of-barges in ways that allow cargo volumes and weights considerably greater than those used by pioneers of modern barge systems and methods in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>.
Such barges need to be towed by <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s or pushed by <a href="towboat">towboat</a>s. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on a waterway adjacent <a href="towpath">towpath</a> were of fundamental importance in the early <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, whose major early engineering projects were efforts to build <a href="viaduct">viaduct</a>s, <a href="navigable%20aqueduct">aqueducts</a> and especially canals to fuel and feed raw materials to nascent factories in the early industrial takeoff (18th century) and take their goods to ports and cities for distribution.

The barge and canal system contended favourably with the <a href="railway">railway</a>s in the early <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> before around the 1850s–1860s — for example, the <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a> in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> state is credited by economic historians with giving the growth boost needed for <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to eclipse <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> as America's largest port and city — but such canal systems with their locks, need for maintenance and dredging, pumps and sanitary issues <a href="history%20of%20the%20British%20canal%20system">were eventually outcompeted</a> in the carriage of high-value items by the railways due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of <a href="rail%20transport">rail transport</a>. Barge and canal systems were nonetheless of great, perhaps even primary, economic importance until after the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> in Europe, particularly in the more developed nations of the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and especially <a href="UK">Great Britain</a> which more or less made the system characteristically its own.

Nowadays, custom built special purpose equipment called modular barges which is extensively used in survey, mapping, laying and burial of Sub Sea optic fibre cables worldwide and other support services. its a cost effective tool and is able to carry out tasks with much ease and precision.

British English

British English is the <a href="English%20language">English language</a> as spoken and written in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective "wee" is almost exclusively used in parts of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and occasionally <a href="Yorkshire%20dialect">Yorkshire</a>, whereas "little" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in written English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term British English. The forms of <a href="Spoken%20language">spoken</a> English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the "Oxford Guide to World English", British English shares "all the ambiguities and tensions in the word '<a href="British%20people">British</a>' and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity".

When distinguished from <a href="American%20English">American English</a>, the term "British English" is sometimes used broadly as a synonym for <a href="English%20in%20the%20Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">the various varieties of English</a> spoken in some member states of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>.

<a href="English%20language">English</a> is a <a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">West Germanic language</a> that originated from the <a href="Anglo-Frisian">Anglo-Frisian</a> <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s brought to Britain by <a href="Germanic%20tribes">Germanic settlers</a> from various parts of what is now northwest <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and the northern <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. The resident population at this time was generally speaking <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Common Brittonic</a>—the insular variety of <a href="continental%20Celtic">continental Celtic</a>, which was influenced by the <a href="Roman%20army">Roman</a> occupation. This group of languages (<a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>, <a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish</a>, <a href="Cumbric">Cumbric</a>) cohabited alongside <a href="English%20language">English</a> into the modern period, but due to their remoteness from the <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a>, influence on English was <a href="Lists%20of%20English%20words%20of%20Celtic%20origin">notably limited</a>. However, the degree of influence remains debated, and it has recently been argued that its grammatical influence accounts for the substantial innovations noted between English and the other West Germanic languages. Initially, <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> Kingdoms of England. One of these dialects, <a href="Late%20West%20Saxon">Late West Saxon</a>, eventually came to dominate. The original <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English language</a> was then influenced by two waves of invasion: the first was by speakers of the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family, who conquered and colonised parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second was the <a href="Normans">Normans</a> in the 11th century, who spoke <a href="Old%20Norman">Old Norman</a> and ultimately developed an English variety of this called <a href="Anglo-Norman%20language">Anglo-Norman</a>. These two invasions caused English to become "mixed" to some degree (though it was never a truly <a href="mixed%20language">mixed language</a> in the strictest sense of the word; mixed languages arise from the cohabitation of speakers of different languages, who develop a hybrid tongue for basic communication).

The more idiomatic, concrete and descriptive English is, the more it is from Anglo-Saxon origins. The more intellectual and abstract English is, the more it contains <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a> influences e.g. swine (like the Germanic schwein) is the animal in the field bred by the occupied Anglo-Saxons and pork (like the French porc) is the animal at the table eaten by the occupying Normans

Cohabitation with the Scandinavians resulted in a significant grammatical simplification and lexical enrichment of the <a href="Anglo-Frisian%20languages">Anglo-Frisian</a> core of English; the later Norman occupation led to the grafting onto that Germanic core of a more elaborate layer of words from the Romance branch of the European languages. This Norman influence entered English largely through the courts and government. Thus, English developed into a <a href="loanword">"borrowing" language</a> of great flexibility and with a huge <a href="vocabulary">vocabulary</a>.

<a href="List%20of%20dialects%20of%20the%20English%20language%23Europe">Dialects</a> and <a href="Regional%20accents%20of%20English">accents</a> vary amongst the four <a href="countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">countries of the United Kingdom</a>, as well as within the countries themselves.

The major divisions are normally classified as <a href="English%20language%20in%20England">English English</a> (or English as spoken in England, which encompasses <a href="Southern%20English%20English">Southern English</a> dialects, <a href="West%20Country%20English">West Country</a> dialects, <a href="East%20Midlands%20English">East</a> and <a href="West%20Midlands%20English">West Midlands English</a> dialects and <a href="English%20in%20northern%20England">Northern English</a> dialects), <a href="Ulster%20English">Ulster English</a> in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="Welsh%20English">Welsh English</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh language</a>), and <a href="Scottish%20English">Scottish English</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="Scots%20language">Scots language</a>). The various British dialects also differ in the words that they have borrowed from other languages. Around the middle of the 15th century, there were points where within the 5 major dialects there were almost 500 ways to spell the same the word "though".

Following its last major <a href="survey%20of%20English%20Dialects">survey of English Dialects</a> (1949–1950), the <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">University of Leeds</a> has started work on a new project. In May 2007 the <a href="Arts%20and%20Humanities%20Research%20Council">Arts and Humanities Research Council</a> awarded a grant to Leeds to study British regional dialects.

The team are sifting through a large collection of examples of regional slang words and phrases turned up by the "Voices project" run by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, in which they invited the public to send in examples of English still spoken throughout the country. The BBC Voices project also collected hundreds of news articles about how the British speak English from swearing through to items on language schools. This information will also be collated and analysed by Johnson's team both for content and for where it was reported. "Perhaps the most remarkable finding in the Voices study is that the English language is as diverse as ever, despite our increased mobility and constant exposure to other accents and dialects through TV and radio". When discussing the award of the grant in 2007, Leeds University stated:
Most people in Britain speak with a regional accent or dialect. However, about 2% of Britons speak with an accent called <a href="Received%20Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a> (also called as "the Queen's English", "Oxford English" and "<a href="BBC">BBC</a> English"), that is essentially region-less. It derives from a mixture of the Midlands and Southern dialects spoken in London in the early modern period. It is frequently used as a model for teaching English to foreign learners.

In the South East there are significantly different accents; the <a href="Cockney">Cockney</a> accent spoken by some East Londoners is strikingly different from Received Pronunciation (RP). The Cockney <a href="rhyming%20slang">rhyming slang</a> can be (and was initially intended to be) difficult for outsiders to understand, although the extent of its use is often somewhat exaggerated.

<a href="Estuary%20English">Estuary English</a> has been gaining prominence in recent decades: it has some features of RP and some of Cockney. In London itself, the broad local accent is still changing, partly influenced by Caribbean speech. Immigrants to the UK in recent decades have brought many more languages to the country. Surveys started in 1979 by the <a href="Inner%20London%20Education%20Authority">Inner London Education Authority</a> discovered over 100 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city's schoolchildren. As a result, <a href="London">London</a>ers speak with a mixture of accents, depending on ethnicity, neighbourhood, class, age, upbringing, and sundry other factors.

Since the mass internal <a href="immigration">immigration</a> to <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a> in the 1940s and its position between several major accent regions, it has become a source of various accent developments. In Northampton the older accent has been influenced by overspill Londoners. There is an accent known locally as the <a href="Kettering">Kettering</a> accent, which is a transitional accent between the <a href="East%20Midlands">East Midlands</a> and <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>n. It is the last southern Midlands accent to use the broad "a" in words like "bath"/"grass" (i.e. barth/grarss). Conversely "crass"/"plastic" use a slender "a". A few miles northwest in Leicestershire the slender "a" becomes more widespread generally. In the town of <a href="Corby">Corby</a>, north, one can find Corbyite, which unlike the Kettering accent, is largely influenced by the West Scottish accent.

In addition, most British people can to some degree temporarily "swing" their accent towards a more neutral form of English at will, to reduce difficulty where very different accents are involved, or when speaking to foreigners.

Phonological features characteristic of British English revolve around the pronunciation of the letter R, as well as the dental plosive T and some diphthongs specific to this dialect.

In a number of forms of spoken British English, it is common for the phoneme to be realised as a <a href="glottal%20stop">glottal stop</a> when it is in the intervocalic position, in a process called <a href="T-glottalisation">T-glottalisation</a>. Once regarded as a Cockney feature, it has become much more widespread. It is still stigmatised when used in words like "later", but becoming very widespread at the end of words such as "not" (as in no interested). Other consonants subject to this usage in Cockney English are "p", as in paer and "k" as in baer.

In most areas of Britain outside <a href="Scottish%20English">Scotland</a>, the consonant R is not pronounced if not followed by a vowel, lengthening the preceding vowel instead. This phenomenon is known as <a href="Rhoticity%20in%20English">non-rhoticity</a>. 
In these same areas, a tendency exists to insert an R between a word ending in a vowel and a next word beginning with a vowel. This is called the <a href="intrusive%20R">intrusive R</a>. This could be understood as a merger, in that words that once ended in an R and words that didn't are no longer treated differently.

British dialects differ on the extent of diphthongisation of long vowels, with southern varieties extensively turning them into diphthongs, and with northern dialects normally preserving many of them. As a comparison, North American varieties could be said to be in-between.

Long vowels /i:/ and /u:/ are diphthongised to [ɪi] and [ʊu] respectively (or, more technically, [ʏʉ], with a raised tongue), so that ee and oo in feed and food are pronounced with a movement. The diphthong [oʊ] is also pronounced with a greater movement, normally [əʊ], [əʉ] or [əɨ].

Long vowels /i:/ and /u:/ are usually preserved, and in several areas also /o:/ and /e:/, as in go and say (unlike other varieties of English, that change them to [oʊ] and [eɪ] respectively). Some areas go as far as not diphthongising medieval /i:/ and /u:/, that give rise to modern /aɪ/ and /aʊ/; that is, for example, in the traditional accent of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, 'out' will sound as 'oot', and in parts of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, 'my' will be pronounced as 'me'.

A tendency to drop <a href="grammatical%20number">grammatical number</a> in <a href="collective%20noun">collective noun</a>s, stronger in British English than in North American English, exists. This is namely treating them, that were once grammatically singular, as grammatically plural, that is: the perceived natural number prevails. This applies especially to nouns of institutions and groups made of many people.

The noun 'police', for example, undergoes this treatment:

A football team can be treated likewise:

Some dialects of British English, unlike <a href="American%20English">American English</a>, uses negative concords, also known as <a href="double%20negatives">double negatives</a>. Rather than changing a word or using a positive, words like nobody, not, nothing, and never would be used in the same sentence. While this does not occur in Standard English, it does occur in non-standard dialects. The double negation follows the idea of two different morphemes, one that causes the double negation, and one that is used for the point or the verb.

As with English around the world, the English language as used in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> is governed by convention rather than formal code: there is no body equivalent to the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20fran%C3%A7aise">Académie française</a> or the <a href="Real%20Academia%20Espa%C3%B1ola">Real Academia Española</a>. Dictionaries (for example, <a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, <a href="Longman%20Dictionary%20of%20Contemporary%20English">Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English</a>, <a href="Chambers%20Dictionary">Chambers Dictionary</a>, <a href="Collins%20Dictionary">Collins Dictionary</a>) record usage rather than attempting to prescribe it. In addition, vocabulary and usage change with time: words are freely borrowed from other languages and other strains of English, and <a href="neologisms">neologisms</a> are frequent.

For historical reasons dating back to the rise of <a href="London">London</a> in the 9th century, the form of language spoken in London and the <a href="East%20Midlands">East Midlands</a> became standard English within the Court, and ultimately became the basis for generally accepted use in the law, government, literature and education in Britain. The standardisation of British English is thought to be from both dialect leveling and a thought of social superiority. Speaking in the Standard dialect created class distinctions; those who did not speak the standard English would be considered of a lesser class or social status and often discounted or considered of a low intelligence. Another contribution to the standardisation of British English was the introduction of the printing press to England in the mid-15th century. In doing so, William Caxton enabled a common language and spelling to be dispersed among the entirety of England at a much faster rate.

<a href="Samuel%20Johnson%27s%20A%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20English%20Language">Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language</a> (1755) was a large step in the <a href="English-language%20spelling%20reform">English-language spelling reform</a>, where the purification of language focused on standardising both speech and spelling. By the early 20th century, British authors have produced numerous books intended as guides to English grammar and usage, a few of which have achieved sufficient acclaim to have remained in print for long periods and to have been reissued in new editions after some decades. These include, most notably of all, Fowler's <a href="Modern%20English%20Usage">Modern English Usage</a> and <a href="The%20Complete%20Plain%20Words">The Complete Plain Words</a> by <a href="Sir%20Ernest%20Gowers">Sir Ernest Gowers</a>.

Detailed guidance on many aspects of writing British English for publication is included in style guides issued by various publishers including <a href="The%20Times">The Times</a> newspaper, the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> and the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Press">Cambridge University Press</a>. The Oxford University Press guidelines were originally drafted as a single broadsheet page by Horace Henry Hart, and were at the time (1893) the first guide of their type in English; they were gradually expanded and eventually published, first as <a href="Hart%27s%20Rules">Hart's Rules</a>, and in 2002 as part of "The Oxford Manual of Style". Comparable in authority and stature to <a href="The%20Chicago%20Manual%20of%20Style">The Chicago Manual of Style</a> for published <a href="American%20English">American English</a>, the Oxford Manual is a fairly exhaustive standard for published British English that writers can turn to in the absence of specific guidance from their publishing house.

Battle

A battle is a <a href="combat">combat</a> in <a href="warfare">warfare</a> between two or more <a href="armed%20forces">armed forces</a>, or <a href="combatants">combatants</a>. A <a href="war">war</a> sometimes consists of many battles. Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment. A battle with only limited engagement between the forces and without decisive results is sometimes called a <a href="skirmish">skirmish</a>.

Wars and military campaigns are guided by <a href="military%20strategy">strategy</a>, whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as <a href="operational%20mobility">operational mobility</a>. German strategist <a href="Carl%20von%20Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a> stated that "the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war" was the essence of <a href="strategy">strategy</a>.

Battle is a <a href="loanword">loanword</a> from the <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "bataille", first attested in 1297, from <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> "battualia", meaning "exercise of soldiers and gladiators in fighting and fencing", from <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> (taken from Germanic) "battuere" "beat", from which the English word battery is also derived via <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> "batri".

The defining characteristic of the fight as a concept in <a href="Military%20science">Military science</a> has been a dynamic one through the course of military history, changing with the changes in the organisation, employment and technology of military forces.

While the English <a href="military%20historian">military historian</a> <a href="John%20Keegan">Sir John Keegan</a> suggested an ideal definition of battle as "something which happens between two <a href="army">armies</a> leading to the moral then physical disintegration of one or the other of them", the origins and outcomes of battles can rarely be summarized so neatly.

In general a battle during the 20th century was, and continues to be, defined by the combat between opposing forces representing major components of total forces committed to a <a href="military%20campaign">military campaign</a>, used to achieve specific <a href="military%20objective">military objective</a>s. Where the duration of the battle is longer than a week, it is often for reasons of <a href="Operations%20%28military%20staff%29">staff operational planning</a> called an "operation". Battles can be planned, <a href="meeting%20engagement">encountered</a>, or forced by one force on the other when the latter is unable to <a href="Withdrawal%20%28military%29">withdraw</a> from combat.

A battle always has as its purpose the reaching of a <a href="mission%20goal">mission goal</a> by use of military force. A victory in the battle is achieved when one of the opposing sides forces the other to abandon its mission, or to <a href="surrender%20%28military%29">surrender</a> its forces, or <a href="rout">rout</a>s the other, i.e., forces it to retreat or renders it militarily ineffective for further <a href="combat%20operation">combat operation</a>s. However, a battle may end in a <a href="Pyrrhic%20victory">Pyrrhic victory</a>, which ultimately favors the defeated party. If no resolution is reached in a battle, it can result in a <a href="No-win%20situation">stalemate</a>. A conflict in which one side is unwilling to reach a decision by a direct battle using <a href="conventional%20warfare">conventional warfare</a> often becomes an <a href="insurgency">insurgency</a>.

Until the 19th century the majority of battles were of short duration, many lasting a part of a day. (The <a href="Battle%20of%20Nations">Battle of Nations</a> (1813) and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> (1863) were exceptional in lasting three days.) This was mainly due to the difficulty of supplying <a href="Army">armies</a> in the field, or conducting <a href="night%20combat">night operations</a>. The means of prolonging a battle was typically by employment of <a href="siege%20warfare">siege warfare</a>. Improvements in <a href="transport">transport</a>ation and the sudden evolving of <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>, with its siege-like nature during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in the 20th century, lengthened the duration of battles to days and weeks. This created the requirement for <a href="Tour%20of%20duty">unit rotation</a> to prevent <a href="combat%20fatigue">combat fatigue</a>, with troops preferably not remaining in a combat area of operations for more than a month. Trench warfare had become largely obsolete in conflicts between advanced armies by the start of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>.

The use of the term "battle" in military history has led to its misuse when referring to almost any scale of combat, notably by strategic forces involving hundreds of thousands of troops that may be engaged in either a single battle at one time (<a href="Battle%20of%20Leipzig">Battle of Leipzig</a>) or multiple operations (<a href="Battle%20of%20Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a>). The space a battle occupies depends on the range of the <a href="weapon">weapon</a>s of the combatants. A "battle" in this broader sense may be of long duration and take place over a large area, as in the case of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> or the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>. Until the advent of <a href="artillery">artillery</a> and <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a>, battles were fought with the two sides within sight, if not reach, of each other. The depth of the battlefield has also increased in <a href="modern%20warfare">modern warfare</a> with inclusion of the supporting units in the rear areas; supply, artillery, medical personnel etc. often outnumber the front-line combat troops.

Battles are, on the whole, made up of a multitude of individual combats, <a href="skirmish">skirmish</a>es and small <a href="engagement%20%28military%29">engagement</a>s within the context of which the combatants will usually only experience a small part of the events of the battle's entirety. To the <a href="infantry">infantry</a>man, there may be little to distinguish between combat as part of a minor raid or as a major offensive, nor is it likely that he anticipates the future course of the battle; few of the British infantry who went over the top on the <a href="first%20day%20on%20the%20Somme">first day on the Somme</a>, July 1, 1916, would have anticipated that they would be fighting the same battle in five months' time. Conversely, some of the Allied infantry who had just dealt a crushing defeat to the French at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> fully expected to have to fight again the next day (at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wavre">Battle of Wavre</a>).

Battlespace is a unified strategy to integrate and combine <a href="armed%20forces">armed forces</a> for the <a href="military">military</a> <a href="Theater%20%28warfare%29">theatre of operations</a>, including <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Earth">air</a>, <a href="information">information</a>, <a href="Earth">land</a>, <a href="sea">sea</a> and <a href="space">space</a>. It includes the environment, factors and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission. This includes enemy and friendly <a href="armed%20forces">armed forces</a>; facilities; weather; terrain; and the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> within the operational areas and areas of interest.

Battles are decided by various factors. The number and quality of combatants and equipment, the skill of the <a href="commanders">commanders</a> of each army, and the terrain advantages are among the most prominent factors. A unit may charge with high morale but less discipline and still emerge victorious. This tactic was effectively used by the early <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Army">French Revolutionary Armies</a>.

Weapons and armour can be a decisive factor. On many occasions armies have achieved victories largely owing to the employment of more advanced weapons than those of their opponents. An extreme example was in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Omdurman">Battle of Omdurman</a>, in which a large army of Sudanese Mahdists armed in a traditional manner were destroyed by an Anglo-Egyptian force equipped with <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim gun</a>s.

On some occasions, simple weapons employed in an unorthodox fashion have proven advantageous, as with the <a href="Swiss%20pikemen">Swiss pikemen</a> who gained many victories through their ability to transform a traditionally defensive weapon into an offensive one. Likewise, the <a href="Zulus">Zulus</a> in the early 19th century were victorious in battles against their rivals in part because they adopted a new kind of spear, the <a href="iklwa">iklwa</a>. Even so, forces with inferior weapons have still emerged victorious at times, for example in the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a> and in the <a href="First%20Italo%E2%80%93Ethiopian%20War">First Italo–Ethiopian War</a>. Discipline within the troops is often of greater importance; at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alesia">Battle of Alesia</a>, the Romans were greatly outnumbered but won because of superior training. 
Battles can also be determined by terrain. Capturing high ground, for example, has been the central strategy in innumerable battles. An army that holds the high ground forces the enemy to climb, and thus wear themselves down. Areas of dense vegetation, such as jungles and forest, act as force-multipliers, of benefit to inferior armies. Arguably, terrain is of less importance in modern warfare, due to the advent of aircraft, though terrain is still vital for camouflage, especially for <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>.

Generals and commanders also play a decisive role during combat. <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>, <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, <a href="Khalid%20ibn%20Walid">Khalid ibn Walid</a>, <a href="Subutai">Subutai</a>, and <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> were all skilled generals and, consequently, their armies were extremely successful. An army that can trust the commands of their leaders with conviction in its success invariably has a higher morale than an army that doubts its every move. The British in the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>, for example, owed its success to the reputation of celebrated admiral <a href="Lord%20Nelson">Lord Nelson</a>.

Battles can be fought on land, at sea and, in the modern age, in the air. <a href="Naval%20battle">Naval battle</a>s have occurred since before the 5th century BC. Air battles have been far less common, due to their late conception, the most prominent being the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> in 1940. However, since the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> land or sea battles have come to rely on air support. Indeed, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>, five <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s were sunk without either fleet coming into direct contact.
There are numerous types of battles:


Battles frequently do not fit one particular type perfectly, and are usually hybrids of different types listed above.

A "decisive battle" is one of particular importance; often by bringing hostilities to an end, such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> or the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hattin">Battle of Hattin</a>, or as a turning point in the fortunes of the <a href="belligerent">belligerent</a>s, such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a>. A decisive battle can have <a href="political">political</a> as well as military impact, changing the balance of power or boundaries between countries. The concept of the "decisive battle" became popular with the publication in 1851 of <a href="Edward%20Creasy">Edward Creasy</a>'s "<a href="The%20Fifteen%20Decisive%20Battles%20of%20the%20World">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</a>". British <a href="military%20historian">military historian</a>s <a href="J.F.C.%20Fuller">J.F.C. Fuller</a> ("The Decisive Battles of the Western World") and <a href="B.H.%20Liddell%20Hart">B.H. Liddell Hart</a> ("Decisive Wars of History"), among many others, have written books in the style of Creasy's work.

There is an obvious difference in the way battles have been fought throughout time. Early battles were probably fought between rival hunting bands as disorganized mobs. However, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%2815th%20century%20BC%29">Battle of Megiddo</a>, the first reliably documented battle in the fifteenth century BC, actual discipline was instilled in both armies. However, during the many wars of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, <a href="barbarians">barbarians</a> continued using <a href="mob%20tactics">mob tactics</a>.

As the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> dawned, armies began to fight in highly disciplined lines. Each would follow the orders from their officers and fight as a single unit instead of individuals. Each army was successively divided into <a href="regiments">regiments</a>, <a href="battalions">battalions</a>, <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a>, and <a href="platoons">platoons</a>. These armies would march, line up, and fire in divisions.

<a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, on the other hand, did not fight in lines, utilizing instead guerrilla tactics. American colonists and European forces continued using disciplined lines, continuing into the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

A new style, during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, known as <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>, developed nearly half a century later. This also led to <a href="radio">radio</a> for communication between battalions. <a href="Chemical%20warfare">Chemical warfare</a> also emerged with the use of poisonous gas during World War I.

By <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the use of the smaller divisions, platoons and companies became much more important as precise operations became vital. Instead of the locked trench warfare of World War I, during World War II, a dynamic network of battles developed where small groups encountered other platoons. As a result, elite squads became much more recognized and distinguishable.

<a href="Maneuver%20warfare">Maneuver warfare</a> also developed with an astonishing pace with the advent of the <a href="tank">tank</a>, replacing the archaic cannons of the Enlightenment Age. Artillery has since gradually replaced the use of frontal troops. Modern battles now continue to resemble those of World War II, though prominent innovations have been added. Indirect combat through the use of aircraft and missiles now constitutes a large portion of wars in place of battles, where battles are now mostly reserved for capturing cities.

One significant difference of modern naval battles as opposed to earlier forms of combat is the use of <a href="marine%20%28military%29">marines</a>, which introduced amphibious warfare. Today, a marine is actually an infantry regiment that sometimes fights solely on land and is no longer tied to the navy. A good example of an old naval battle is the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Battle of Salamis</a>.

Most ancient naval battles were fought by fast ships using the <a href="battering%20ram">battering ram</a> to sink opposing fleets or steer close enough for boarding in hand-to-hand combat. Troops were often used to storm enemy ships as used by <a href="ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> and <a href="piracy">pirates</a>. This tactic was usually used by civilizations that could not beat the enemy with ranged weaponry.

Another invention in the late <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> was the use of <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a> by the Byzantines, which was used to set enemy fleets on fire. Empty demolition ships utilized the tactic to crash into opposing ships and set it afire with an explosion. After the invention of cannons, naval warfare became useful as support units for land warfare.

During the 19th century, the development of mines led to a new type of naval warfare. The <a href="ironclad">ironclad</a>, first used in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, resistant to cannons, soon made the wooden ship obsolete. The invention of military <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s, during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, brought naval warfare to both above and below the surface. With the development of military aircraft during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, battles were fought in the sky as well as below the ocean. <a href="Aircraft%20carriers">Aircraft carriers</a> have since become the central unit in naval warfare, acting as a mobile base for lethal aircraft.

Although the use of aircraft has for the most part always been used as a supplement to land or naval engagements, since their first major military use in World War I aircraft have increasingly taken on larger roles in warfare. During World War I, the primary use was for reconnaissance, and small-scale bombardment.

Aircraft began becoming much more prominent in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> and especially World War II. Aircraft design began specializing, primarily into two types: bombers, which carried explosive payloads to bomb land targets or ships; and fighter-interceptors, which were used to either intercept incoming aircraft or to escort and protect bombers (engagements between fighter aircraft were known as <a href="dog%20fights">dog fights</a>). Some of the more notable aerial battles in this period include the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>.

Another important use of aircraft came with the development of the <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>, which first became heavily used during the Vietnam War, and still continues to be widely used today to transport and augment ground forces.

Today, direct engagements between aircraft are rare – the most modern fighter-interceptors carry much more extensive bombing payloads, and are used to bomb precision land targets, rather than to fight other aircraft. Anti-aircraft batteries are used much more extensively to defend against incoming aircraft than interceptors. Despite this, aircraft today are much more extensively used as the primary tools for both army and navy, as evidenced by the prominent use of helicopters to transport and support troops, the use of aerial bombardment as the "first strike" in many engagements, and the replacement of the battleship with the aircraft carrier as the center of most modern navies.

Battles are usually named after some feature of the battlefield <a href="geography">geography</a>, such as the name of a town, forest or river, commonly prefixed "Battle of...". Occasionally battles are named after the date on which they took place, such as <a href="The%20Glorious%20First%20of%20June">The Glorious First of June</a>.

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> it was considered important to settle on a suitable name for a battle which could be used by the <a href="chronicler">chronicler</a>s. For example, after <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V of England</a> defeated a French army on October 25, 1415, he met with the senior French <a href="herald">herald</a> and they agreed to name the battle after the nearby <a href="castle">castle</a> and so it was called the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a>.

In other cases, the sides adopted different names for the same battle, such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gallipoli">Battle of Gallipoli</a> which is known in Turkey as the <a href="Battle%20of%20%C3%87anakkale">Battle of Çanakkale</a>. During the American Civil War, the Union tended to name the battles after the nearest watercourse, such as the Battle of Wilsons Creek and the Battle of Stones River, whereas the Confederates favoured the nearby towns, as in the Battles of Chancellorsville and Murfreesboro. Occasionally both names for the same battle entered the popular culture, such as the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>, which are also referred to as the First and Second Battle of Manassas.

Sometimes in desert warfare, there is no nearby town name to use; map coordinates gave the name to the <a href="Battle%20of%2073%20Easting">Battle of 73 Easting</a> in the <a href="First%20Gulf%20War">First Gulf War</a>.

Some place names have become <a href="synonymous">synonymous</a> with the battles that took place there, such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Passchendaele</a>, <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">the Alamo</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a>, or <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a>. <a href="Military%20operation">Military operation</a>s, many of which result in battle, are given <a href="codename">codename</a>s, which are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of the type or the location of the battle. <a href="Operation%20Market%20Garden">Operation Market Garden</a> and <a href="Operation%20Rolling%20Thunder">Operation Rolling Thunder</a> are examples of battles known by their military codenames.

When a battleground is the site of more than one battle in the same conflict, the instances are distinguished by <a href="ordinal%20number">ordinal number</a>, such as the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battles of Bull Run</a>. An extreme case are the twelve <a href="Battles%20of%20the%20Isonzo">Battles of the Isonzo</a>—<a href="First%20Battle%20of%20the%20Isonzo">First</a> to <a href="Twelfth%20Battle%20of%20the%20Isonzo">Twelfth</a>—between Italy and <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> during the First World War.

Some battles are named for the convenience of <a href="military%20historian">military historian</a>s so that periods of combat can be neatly distinguished from one another. Following the First World War, the British Battles Nomenclature Committee was formed to decide on standard names for all battles and subsidiary actions. To the soldiers who did the fighting, the distinction was usually academic; a soldier fighting at <a href="Beaumont%20Hamel">Beaumont Hamel</a> on November 13, 1916 was probably unaware he was taking part in what the committee would call the "<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ancre">Battle of the Ancre</a>".

Many combats are too small to merit a name. Terms such as "action", "skirmish", "firefight", "raid" or "offensive patrol" are used to describe small-scale battle-like encounters. These combats often take place within the time and space of a battle and while they may have an objective, they are not necessarily "decisive". Sometimes the soldiers are unable to immediately gauge the significance of the combat; in the aftermath of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>, some British officers were in doubt as to whether the day's events merited the title of "battle" or would be passed off as merely an "action".

Battles affect the individuals who take part, as well as the political actors. Personal effects of battle range from mild psychological issues to permanent and crippling injuries. Some battle-survivors have nightmares about the conditions they encountered, or abnormal reactions to certain sights or sounds. Some suffer <a href="Flashback%20%28psychological%20phenomenon%29">flashbacks</a>. Physical effects of battle can include scars, amputations, lesions, loss of bodily functions, blindness, paralysis — and death.

Battles also affect <a href="politics">politics</a>. A decisive battle can cause the losing side to surrender, while a <a href="Pyrrhic%20Victory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Asculum">Battle of Asculum</a> can cause the winning side to reconsider its long-term goals. Battles in <a href="civil%20wars">civil wars</a> have often decided the fate of <a href="monarchs">monarchs</a> or political factions. Famous examples include the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">War of the Roses</a>, as well as the <a href="Jacobite%20Uprisings">Jacobite Uprisings</a>. Battles also affect the commitment of one side or the other to the continuance of a war, for example the <a href="Battle%20of%20Incheon">Battle of Incheon</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hue">Battle of Hue</a> during the <a href="Tet%20Offensive">Tet Offensive</a>.

Botany

Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of <a href="plant">plant</a> life and a branch of <a href="biology">biology</a>. A botanist or plant scientist is a <a href="scientist">scientist</a> who specialises in this field. The term "botany" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word ("botanē") meaning "<a href="pasture">pasture</a>", "grass", or "<a href="fodder">fodder</a>"; is in turn derived from ("boskein"), "to feed" or "to graze". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of <a href="fungus">fungi</a> and <a href="algae">algae</a> by <a href="mycology">mycologists</a> and <a href="phycology">phycologists</a> respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the <a href="International%20Botanical%20Congress">International Botanical Congress</a>. Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="Embryophyte">land plants</a> of which some 391,000 species are <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plants</a> (including ca 369,000 species of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plants</a>), and ca 20,000 are <a href="bryophyte">bryophytes</a>.

Botany originated in prehistory as <a href="herbalism">herbalism</a> with the efforts of early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval <a href="physic%20garden">physic gardens</a>, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first <a href="botanical%20garden">botanical gardens</a> attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the <a href="Orto%20botanico%20di%20Padova">Padua botanical garden</a>. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of <a href="plant%20taxonomy">plant taxonomy</a>, and led in 1753 to the <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial system</a> of <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> that remains in use to this day.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of <a href="optical%20microscope">optical microscopy</a> and <a href="live%20cell%20imaging">live cell imaging</a>, <a href="electron%20microscopy">electron microscopy</a>, analysis of <a href="ploidy">chromosome number</a>, <a href="phytochemistry">plant chemistry</a> and the structure and function of <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s and other <a href="protein">protein</a>s. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular genetic analysis</a>, including <a href="genomics">genomics</a> and <a href="proteomics">proteomics</a> and <a href="DNA%20sequences">DNA sequences</a> to classify plants more accurately.

Modern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant <a href="Plant%20morphology">structure</a>, <a href="cell%20growth">growth</a> and differentiation, <a href="Plant%20reproduction">reproduction</a>, <a href="plant%20physiology%23Biochemistry%20of%20plants">biochemistry</a> and <a href="metabolism">primary metabolism</a>, <a href="phytochemistry">chemical products</a>, <a href="Plant%20morphology%23Development">development</a>, <a href="plant%20pathology">diseases</a>, <a href="phylogenetics">evolutionary relationships</a>, systematics, and <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">plant taxonomy</a>. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are <a href="molecular%20genetics">molecular genetics</a> and <a href="epigenetics">epigenetics</a>, which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of <a href="plant%20cell">plant cell</a>s and <a href="Tissue%20%28biology%29%23Plant%20tissues">tissues</a>. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing <a href="staple%20foods">staple foods</a>, materials such as timber, oil, rubber, fibre and drugs, in modern horticulture, agriculture and <a href="forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="plant%20propagation">plant propagation</a>, <a href="Plant%20breeding">breeding</a> and <a href="genetic%20modification">genetic modification</a>, in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in <a href="environmental%20management">environmental management</a>, and the maintenance of <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.

Botany originated as <a href="herbalism">herbalism</a>, the study and use of plants for their medicinal properties. Many records of the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> period date early botanical knowledge as far back as 10,000 years ago. This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, which make up much of the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> land today. The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic <a href="Avestan%20language">Avestan</a> writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.

Modern botany traces its roots back to <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a> specifically to <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> (c. 371–287 BC), a student of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> who invented and described many of its principles and is widely regarded in the <a href="scientific%20community">scientific community</a> as the "Father of Botany". His major works, "<a href="Historia%20Plantarum%20%28Theophrastus%29">Enquiry into Plants</a>" and "On the Causes of Plants", constitute the most important contributions to botanical science until the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, almost seventeen centuries later.

Another work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is "De Materia Medica", a five-volume encyclopedia about <a href="Herbalism">herbal medicine</a> written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist <a href="Pedanius%20Dioscorides">Pedanius Dioscorides</a>. "De Materia Medica" was widely read for more than 1,500 years. Important contributions from the <a href="Islamic%20Golden%20Age">medieval Muslim world</a> include <a href="Ibn%20Wahshiyya">Ibn Wahshiyya</a>'s "Nabatean Agriculture", <a href="Ab%C5%AB%20%E1%B8%A4an%C4%ABfa%20D%C4%ABnawar%C4%AB">Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī</a>'s (828–896) the "Book of Plants", and <a href="Ibn%20Bassal">Ibn Bassal</a>'s "The Classification of Soils". In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and <a href="Ibn%20al-Baitar">Ibn al-Baitar</a> (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.

In the mid-16th century, "<a href="botanical%20garden">botanical garden</a>s" were founded in a number of Italian universities – the <a href="Orto%20botanico%20di%20Padova">Padua botanical garden</a> in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These gardens continued the practical value of earlier "physic gardens", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for medical use. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford%20Botanic%20Garden">University of Oxford Botanic Garden</a> in 1621. Throughout this period, botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine.

German physician <a href="Leonhart%20Fuchs">Leonhart Fuchs</a> (1501–1566) was one of "the three German fathers of botany", along with theologian <a href="Otto%20Brunfels">Otto Brunfels</a> (1489–1534) and physician <a href="Hieronymus%20Bock">Hieronymus Bock</a> (1498–1554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus). Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of plant classification.

Physician <a href="Valerius%20Cordus">Valerius Cordus</a> (1515–1544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal "Historia Plantarum" in 1544 and a <a href="pharmacopoeia">pharmacopoeia</a> of lasting importance, the "Dispensatorium" in 1546. Naturalist <a href="Conrad%20von%20Gesner">Conrad von Gesner</a> (1516–1565) and herbalist <a href="John%20Gerard">John Gerard</a> (1545–c. 1611) published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist <a href="Ulisse%20Aldrovandi">Ulisse Aldrovandi</a> (1522–1605) was considered the "father of natural history", which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, <a href="Polymath">Polymath</a> <a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> discovered <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a>, a term he coined, in <a href="cork%20%28material%29">cork</a>, and a short time later in living plant tissue.

During the 18th century, systems of <a href="plant%20identification">plant identification</a> were developed comparable to <a href="single%20access%20key">dichotomous keys</a>, where unidentified plants are placed into <a href="taxon">taxon</a>omic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of <a href="Character%20%28biology%29">characters</a>. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (<a href="single%20access%20key%23Diagnostic%20%28%27artificial%27%29%20versus%20synoptic%20%28%27natural%27%29%20keys">diagnostic keys</a>) or more closely related to the natural or <a href="taxonomic%20order">phyletic order</a> of the <a href="taxon">taxa</a> in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl von Linné</a> (Carl Linnaeus) published his <a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants">modern botanical nomenclature</a>. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the <a href="genus">genus</a> and the second identified the <a href="species">species</a> within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's "Systema Sexuale" <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy%23Classification%20for%20plants">classified</a> plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, "Cryptogamia", included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.

Increasing knowledge of <a href="plant%20anatomy">plant anatomy</a>, <a href="plant%20morphology">morphology</a> and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. <a href="Michel%20Adanson">Adanson</a> (1763), <a href="Antoine%20Laurent%20de%20Jussieu">de Jussieu</a> (1789), and <a href="Augustin%20Pyramus%20de%20Candolle">Candolle</a> (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The <a href="Candollean%20system">Candollean system</a> reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the <a href="Bentham%20%26amp%3B%20Hooker%20system">later classification</a> by <a href="George%20Bentham">Bentham</a> and <a href="J.D.%20Hooker">Hooker</a>, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a>'s publication of the "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">Origin of Species</a>" in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.

Botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first "modern" textbook, <a href="Matthias%20Jakob%20Schleiden">Matthias Schleiden</a>'s "", published in English in 1849 as "Principles of Scientific Botany". Schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the <a href="cell%20theory">cell theory</a> with <a href="Theodor%20Schwann">Theodor Schwann</a> and <a href="Rudolf%20Virchow">Rudolf Virchow</a> and was among the first to grasp the significance of the <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a> that had been described by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in 1831.
In 1855, <a href="Adolf%20Fick">Adolf Fick</a> formulated <a href="Fick%27s%20laws%20of%20diffusion">Fick's laws</a> that enabled the calculation of the rates of <a href="molecular%20diffusion">molecular diffusion</a> in biological systems.

Building upon the gene-chromosome theory of heredity that originated with <a href="Gregor%20Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a> (1822–1884), <a href="August%20Weismann">August Weismann</a> (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of <a href="Katherine%20Esau">Katherine Esau</a> (1898–1997) on plant anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany. Her books "Plant Anatomy" and "Anatomy of Seed Plants" have been key plant structural biology texts for more than half a century.

The discipline of <a href="plant%20ecology">plant ecology</a> was pioneered in the late 19th century by botanists such as <a href="Eugenius%20Warming">Eugenius Warming</a>, who produced the hypothesis that plants form <a href="plant%20community">communities</a>, and his mentor and successor <a href="Christen%20C.%20Raunki%C3%A6r">Christen C. Raunkiær</a> whose system for describing <a href="Raunki%C3%A6r%20plant%20life-form">plant life forms</a> is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">temperate broadleaf forest</a> changes by a process of <a href="ecological%20succession">ecological succession</a> was developed by <a href="Henry%20Chandler%20Cowles">Henry Chandler Cowles</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Tansley">Arthur Tansley</a> and <a href="Frederic%20Clements">Frederic Clements</a>. Clements is credited with the idea of <a href="climax%20vegetation">climax vegetation</a> as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of <a href="Alphonse%20Pyramus%20de%20Candolle">Alphonse de Candolle</a>, <a href="Nikolai%20Ivanovich%20Vavilov">Nikolai Vavilov</a> (1887–1943) produced accounts of the <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>, <a href="Center%20of%20origin">centres of origin</a>, and evolutionary history of economic plants.

Particularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of the physics of <a href="Plant%20physiology">plant physiological</a> processes such as <a href="transpiration">transpiration</a> (the transport of water within plant tissues), the temperature dependence of rates of water <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a> from the leaf surface and the <a href="molecular%20diffusion">molecular diffusion</a> of water vapour and carbon dioxide through <a href="stomatal">stomatal</a> apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, and the rate of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> have enabled precise description of the rates of <a href="gas%20exchange">gas exchange</a> between plants and the atmosphere. Innovations in <a href="Statistics">statistical analysis</a> by <a href="Ronald%20Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>, <a href="Frank%20Yates">Frank Yates</a> and others at <a href="Rothamsted%20Research%23Statistical%20science">Rothamsted Experimental Station</a> facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research. The discovery and identification of the <a href="auxin">auxin</a> <a href="Plant%20physiology%23Plant%20hormones">plant hormones</a> by <a href="Kenneth%20V.%20Thimann">Kenneth V. Thimann</a> in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals. <a href="Frederick%20Campion%20Steward">Frederick Campion Steward</a> pioneered techniques of <a href="micropropagation">micropropagation</a> and <a href="plant%20tissue%20culture">plant tissue culture</a> controlled by plant hormones. The synthetic auxin <a href="2%2C4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic%20acid">2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid</a> or 2,4-D was one of the first commercial synthetic herbicides.

20th century developments in plant biochemistry have been driven by modern techniques of <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemical analysis</a>, such as <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a>, <a href="chromatography">chromatography</a> and <a href="electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a>. With the rise of the related molecular-scale biological approaches of <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>, <a href="genomics">genomics</a>, <a href="proteomics">proteomics</a> and <a href="metabolomics">metabolomics</a>, the relationship between the plant <a href="genome">genome</a> and most aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis. The concept originally stated by <a href="Gottlieb%20Haberlandt">Gottlieb Haberlandt</a> in 1902 that all plant cells are <a href="Cell%20potency%23Totipotency">totipotent</a> and can be grown "in vitro" ultimately enabled the use of <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as <a href="Green%20fluorescent%20protein">GFP</a> that <a href="reporter%20gene">report</a> when a gene of interest is being expressed. These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in <a href="bioreactors">bioreactors</a> to synthesise <a href="Bt%20corn">pesticides</a>, <a href="Biopharmaceutics">antibiotics</a> or other <a href="pharming%20%28genetics%29">pharmaceuticals</a>, as well as the practical application of <a href="genetically%20modified%20crops">genetically modified crops</a> designed for traits such as improved yield.

Modern morphology recognises a continuum between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics aims to reflect and discover <a href="Phylogenetic%20nomenclature">phylogenetic relationships</a> between plants. Modern <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular phylogenetics</a> largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of <a href="nucleic%20acid%20sequence">DNA sequences</a> from most families of flowering plants enabled the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Group">Angiosperm Phylogeny Group</a> to publish in 1998 a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> of flowering plants, answering many of the questions about relationships among <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a> families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by <a href="DNA%20barcoding">DNA barcoding</a> is the subject of active current research.

The study of plants is vital because they underpin almost all animal life on Earth by generating a large proportion of the <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and food that provide humans and other organisms with <a href="cellular%20respiration">aerobic respiration</a> with the chemical energy they need to exist. Plants, <a href="algae">algae</a> and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> are the major groups of organisms that carry out <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by <a href="anaerobic%20organism">nearly</a> all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon</a> and <a href="water%20cycle">water</a> cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil <a href="erosion">erosion</a>. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.

Historically, all living things were classified as either animals or plants and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals. Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant communities. At each of these levels, a botanist may be concerned with the classification (<a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a>), <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> and <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, structure (<a href="Plant%20anatomy">anatomy</a> and <a href="Plant%20morphology">morphology</a>), or function (<a href="Plant%20physiology">physiology</a>) of plant life.

The strictest definition of "plant" includes only the "land plants" or <a href="embryophytes">embryophytes</a>, which include <a href="seed%20plants">seed plants</a> (gymnosperms, including the <a href="Pinophyta">pines</a>, and <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s) and the free-sporing <a href="cryptogams">cryptogams</a> including <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="Lycopodiopsida">clubmosses</a>, <a href="Marchantiophyta">liverworts</a>, <a href="hornwort">hornwort</a>s and <a href="moss">moss</a>es. Embryophytes are multicellular <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. They have life cycles with <a href="alternation%20of%20generations">alternating</a> <a href="haploid">haploid</a> and <a href="diploid">diploid</a> phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, known as the <a href="gametophyte">gametophyte</a>, nurtures the developing diploid embryo <a href="sporophyte">sporophyte</a> within its tissues for at least part of its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in <a href="bacteriology">bacteriology</a>), fungi (<a href="mycology">mycology</a>) – including <a href="lichen">lichen</a>-forming fungi (<a href="lichenology">lichenology</a>), non-<a href="Chlorophyta">chlorophyte</a> <a href="algae">algae</a> (<a href="phycology">phycology</a>), and viruses (<a href="virology">virology</a>). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic <a href="protist">protist</a>s are usually covered in introductory botany courses.

<a href="Paleobotany">Palaeobotanists</a> study ancient plants in the fossil record to provide information about the <a href="evolutionary%20history%20of%20plants">evolutionary history of plants</a>. <a href="Cyanobacteria">Cyanobacteria</a>, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an <a href="endosymbiotic">endosymbiotic</a> relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> started by the <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, <a href="great%20oxygenation%20event">changing</a> the ancient oxygen-free, <a href="Redox">reducing</a>, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.

Among the important botanical questions of the 21st century are the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and water, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of <a href="resource%20management">resource management</a>, <a href="Conservation%20%28ethic%29">conservation</a>, <a href="food%20security">human food security</a>, <a href="introduced%20species">biologically invasive organisms</a>, <a href="carbon%20sequestration">carbon sequestration</a>, <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, and <a href="sustainability">sustainability</a>.

Virtually all staple foods come either directly from <a href="primary%20production">primary production</a> by plants, or indirectly from animals that eat them. Plants and other photosynthetic organisms are at the base of most <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>s because they use the energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere, converting them into a form that can be used by animals. This is what ecologists call the first <a href="trophic%20level">trophic level</a>. The modern forms of the major <a href="staple%20food">staple food</a>s, such as maize, rice, wheat and other cereal grasses, <a href="Pulse%20%28legume%29">pulses</a>, bananas and plantains, as well as <a href="flax">flax</a> and cotton grown for their fibres, are the outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among <a href="Neolithic%20founder%20crops">wild ancestral plants</a> with the most desirable characteristics.

Botanists study how plants produce food and how to increase yields, for example through <a href="plant%20breeding">plant breeding</a>, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide <a href="food%20security">food security</a> for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of <a href="Plant%20pathology">plant pathogens</a> in agriculture and natural <a href="ecosystems">ecosystems</a>. <a href="Ethnobotany">Ethnobotany</a> is the study of the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or <a href="paleoethnobotany">palaeoethnobotany</a>. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous people</a> of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.

Plant biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes used by plants. Some of these processes are used in their <a href="primary%20metabolism">primary metabolism</a> like the photosynthetic <a href="Calvin%20cycle">Calvin cycle</a> and <a href="crassulacean%20acid%20metabolism">crassulacean acid metabolism</a>. Others make specialised materials like the <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> and <a href="lignin">lignin</a> used to build their bodies, and <a href="Secondary%20metabolism">secondary products</a> like <a href="resin">resin</a>s and <a href="aroma%20compounds">aroma compounds</a>.

Plants and various other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes collectively known as "<a href="algae">algae</a>" have unique organelles known as <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s. Chloroplasts are thought to be descended from <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> that formed <a href="endosymbiotic">endosymbiotic</a> relationships with ancient plant and algal ancestors. Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain the blue-green pigment <a href="chlorophyll%20a">chlorophyll "a"</a>. Chlorophyll "a" (as well as its plant and green algal-specific cousin <a href="chlorophyll%20b">chlorophyll "b"</a>) absorbs light in the blue-violet and orange/red parts of the <a href="visible%20spectrum">spectrum</a> while reflecting and transmitting the green light that we see as the characteristic colour of these organisms. The energy in the red and blue light that these pigments absorb is used by chloroplasts to make energy-rich carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by <a href="Carbon%20fixation%23Oxygenic%20photosynthesis">oxygenic photosynthesis</a>, a process that generates <a href="molecular%20oxygen">molecular oxygen</a> (O) as a by-product.

The light energy captured by <a href="chlorophyll%20a">chlorophyll "a"</a> is initially in the form of electrons (and later a <a href="proton%20gradient">proton gradient</a>) that's used to make molecules of <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> and <a href="NADPH">NADPH</a> which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the <a href="light-independent%20reactions">light-independent reactions</a> of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme <a href="rubisco">rubisco</a> to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar <a href="glyceraldehyde%203-phosphate">glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate</a> (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which <a href="glucose">glucose</a> and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while <a href="inulin">inulin</a>, a polymer of <a href="fructose">fructose</a> is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a>. Some of the glucose is converted to <a href="sucrose">sucrose</a> (common table sugar) for export to the rest of the plant.

Unlike in animals (which lack chloroplasts), plants and their eukaryote relatives have delegated many biochemical roles to their <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s, including synthesising all their <a href="fatty%20acids">fatty acids</a>, and most <a href="amino%20acids">amino acids</a>. The fatty acids that chloroplasts make are used for many things, such as providing material to build <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s out of and making the polymer <a href="cutin">cutin</a> which is found in the <a href="plant%20cuticle">plant cuticle</a> that protects land plants from drying out. 

Plants synthesise a number of unique <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s like the <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a> molecules <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, <a href="pectin">pectin</a> and <a href="xyloglucan">xyloglucan</a> from which the land plant cell wall is constructed.
Vascular land plants make <a href="lignin">lignin</a>, a polymer used to strengthen the <a href="secondary%20cell%20walls">secondary cell walls</a> of xylem <a href="tracheid">tracheid</a>s and <a href="Xylem%20vessel%20element">vessels</a> to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like <a href="Ground%20tissue%23Sclerenchyma">sclerenchyma fibres</a> that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. <a href="Sporopollenin">Sporopollenin</a> is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> period.
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> and <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a> periods. Many <a href="monocots">monocots</a> like <a href="maize">maize</a> and the <a href="pineapple">pineapple</a> and some <a href="dicots">dicots</a> like the <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a> have since independently evolved pathways like <a href="Crassulacean%20acid%20metabolism">Crassulacean acid metabolism</a> and the <a href="C4%20carbon%20fixation">carbon fixation</a> pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from <a href="photorespiration">photorespiration</a> in the more common <a href="C3%20carbon%20fixation">carbon fixation</a> pathway. These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants.

<a href="Phytochemistry">Phytochemistry</a> is a branch of plant biochemistry primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during <a href="secondary%20metabolism">secondary metabolism</a>. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a> <a href="coniine">coniine</a> from <a href="conium">hemlock</a>. Others, such as the <a href="essential%20oil">essential oil</a>s <a href="Peppermint%23Peppermint%20oil">peppermint oil</a> and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., <a href="capsaicin">capsaicin</a>), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in <a href="opium">opium</a> from <a href="Papaver%20somniferum">opium poppies</a>. Many <a href="medication">medicinal</a> and <a href="recreational%20drugs">recreational drugs</a>, such as <a href="tetrahydrocannabinol">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> (active ingredient in <a href="Cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>), <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a>, <a href="morphine">morphine</a> and <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a> come directly from plants. Others are simple <a href="Derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a> is the acetyl <a href="ester">ester</a> of <a href="salicylic%20acid">salicylic acid</a>, originally isolated from the <a href="bark">bark</a> of <a href="willow">willow</a> trees, and a wide range of <a href="opiate">opiate</a> <a href="analgesics">painkillers</a> like <a href="diamorphine">heroin</a> are obtained by chemical modification of <a href="morphine">morphine</a> obtained from the <a href="opium%20poppy">opium poppy</a>. Popular <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s come from plants, such as <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a> from coffee, tea and chocolate, and <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a> from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermentation</a> of <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>-rich plant products such as <a href="barley">barley</a> (beer), rice (<a href="sake">sake</a>) and grapes (wine). <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by <a href="Ethnobotany">enthnobotanists</a> and then in turn has been used by <a href="Pharmaceutical%20industry">pharmaceutical companies</a> as a way of <a href="drug%20discovery">drug discovery</a>.

Plants can synthesise useful coloured dyes and pigments such as the <a href="anthocyanin">anthocyanin</a>s responsible for the red colour of <a href="red%20wine">red wine</a>, yellow <a href="Reseda%20luteola">weld</a> and blue <a href="Isatis%20tinctoria">woad</a> used together to produce <a href="Lincoln%20green">Lincoln green</a>, <a href="indoxyl">indoxyl</a>, source of the blue dye <a href="indigo">indigo</a> traditionally used to dye denim and the artist's pigments <a href="gamboge">gamboge</a> and <a href="rose%20madder">rose madder</a>.
Sugar, <a href="starch">starch</a>, cotton, <a href="linen">linen</a>, <a href="hemp">hemp</a>, some types of <a href="rope">rope</a>, wood and <a href="particle%20board">particle board</a>s, <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a> and paper, <a href="vegetable%20oil">vegetable oil</a>s, <a href="epicuticular%20wax">wax</a>, and <a href="natural%20rubber">natural rubber</a> are examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their secondary products. <a href="Charcoal">Charcoal</a>, a pure form of carbon made by <a href="pyrolysis">pyrolysis</a> of wood, has a long <a href="charcoal%23History">history</a> as a metal-<a href="smelting">smelting</a> fuel, as a filter material and <a href="activated%20carbon%23Applications">adsorbent</a> and as an artist's material and is one of the three ingredients of <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a>. <a href="Cellulose">Cellulose</a>, the world's most abundant organic polymer, can be converted into energy, fuels, materials and chemical feedstock. <a href="cellulose%23products">Products made from cellulose</a> include <a href="rayon">rayon</a> and <a href="cellophane">cellophane</a>, <a href="methyl%20cellulose">wallpaper paste</a>, <a href="Butanol%20fuel%23Using%20Alternate%20Carbon%20Sources">biobutanol</a> and <a href="nitrocellulose">gun cotton</a>. <a href="Sugarcane">Sugarcane</a>, <a href="rapeseed">rapeseed</a> and <a href="soy">soy</a> are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content that are used as sources of <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>s, important alternatives to <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a>s, such as <a href="biodiesel">biodiesel</a>. Sweetgrass was used by NativeAmericanse to ward of bugs like <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es. These bug repelling properties of sweetgrass were later found by the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a> in the molecules <a href="phytol">phytol</a> and <a href="coumarin">coumarin</a>.

Plant ecology is the science of the functional relationships between plants and their <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s—the environments where they complete their <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life cycles</a>. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional <a href="flora">flora</a>s, their <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, genetic diversity and <a href="Fitness%20%28biology%29">fitness</a>, the <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a> of plants to their environment, and their competitive or <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on <a href="Empirical%20evidence">empirical data</a> from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists. This information can relay a great deal of information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it has changed over that time. The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.

Plants depend on certain <a href="edaphic">edaphic</a> (soil) and climatic factors in their environment but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's <a href="albedo">albedo</a>, increase <a href="Surface%20runoff">runoff</a> interception, stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> for resources. They interact with their neighbours at a variety of <a href="spatial%20scale">spatial scale</a>s in groups, populations and <a href="Community%20%28ecology%29">communities</a> that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic <a href="Holdridge%20life%20zones">vegetation types</a> and dominant plants as well as similar <a href="Abiotic%20component">abiotic</a> and <a href="Biotic%20components">biotic</a> factors, <a href="climate">climate</a>, and <a href="geography">geography</a> make up <a href="biomes">biomes</a> like <a href="tundra">tundra</a> or <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>.
<a href="Herbivore">Herbivore</a>s eat plants, but plants can <a href="plant%20defence%20against%20herbivory">defend themselves</a> and some species are <a href="parasitic%20plant">parasitic</a> or even <a href="carnivorous%20plant">carnivorous</a>. Other organisms form <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutually</a> beneficial relationships with plants. For example, <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l fungi and <a href="rhizobia">rhizobia</a> provide plants with nutrients in exchange for food, <a href="ant">ant</a>s are recruited by <a href="myrmecophyte">ant plants</a> to provide protection, <a href="honey%20bee">honey bee</a>s, <a href="bat">bat</a>s and other animals <a href="pollinate">pollinate</a> flowers and <a href="seed%20dispersal%23Dispersal%20by%20humans">humans</a> and <a href="seed%20dispersal%23Dispersal%20by%20animals">other animals</a> act as <a href="dispersal%20vector">dispersal vector</a>s to spread <a href="spore">spore</a>s and <a href="seed">seed</a>s.

Plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant <a href="phenology">phenology</a> can be a useful <a href="proxy%20%28climate%29">proxy</a> for temperature in <a href="historical%20climatology">historical climatology</a>, and the biological impact of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> and <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>. <a href="Palynology">Palynology</a>, the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from <a href="geologic%20timescale">thousands or millions of years ago</a> allows the reconstruction of past climates. Estimates of atmospheric concentrations since the <a href="Palaeozoic">Palaeozoic</a> have been obtained from <a href="stomatal">stomatal</a> densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient <a href="land%20plants">land plants</a>. <a href="Ozone%20depletion">Ozone depletion</a> can expose plants to higher levels of <a href="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet radiation-B</a> (UV-B), resulting in lower growth rates. Moreover, information from studies of <a href="community%20%28ecology%29">community ecology</a>, plant <a href="systematics">systematics</a>, and <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> is essential to understanding <a href="climate%20change%23Vegetation">vegetation change</a>, <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and <a href="endangered%20species">species extinction</a>.

Inheritance in plants follows the same fundamental principles of genetics as in other multicellular organisms. <a href="Gregor%20Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a> discovered the <a href="Mendelian%20inheritance">genetic laws of inheritance</a> by studying inherited traits such as shape in "Pisum sativum" (<a href="peas">peas</a>). What Mendel learned from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside of botany. Similarly, "<a href="transposon">jumping genes</a>" were discovered by <a href="Barbara%20McClintock">Barbara McClintock</a> while she was studying maize. Nevertheless, there are some distinctive genetic differences between plants and other organisms.

Species boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> are often possible. A familiar example is <a href="peppermint">peppermint</a>, "Mentha" × "piperita", a <a href="Sterility%20%28physiology%29">sterile</a> hybrid between "<a href="Mentha%20aquatica">Mentha aquatica</a>" and spearmint, "<a href="Mentha%20spicata">Mentha spicata</a>". The many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple inter- and intra-<a href="species">specific</a> crosses between wild species and their hybrids. <a href="Angiosperms">Angiosperms</a> with <a href="monoecious">monoecious</a> flowers often have <a href="Self-incompatibility%20in%20plants">self-incompatibility mechanisms</a> that operate between the <a href="pollen">pollen</a> and <a href="stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a> so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to <a href="germinate">germinate</a> and produce male <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote <a href="plant%20reproductive%20morphology">outcrossing</a>. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be <a href="Plant%20reproductive%20morphology%23Terminology">dioecious</a> when referring to vascular plant <a href="sporophyte">sporophyte</a>s and <a href="monoecious">dioicous</a> when referring to <a href="bryophyte">bryophyte</a> <a href="gametophyte">gametophyte</a>s.

Unlike in higher animals, where <a href="parthenogenesis">parthenogenesis</a> is rare, <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual reproduction</a> may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem <a href="tuber">tuber</a>s in potato is one example. Particularly in <a href="arctic">arctic</a> or <a href="alpine%20climate">alpine</a> habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers <a href="zoophily">by animals</a> are rare, plantlets or <a href="bulbs">bulbs</a>, may develop instead of flowers, replacing <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a> with <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual reproduction</a> and giving rise to <a href="cloning">clonal populations</a> genetically identical to the parent. This is one of several types of <a href="apomixis">apomixis</a> that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a <a href="seed">seed</a>, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.

Most <a href="sexually%20reproducing">sexually reproducing</a> organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their <a href="chromosome%20number">chromosome number</a> may occur due to errors in <a href="cell%20division">cytokinesis</a>. This can occur early in development to produce an <a href="autopolyploid">autopolyploid</a> or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (<a href="endopolyploidy">endopolyploidy</a>), or during <a href="gamete">gamete</a> formation. An <a href="allopolyploid">allopolyploid</a> plant may result from a <a href="hybridization%20event">hybridisation event</a> between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are <a href="reproductively%20isolated">reproductively isolated</a> from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new <a href="sympatric%20speciation">species</a>. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce <a href="vegetative%20propagation">vegetatively</a> or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. <a href="Durum">Durum</a> wheat is a fertile <a href="tetraploid">tetraploid</a> allopolyploid, while <a href="common%20wheat">bread wheat</a> is a fertile <a href="hexaploid">hexaploid</a>. The commercial banana is an example of a sterile, seedless <a href="triploid">triploid</a> hybrid. <a href="Taraxacum%20officinale">Common dandelion</a> is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.

As in other eukaryotes, the inheritance of <a href="endosymbiotic">endosymbiotic</a> organelles like <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> and <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s in plants is non-<a href="Mendelian">Mendelian</a>. Chloroplasts are inherited through the male parent in gymnosperms but often through the female parent in flowering plants.

A considerable amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of <a href="model%20organism%23Plants">model plants</a> such as the Thale cress, "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>", a weedy species in the mustard family (<a href="Brassicaceae">Brassicaceae</a>). The <a href="genome">genome</a> or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million <a href="base%20pairs">base pairs</a> of DNA, forming one of the smallest genomes among <a href="flowering%20plants">flowering plants</a>. "Arabidopsis" was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice ("<a href="Oryza%20sativa">Oryza sativa</a>") and "<a href="Brachypodium%20distachyon">Brachypodium distachyon</a>", has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of <a href="cereals">cereals</a>, <a href="grasses">grasses</a> and <a href="monocots">monocots</a> generally.

<a href="Model%20organism%23Plants">Model plants</a> such as "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" are used for studying the molecular biology of <a href="plant%20cell">plant cell</a>s and the <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>. Ideally, these organisms have small genomes that are well known or completely sequenced, small stature and short generation times. Corn has been used to study mechanisms of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> and <a href="phloem">phloem</a> loading of sugar in <a href="C4%20plants">plants</a>. The <a href="single%20celled">single celled</a> <a href="green%20alga">green alga</a> "<a href="Chlamydomonas%20reinhardtii">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</a>", while not an <a href="embryophyte">embryophyte</a> itself, contains a <a href="chlorophyll%20b">green-pigmented</a> <a href="Chloroplast%23Chloroplastida%20%28green%20algae%20and%20plants%29">chloroplast</a> related to that of land plants, making it useful for study. A <a href="red%20alga">red alga</a> "<a href="Cyanidioschyzon%20merolae">Cyanidioschyzon merolae</a>" has also been used to study some basic chloroplast functions. <a href="Spinach">Spinach</a>, <a href="peas">peas</a>, <a href="soybeans">soybeans</a> and a moss "<a href="Physcomitrella%20patens">Physcomitrella patens</a>" are commonly used to study plant cell biology.

"<a href="Agrobacterium%20tumefaciens">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</a>", a soil <a href="rhizosphere">rhizosphere</a> bacterium, can attach to plant cells and infect them with a <a href="Callus%20%28cell%20biology%29">callus</a>-inducing <a href="Ti%20plasmid">Ti plasmid</a> by <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a>, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the <a href="Nif%20gene">Nif gene</a> responsible for <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">nitrogen fixation</a> in the root nodules of <a href="Fabaceae">legumes</a> and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid is one of the main techniques for introduction of <a href="transgene">transgene</a>s to plants and the creation of <a href="genetically%20modified%20crops">genetically modified crops</a>.

<a href="Epigenetics">Epigenetics</a> is the study of heritable changes in <a href="gene%20expression">gene function</a> that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> but cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently. One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by <a href="DNA%20methylation">DNA methylation</a> which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to <a href="silencer%20%28DNA%29">silencer</a> regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a>s for the remainder of the cell's life. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be <a href="Heritability">heritable</a>, while others are reset in the germ cells.

Epigenetic changes in <a href="Eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> biology serve to regulate the process of <a href="cellular%20differentiation">cellular differentiation</a>. During <a href="morphogenesis">morphogenesis</a>, <a href="totipotent">totipotent</a> <a href="stem%20cells">stem cells</a> become the various <a href="pluripotent">pluripotent</a> <a href="cell%20line">cell line</a>s of the <a href="embryo">embryo</a>, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the <a href="zygote">zygote</a>, gives rise to the many different <a href="plant%20cell">plant cell</a> types including <a href="parenchyma">parenchyma</a>, <a href="vessel%20element">xylem vessel elements</a>, <a href="phloem">phloem</a> sieve tubes, <a href="guard%20cell">guard cell</a>s of the <a href="epidermis%20%28botany%29">epidermis</a>, etc. as it continues to <a href="mitosis">divide</a>. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.

Unlike animals, many plant cells, particularly those of the <a href="ground%20tissue%23Parenchyma">parenchyma</a>, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the <a href="ground%20tissue%23Sclerenchyma">sclerenchyma</a> and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as <a href="chromatin%20remodeling">chromatin remodelling</a>, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.

The <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s of plants have a number of biochemical, structural and genetic similarities to <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, (commonly but incorrectly known as "blue-green algae") and are thought to be derived from an ancient <a href="endosymbiotic%20theory">endosymbiotic</a> relationship between an ancestral <a href="eukaryote">eukaryotic cell</a> and a <a href="Chloroplast%23Cyanobacterial%20ancestor">cyanobacterial resident</a>.

The <a href="algae">algae</a> are a <a href="Polyphyly">polyphyletic</a> group and are placed in various divisions, some more closely related to plants than others. There are many differences between them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation, chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves. The algal division <a href="Charophyta">Charophyta</a>, sister to the green algal division <a href="Chlorophyta">Chlorophyta</a>, is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants. The Charophyte class <a href="Charophyceae">Charophyceae</a> and the land plant sub-kingdom <a href="Embryophyta">Embryophyta</a> together form the <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> group or clade <a href="Streptophytina">Streptophytina</a>.

Nonvascular land plants are <a href="embryophyte">embryophyte</a>s that lack the vascular tissues <a href="xylem">xylem</a> and <a href="phloem">phloem</a>. They include <a href="moss">moss</a>es, <a href="Marchantiophyta">liverworts</a> and <a href="hornwort">hornwort</a>s. <a href="Pteridophyte">Pteridophytic</a> vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the Silurian period and diversified into several lineages during the late <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a> and early <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a>. Representatives of the lycopods have survived to the present day. By the end of the Devonian period, several groups, including the <a href="Lycopodiophyta">lycopods</a>, <a href="Sphenophyllales">sphenophylls</a> and <a href="progymnosperm">progymnosperm</a>s, had independently evolved "megaspory" – their spores were of two distinct sizes, larger <a href="megaspore">megaspore</a>s and smaller microspores. Their reduced gametophytes developed from megaspores retained within the <a href="sporangium">spore-producing organs</a> (megasporangia) of the sporophyte, a condition known as endospory. Seeds consist of an endosporic megasporangium surrounded by one or two sheathing layers (<a href="integument">integument</a>s). The young sporophyte develops within the seed, which on <a href="germination">germination</a> splits to release it. The earliest known seed plants date from the latest Devonian <a href="Famennian">Famennian</a> stage. Following the evolution of the seed habit, <a href="Spermatophyte">seed plants</a> diversified, giving rise to a number of now-extinct groups, including <a href="Pteridospermatophyta">seed ferns</a>, as well as the modern <a href="gymnosperm">gymnosperm</a>s and <a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a>. <a href="Gymnosperm">Gymnosperm</a>s produce "naked seeds" not fully enclosed in an ovary; modern representatives include <a href="Pinophyta">conifers</a>, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, "<a href="Ginkgo">Ginkgo</a>", and <a href="Gnetophyta">Gnetales</a>. Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure such as a <a href="Gynoecium">carpel</a> or an <a href="ovary">ovary</a>. Ongoing research on the molecular phylogenetics of living plants appears to show that the angiosperms are a <a href="sister%20clade">sister clade</a> to the gymnosperms.

Plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals obtained from the air, soil and water form the basis of all <a href="metabolism">plant metabolism</a>. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by <a href="cellular%20respiration">cellular respiration</a>, is the basis of almost all life. <a href="Phototroph">Photoautotrophs</a>, including all green plants, algae and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. <a href="Heterotroph">Heterotroph</a>s including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. <a href="Cellular%20respiration">Respiration</a> is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.

Molecules are moved within plants by transport processes that operate at a variety of <a href="spatial%20scale">spatial scale</a>s. Subcellular transport of ions, electrons and molecules such as water and <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s occurs across <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s. Minerals and water are transported from roots to other parts of the plant in the <a href="transpiration%20stream">transpiration stream</a>. <a href="Diffusion">Diffusion</a>, <a href="osmosis">osmosis</a>, and <a href="active%20transport">active transport</a> and <a href="mass%20flow">mass flow</a> are all different ways transport can occur. Examples of <a href="plant%20nutrition">elements that plants need</a> to transport are <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>. In vascular plants, these elements are extracted from the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the plant in the xylem. Most of the elements required for <a href="plant%20nutrition">plant nutrition</a> come from the chemical breakdown of soil minerals. <a href="Sucrose">Sucrose</a> produced by photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and <a href="Plant%20physiology%23Plant%20hormones">plant hormones</a> are transported by a variety of processes.

Plants are not passive, but respond to <a href="signal%20transduction">external signals</a> such as light, touch, and injury by moving or growing towards or away from the stimulus, as appropriate. Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous collapse of leaflets of "<a href="Mimosa%20pudica">Mimosa pudica</a>", the insect traps of <a href="Venus%20flytrap">Venus flytrap</a> and <a href="bladderwort">bladderwort</a>s, and the pollinia of orchids.

The hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by <a href="plant%20hormone">plant hormone</a>s or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards <a href="heliotropism">light</a> and <a href="geotropism">gravity</a>, and concluded "It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . . directing the several movements". About the same time, the role of <a href="auxin">auxin</a>s (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist <a href="Frits%20Went">Frits Went</a>. The first known auxin, <a href="indole-3-acetic%20acid">indole-3-acetic acid</a> (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant <a href="callus%20%28cell%20biology%29">callus</a> could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.

Another class of <a href="phytohormone">phytohormone</a>s is the <a href="jasmonate">jasmonate</a>s, first isolated from the oil of "<a href="Jasminum%20grandiflorum">Jasminum grandiflorum</a>" which regulates wound responses in plants by unblocking the expression of genes required in the <a href="systemic%20acquired%20resistance">systemic acquired resistance</a> response to pathogen attack.

In addition to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in a process known as <a href="photomorphogenesis">photomorphogenesis</a>. <a href="Phytochrome">Phytochrome</a>s are the <a href="Photoreceptor%20protein">photoreceptors</a> in a plant that are sensitive to light.

<a href="Plant%20anatomy">Plant anatomy</a> is the study of the structure of plant cells and tissues, whereas <a href="plant%20morphology">plant morphology</a> is the study of their external form.
All plants are multicellular eukaryotes, their DNA stored in nuclei. The characteristic features of <a href="plant%20cell">plant cell</a>s that distinguish them from those of animals and fungi include a primary <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> composed of the polysaccharides <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, <a href="hemicellulose">hemicellulose</a> and <a href="pectin">pectin</a>, larger <a href="vacuole">vacuole</a>s than in animal cells and the presence of <a href="plastid">plastid</a>s with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic functions as in the chloroplasts. Other plastids contain storage products such as starch (<a href="amyloplasts">amyloplasts</a>) or lipids (<a href="elaioplast">elaioplast</a>s). Uniquely, <a href="streptophyte">streptophyte</a> cells and those of the green algal order <a href="Trentepohliales">Trentepohliales</a> divide by construction of a <a href="phragmoplast">phragmoplast</a> as a template for building a <a href="cell%20plate">cell plate</a> late in <a href="cytokinesis">cell division</a>.

The bodies of <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a>s including <a href="Lycopodiopsida">clubmosses</a>, <a href="fern">fern</a>s and <a href="spermatophyte">seed plants</a> (<a href="gymnosperm">gymnosperm</a>s and <a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a>) generally have aerial and subterranean subsystems. The <a href="shoot">shoot</a>s consist of <a href="Plant%20stem">stems</a> bearing green photosynthesising <a href="Leaf">leaves</a> and reproductive structures. The underground vascularised <a href="root">root</a>s bear <a href="root%20hairs">root hairs</a> at their tips and generally lack chlorophyll. Non-vascular plants, the <a href="Marchantiophyta">liverworts</a>, <a href="hornworts">hornworts</a> and <a href="mosses">mosses</a> do not produce ground-penetrating vascular roots and most of the plant participates in photosynthesis. The <a href="sporophyte">sporophyte</a> generation is nonphotosynthetic in liverworts but may be able to contribute part of its energy needs by photosynthesis in mosses and hornworts.

The root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system. Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing <a href="adventitious">adventitious</a> shoots or roots. <a href="Stolons">Stolons</a> and <a href="tuber">tuber</a>s are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, as is the case with "<a href="Saintpaulia">Saintpaulia</a>", or even a single <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a> – which can dedifferentiate into a <a href="Callus%20%28cell%20biology%29">callus</a> (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.
In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or <a href="starch">starch</a>, as in <a href="sugar%20beet">sugar beet</a>s and carrots.

Stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as <a href="Cactus">cacti</a>, food as in potato <a href="tubers">tubers</a>, or <a href="vegetative%20reproduction">reproduce vegetatively</a> as in the <a href="stolons">stolons</a> of <a href="strawberry%23Cultivation">strawberry</a> plants or in the process of <a href="layering">layering</a>. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. <a href="Gymnosperm">Gymnosperm</a>s, such as <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, "<a href="Ginkgo">Ginkgo</a>", and <a href="gnetophyta">gnetophytes</a> are seed-producing plants with open seeds. <a href="Angiosperms">Angiosperms</a> are <a href="Spermatophyte">seed-producing plants</a> that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as <a href="azalea">azalea</a>s and <a href="oak">oak</a>s, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary <a href="xylem">xylem</a>) and bark (secondary <a href="phloem">phloem</a> and <a href="Cork%20cambium">cork</a>). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.

Although reference to major morphological categories such as root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has to keep in mind that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results. Furthermore, structures can be seen as processes, that is, process combinations.

Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetics</a>. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as <a href="genus">genera</a> or <a href="species">species</a>. Biological classification is a form of <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">scientific taxonomy</a>. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwinian</a> principle of <a href="common%20descent">common descent</a> – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than <a href="phenotype">superficial characteristics</a>. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a>, which uses <a href="DNA%20sequences">DNA sequences</a> as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">Linnaean taxonomy</a>. It includes ranks and <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a>. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Nomenclature%20for%20algae%2C%20fungi%2C%20and%20plants">International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants</a> (ICN) and administered by the <a href="International%20Botanical%20Congress">International Botanical Congress</a>.

<a href="Kingdom%20%28biology%29">Kingdom</a> <a href="Plant">Plant</a>ae belongs to <a href="Domain%20%28biology%29">Domain</a> <a href="Eukarya">Eukarya</a> and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: <a href="Kingdom%20%28biology%29">Kingdom</a>; <a href="Phylum">Phylum</a> (or Division); <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">Class</a>; <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">Order</a>; <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">Family</a>; <a href="Genus">Genus</a> (plural "genera"); <a href="Species">Species</a>. The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is "<a href="Lilium%20columbianum">Lilium columbianum</a>". "Lilium" is the genus, and "columbianum" the <a href="Botanical%20name%23Binary%20name">specific epithet</a>. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).

The evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a>. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships. As an example, species of "<a href="Pereskia">Pereskia</a>" are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless <a href="cactus">cactus</a> such as an "<a href="Echinocactus">Echinocactus</a>". However, both "Pereskia" and "Echinocactus" have spines produced from <a href="areoles">areoles</a> (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.
Judging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a> in which characters have arisen independently. Some <a href="euphorbia">euphorbia</a>s have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The <a href="Cladistics">cladistic method</a> takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (<a href="homoplasies">homoplasies</a>) or those left over from ancestors (<a href="plesiomorphies">plesiomorphies</a>) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (<a href="apomorphies">apomorphies</a>). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a>s: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.

From the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a>, which uses molecular characters, particularly <a href="DNA">DNA</a> sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. <a href="Clive%20A.%20Stace">Clive Stace</a> describes this as having "direct access to the genetic basis of evolution." As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below – fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.

In 1998 the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Group">Angiosperm Phylogeny Group</a> published a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of <a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a>, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various <a href="Taxon">taxa</a>. Technological developments such as computers and <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a>s have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.

Bacillus thuringiensis

Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) is a <a href="Gram-positive">Gram-positive</a>, soil-dwelling <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a>, commonly used as a <a href="biological%20pesticide">biological pesticide</a>. "B. thuringiensis" also occurs naturally in the gut of <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s of various types of <a href="moth">moth</a>s and <a href="butterfly">butterflies</a>, as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, and flour mills and grain-storage facilities.

During <a href="sporulation">sporulation</a>, many Bt strains produce <a href="crystal%20protein">crystal protein</a>s (proteinaceous inclusions), called <a href="%CE%B4-endotoxins">δ-endotoxins</a>, that have <a href="Insecticide">insecticidal</a> action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to <a href="genetically%20modified%20crops">genetically modified crops</a> using Bt genes, such as <a href="Genetically%20modified%20maize%23Bt%20corn">Bt corn</a>. Many crystal-producing Bt <a href="strain%20%28biology%29">strains</a>, though, do not have insecticidal properties.

"B. thuringiensis" was first discovered in 1901 by Japanese <a href="biologist">biologist</a> in <a href="silkworm">silkworm</a>s. He named it "Bacillus sotto", using the Japanese word , here referring to bacillary paralysis.
In 1911, German microbiologist <a href="Ernst%20Berliner">Ernst Berliner</a> independently rediscovered it when he isolated it as the cause of a disease called "" in <a href="Ephestia%20kuehniella">flour moth</a> caterpillars in <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a> (hence the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "thuringiensis", "Thuringian"). 
"B. sotto" would later be reassigned as "B. thuringiensis" var. "sotto".

In 1976, Robert A. Zakharyan reported the presence of a plasmid in a strain of "B. thuringiensis" and suggested the plasmid's involvement in endospore and crystal formation. "B. thuringiensis" is closely related to "<a href="Bacillus%20cereus">B. cereus</a>", a soil bacterium, and "<a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">B. anthracis</a>", the cause of <a href="Anthrax%20disease">anthrax</a>; the three organisms differ mainly in their <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a>s. Like other members of the genus, all three are <a href="aerobe">aerobe</a>s capable of producing <a href="endospore">endospore</a>s.

There are several dozen recognized subspecies of bacillus thuringiensis. Subspecies commonly used as insecticides include <a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis%20kurstaki">"Bacillus thuringiensis" subspecies "kurstaki"</a> (Btk) and <a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis%20israelensis">subspecies "israelensis"</a> (Bti) and <a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis%20aizawa">subspecies "aizawa"</a> (Bta).

Upon sporulation, "B. thuringiensis" forms crystals of <a href="proteinaceous">proteinaceous</a> insecticidal <a href="%CE%B4-endotoxin">δ-endotoxin</a>s (called crystal proteins or Cry proteins), which are encoded by "cry" genes. In most strains of "B. thuringiensis", the "cry" genes are located on a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> ("cry" is not a chromosomal gene in most strains).

Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> (moths and butterflies), <a href="Diptera">Diptera</a> (flies and mosquitoes), <a href="Coleoptera">Coleoptera</a> (beetles), <a href="Hymenoptera">Hymenoptera</a> (<a href="wasp">wasp</a>s, <a href="bee">bee</a>s, <a href="ant">ant</a>s and <a href="sawfly">sawflies</a>) and <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s. Thus, "B. thuringiensis" serves as an important reservoir of Cry toxins for production of biological insecticides and insect-resistant <a href="Genetically%20modified%20food">genetically modified crops</a>. When insects ingest toxin crystals, their alkaline digestive tracts denature the insoluble crystals, making them soluble and thus amenable to being cut with <a href="proteases">proteases</a> found in the insect gut, which liberate the toxin from the crystal. The Cry toxin is then inserted into the insect gut cell membrane, paralyzing the digestive tract and forming a pore. The insect stops eating and starves to death; live Bt bacteria may also colonize the insect which can contribute to death. The midgut bacteria of susceptible larvae may be required for "B. thuringiensis" insecticidal activity.

In 1996 another class of insecticidal proteins in Bt was discovered; the vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip). Vip proteins do not share sequence homology with Cry proteins, in general do not compete for the same receptors, and some kill different insects than do Cry proteins.

In 2000, a novel <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a> of Cry protein, designated parasporin, was discovered from noninsecticidal "B. thuringiensis" isolates. The proteins of parasporin group are defined as "B. thuringiensis" and related bacterial parasporal proteins that are not hemolytic, but capable of preferentially killing cancer cells. As of January 2013, parasporins comprise six subfamilies: PS1 to PS6.

Spores and crystalline insecticidal proteins produced by "B. thuringiensis" have been used to control insect pests since the 1920s and are often applied as liquid sprays. They are now used as specific <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s under trade names such as DiPel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, <a href="wildlife">wildlife</a>, <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s, and most other <a href="beneficial%20insect">beneficial insect</a>s, and are used in <a href="organic%20farming">organic farming</a>; however, the manuals for these products do contain many environmental and human health warnings, and a 2012 European regulatory peer review of five approved strains found, while data exist to support some claims of low toxicity to humans and the environment, the data are insufficient to justify many of these claims.

New strains of Bt are developed and introduced over time as insects develop resistance to Bt, or the desire occurs to force mutations to modify organism characteristics or to use homologous recombinant <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> to improve crystal size and increase pesticidal activity or broaden the host range of Bt and obtain more effective formulations. Each new strain is given a unique number and registered with the U.S. EPA and allowances may be given for genetic modification depending on "its parental strains, the proposed pesticide use pattern, and the manner and extent to which the organism has been genetically modified". Formulations of Bt that are approved for organic farming in the US are listed at the website of the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) and several university extension websites offer advice on how to use Bt spore or protein preparations in organic farming.

The Belgian company <a href="Plant%20Genetic%20Systems">Plant Genetic Systems</a> (now part of <a href="Bayer%20CropScience">Bayer CropScience</a>) was the first company (in 1985) to develop <a href="genetically%20modified%20crops">genetically modified crops</a> (<a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>) with insect tolerance by expressing "cry" genes from "B. thuringiensis"; the resulting crops contain <a href="delta%20endotoxin">delta endotoxin</a>. The Bt tobacco was never commercialized; tobacco plants are used to test genetic modifications since they are easy to manipulate genetically and are not part of the food supply.
In 1995, potato plants producing CRY 3A Bt toxin were approved safe by the <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, making it the first human-modified pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the USA, though many plants produce pesticides naturally, including tobacco, <a href="coffee%20plant">coffee plant</a>s, <a href="Theobroma%20cacao">cocoa</a>, and <a href="black%20walnut">black walnut</a>. This was the 'New Leaf' potato, and it was removed from the market in 2001 due to lack of interest. For current crops and their acreage under cultivation, see <a href="genetically%20modified%20crops">genetically modified crops</a>.

In 1996, <a href="genetically%20modified%20maize">genetically modified maize</a> producing Bt Cry protein was approved, which killed the European corn borer and related species; subsequent Bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae.

The Bt genes engineered into crops and approved for release include, singly and stacked: Cry1A.105, CryIAb, CryIF, Cry2Ab, <a href="Cry3Bb1">Cry3Bb1</a>, Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1, mCry3A, and VIP, and the engineered crops include corn and cotton.

Corn genetically modified to produce VIP was first approved in the US in 2010.

In India, by 2014, more than seven million cotton farmers, occupying twenty-six million acres, had adopted Bt cotton.

<a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a> developed a soybean expressing Cry1Ac and the <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a>-resistance gene for the Brazilian market, which completed the Brazilian regulatory process in 2010.

The use of Bt <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s as <a href="Insecticide%23Plant-incorporated%20protectants">plant-incorporated protectants</a> prompted the need for extensive evaluation of their safety for use in foods and potential unintended impacts on the environment.

Concerns over the safety of consumption of genetically-modified plant materials that contain <a href="Delta%20endotoxin">Cry proteins</a> have been addressed in extensive dietary risk assessment studies. While the target pests are exposed to the toxins primarily through leaf and stalk material, Cry proteins are also expressed in other parts of the plant, including trace amounts in maize kernels which are ultimately consumed by both humans and animals.

Animal models have been used to assess human health risk from consumption of products containing Cry proteins. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recognizes mouse acute oral feeding studies where doses as high as 5,000 mg/kg body weight resulted in <a href="No-observed-adverse-effect%20level">no observed adverse effects</a>. Research on other known toxic proteins suggests that toxicity occurs at much lower doses, further suggesting that Bt toxins are not toxic to mammals. The results of toxicology studies are further strengthened by the lack of observed toxicity from decades of use of "B. thuringiensis" and its crystalline proteins as an insecticidal spray.

Introduction of a new protein raised concerns regarding the potential for allergic responses in sensitive individuals. <a href="Bioinformatics">Bioinformatic</a> analysis of known <a href="allergen">allergen</a>s has indicated there is no concern of <a href="Allergy">allergic reactions</a> as a result of consumption of Bt toxins. Additionally, <a href="Allergy%23Skin%20prick%20testing">skin prick testing</a> using purified Bt protein resulted in no detectable production of toxin-specific <a href="Immunoglobulin%20E">IgE</a> antibodies, even in <a href="Atopy">atopic</a> patients.

Studies have been conducted to evaluate the fate of Bt toxins that are ingested in foods. Bt toxin proteins have been shown to digest within minutes of exposure to simulated <a href="Gastric%20acid">gastric fluids</a>. The instability of the proteins in digestive fluids is an additional indication that Cry proteins are unlikely to be allergenic, since most known food allergens resist degradation and are ultimately <a href="Small%20intestine%23Absorption">absorbed</a> in the small intestine.

Ecological risk assessment aims to ensure there is no unintended impact on non-target organisms and no contamination of natural resources as a result of the use of a new substance, such as the use of Bt in genetically-modified crops. The impact of Bt toxins on the environments where transgenic plants are grown has been evaluated to ensure no adverse effects outside of targeted crop pests.

Concerns over possible environmental impact from accumulation of Bt toxins from plant tissues, pollen dispersal, and direct secretion from roots have been investigated. Bt toxins may persist in soil for over 200 days, with <a href="half-life">half-lives</a> between 1.6 and 22 days. Much of the toxin is initially degraded rapidly by microorganisms in the environment, while some is <a href="adsorbed">adsorbed</a> by organic matter and persists longer. Some studies, in contrast, claim that the toxins do not persist in the soil. Bt toxins are less likely to accumulate in bodies of water, but pollen shed or <a href="soil%20runoff">soil runoff</a> may deposit them in an aquatic ecosystem. Fish species are not susceptible to Bt toxins if exposed.

The toxic nature of Bt proteins has an adverse impact on many major crop pests, but ecological risk assessments have been conducted to ensure safety of beneficial non-target organisms that may come into contact with the toxins. Widespread concerns over toxicity in <a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis%23Lepidopteran%20toxicity">non-target lepidopterans</a>, such as the monarch butterfly, have been disproved through proper exposure characterization, where it was determined that non-target organisms are not exposed to high enough amounts of the Bt toxins to have an adverse effect on the population. Soil-dwelling organisms, potentially exposed to Bt toxins through root exudates, are not impacted by the growth of Bt crops.

In November 2009, <a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a> scientists found the <a href="pink%20bollworm">pink bollworm</a> had become <a href="Pesticide%20resistance">resistant</a> to the first-generation <a href="Bt%20cotton">Bt cotton</a> in parts of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, India - that generation expresses one Bt gene, "Cry1Ac". This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world. Monsanto immediately responded by introducing a second-generation cotton with multiple Bt proteins, which was rapidly adopted. Bollworm resistance to first-generation Bt cotton was also identified in Australia, China, Spain, and the United States.

Several studies have documented surges in "sucking pests" (which are not affected by Bt toxins) within a few years of adoption of Bt cotton. In China, the main problem has been with <a href="mirids">mirids</a>, which have in some cases "completely eroded all benefits from Bt cotton cultivation". The increase in sucking pests depended on local temperature and rainfall conditions and increased in half the villages studied. The increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. Another study in five provinces in China found the reduction in pesticide use in Bt cotton cultivars is significantly lower than that reported in research elsewhere, consistent with the hypothesis suggested by recent studies that more pesticide sprayings are needed over time to control emerging secondary pests, such as aphids, spider mites, and lygus bugs.

Similar problems have been reported in India, with both <a href="mealy%20bugs">mealy bugs</a> and aphids although a survey of small Indian farms between 2002 and 2008 concluded Bt cotton adoption has led to higher yields and lower pesticide use, decreasing over time.

There are controversies around GMOs on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, whether food produced with them is safe, whether such food should be labeled and if so how, whether agricultural biotech is needed to address world hunger now or in the future, and more specifically to GM crops—intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally. There are also issues specific to Bt transgenic crops.

The most publicised problem associated with Bt crops is the claim that pollen from Bt maize could kill the <a href="monarch%20butterfly">monarch butterfly</a>. The paper produced a public uproar and demonstrations against Bt maize; however by 2001 several follow-up studies coordinated by the USDA had asserted that "the most common types of Bt maize pollen are not toxic to monarch larvae in concentrations the insects would encounter in the fields."

A study published in "Nature" in 2001 reported Bt-containing maize genes were found in maize in its center of origin, <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, Mexico. In 2002, paper concluded, "the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper." A significant controversy happened over the paper and "Nature"s unprecedented notice.

A subsequent large-scale study, in 2005, failed to find any evidence of genetic mixing in Oaxaca. A 2007 study found the "transgenic proteins expressed in maize were found in two (0.96%) of 208 samples from farmers' fields, located in two (8%) of 25 sampled communities." Mexico imports a substantial amount of maize from the US, and due to formal and informal seed networks among rural farmers, many potential routes are available for transgenic maize to enter into food and feed webs. One study found small-scale (about 1%) introduction of transgenic sequences in sampled fields in Mexico; it did not find evidence for or against this introduced genetic material being inherited by the next generation of plants. That study was immediately criticized, with the reviewer writing, "Genetically, any given plant should be either nontransgenic or transgenic, therefore for leaf tissue of a single transgenic plant, a GMO level close to 100% is expected. In their study, the authors chose to classify leaf samples as transgenic despite GMO levels of about 0.1%. We contend that results such as these are incorrectly interpreted as positive and are more likely to be indicative of contamination in the laboratory."

As of 2007, a new phenomenon called <a href="colony%20collapse%20disorder">colony collapse disorder</a> (CCD) began affecting <a href="Honey%20bee">bee</a> hives all over North America. Initial speculation on possible causes included new parasites, pesticide use, and the use of Bt transgenic crops. The <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Apiculture%20Research%20and%20Extension%20Consortium">Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium</a> found no evidence that pollen from Bt crops is adversely affecting bees. According to the USDA, "Genetically modified (GM) crops, most commonly Bt corn, have been offered up as the cause of CCD. But there is no correlation between where GM crops are planted and the pattern of CCD incidents. Also, GM crops have been widely planted since the late 1990s, but CCD did not appear until 2006. In addition, CCD has been reported in countries that do not allow GM crops to be planted, such as Switzerland. German researchers have noted in one study a possible correlation between exposure to Bt pollen and compromised immunity to Nosema." The actual cause of CCD was unknown in 2007, and scientists believe it may have multiple exacerbating causes.

Some isolates of "B. thuringiensis" produce a class of insecticidal small molecules called beta-<a href="exotoxin">exotoxin</a>, the common name for which is thuringiensin. A consensus document produced by the OECD says: "Beta-exotoxin and the other "Bacillus" toxins may contribute to the insecticidal toxicity of the bacterium to lepidopteran, dipteran, and coleopteran insects. Beta-exotoxin is known to be toxic to humans and almost all other forms of life and its presence is prohibited in" B. thuringiensis" microbial products. Engineering of plants to contain and express only the genes for δ-endotoxins avoids the problem of assessing the risks posed by these other toxins that may be produced in microbial preparations."

Bacteriophage

A bacteriophage , also known informally as a phage , is a <a href="virus">virus</a> that infects and replicates within a <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a>. The term is derived from "bacteria" and the ("phagein"), "to devour". Bacteriophages are composed of <a href="protein">protein</a>s that <a href="Capsid">encapsulate</a> a <a href="DNA">DNA</a> or <a href="RNA">RNA</a> <a href="genome">genome</a>, and may have relatively simple or elaborate structures. Their genomes may encode <a href="Bacteriophage%20MS2">as few as four</a> genes, and as many as hundreds of <a href="genes">genes</a>. Phages replicate within the bacterium following the injection of their genome into its <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>. Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a>. Bacteriophages are ubiquitous viruses, found wherever bacteria exist. It’s estimated there are more than 10 bacteriophages on the planet, more than every other organism on Earth, including bacteria, combined.

Phages are widely distributed in locations populated by <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>l hosts, such as soil or the intestines of animals. One of the densest natural sources for phages and other viruses is sea water, where up to 9×10 <a href="virus">virions</a> per milliliter have been found in microbial mats at the surface, and up to 70% of marine bacteria may be infected by phages.
They have been used for over 90 years as an alternative to antibiotics in the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and Central Europe, as well as in France. They are seen as a possible therapy against <a href="multi-drug-resistant">multi-drug-resistant</a> strains of many bacteria (see <a href="phage%20therapy">phage therapy</a>). Nevertheless, phages of <a href="Inoviridae">Inoviridae</a> have been shown to complicate biofilms involved in pneumonia and cystic fibrosis, and shelter the bacteria from drugs meant to eradicate disease and promote persistent infection.

Bacteriophages occur abundantly in the biosphere, with different virions, genomes, and lifestyles. Phages are classified by the <a href="International%20Committee%20on%20Taxonomy%20of%20Viruses">International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses</a> (ICTV) according to morphology and nucleic acid.

Nineteen families are currently recognized by the ICTV that infect <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="archaea">archaea</a>. Of these, only two families have RNA genomes, and only five families are enveloped. Of the viral families with DNA genomes, only two have single-stranded genomes. Eight of the viral families with DNA genomes have circular genomes while nine have linear genomes. Nine families infect bacteria only, nine infect archaea only, and one ("Tectiviridae") infects both bacteria and archaea.

In 1896, <a href="Ernest%20Hanbury%20Hankin">Ernest Hanbury Hankin</a> reported that something in the waters of the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> and <a href="Yamuna">Yamuna</a> rivers in <a href="India">India</a> had marked <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> action against <a href="cholera">cholera</a> and could pass through a very fine porcelain filter. In 1915, <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="bacteriologist">bacteriologist</a> <a href="Frederick%20Twort">Frederick Twort</a>, superintendent of the Brown Institution of London, discovered a small agent that infected and killed bacteria. He believed the agent must be one of the following:

Twort's work was interrupted by the onset of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and shortage of funding. Independently, <a href="French-Canadian">French-Canadian</a> <a href="microbiology">microbiologist</a> <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20d%27H%C3%A9relle">Félix d'Hérelle</a>, working at the <a href="Pasteur%20Institute">Pasteur Institute</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, announced on 3 September 1917, that he had discovered "an invisible, antagonistic microbe of the <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> bacillus". For d’Hérelle, there was no question as to the nature of his discovery: "In a flash I had understood: what caused my clear spots was in fact an invisible microbe … a virus parasitic on bacteria." D'Hérelle called the virus a bacteriophage or bacteria-eater (from the Greek "phagein" meaning to eat). He also recorded a dramatic account of a man suffering from dysentery who was restored to good health by the bacteriophages. It was D'Herelle who conducted much research into bacteriophages and introduced the concept of <a href="phage%20therapy">phage therapy</a>.

In 1969, <a href="Max%20Delbr%C3%BCck">Max Delbrück</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Hershey">Alfred Hershey</a> and <a href="Salvador%20Luria">Salvador Luria</a> were awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for their discoveries of the replication of viruses and their genetic structure.

Phages were discovered to be antibacterial agents and were used in the former <a href="Soviet">Soviet</a> Republic of <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> (pioneered there by <a href="Giorgi%20Eliava">Giorgi Eliava</a> with help from the co-discoverer of bacteriophages, Felix d'Herelle) and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> during the 1920s and 1930s for treating bacterial infections. They had widespread use, including treatment of soldiers in the Red Army. However, they were abandoned for general use in the West for several reasons:

Their use has continued since the end of the Cold War in Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. The first regulated, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was reported in the Journal of Wound Care in June 2009, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat infected venous leg ulcers in human patients. The FDA approved the study as a Phase I clinical trial. The study's results demonstrated the safety of therapeutic application of bacteriophages but did not show efficacy. The authors explain that the use of certain chemicals that are part of standard wound care (e.g. <a href="lactoferrin">lactoferrin</a> or silver) may have interfered with bacteriophage viability. Another controlled clinical trial in Western Europe (treatment of ear infections caused by "Pseudomonas aeruginosa") was reported shortly after in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology in August 2009. The study concludes that bacteriophage preparations were safe and effective for treatment of chronic ear infections in humans. Additionally, there have been numerous animal and other experimental clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of bacteriophages for various diseases, such as infected burns and wounds, and cystic fibrosis associated lung infections, among others. Meanwhile, bacteriophage researchers are developing engineered viruses to overcome antibiotic resistance, and engineering the phage genes responsible for coding enzymes which degrade the biofilm matrix, phage structural proteins and also enzymes responsible for lysis of bacterial cell wall.

D'Herelle "quickly learned that bacteriophages are found wherever bacteria thrive: in sewers, in rivers that catch waste runoff from pipes, and in the stools of convalescent patients." This includes rivers traditionally thought to have healing powers, including India's <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> River.

Bacteriophages may have a <a href="lytic%20cycle">lytic cycle</a> or a <a href="lysogenic%20cycle">lysogenic cycle</a>, and a few viruses are capable of carrying out both. With "lytic phages" such as the <a href="T4%20phage">T4 phage</a>, bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages are more suitable for <a href="phage%20therapy">phage therapy</a>. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of <a href="Temperateness%20%28virology%29">temperate phage</a> going dormant and is usually temporary.

In contrast, the "<a href="lysogenic%20cycle">lysogenic cycle</a>" does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as <a href="temperate%20phage">temperate phage</a>s. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a>. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients; then, the <a href="endogenous">endogenous</a> phages (known as <a href="prophage">prophage</a>s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated in all of the cell’s offspring.
An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the <a href="phage%20lambda">phage lambda</a> of "E. coli."

Sometimes prophages may provide benefits to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial <a href="genome">genome</a> in a phenomenon called <a href="lysogenic%20conversion">lysogenic conversion</a>. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of "<a href="Corynebacterium%20diphtheriae">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</a>" or "<a href="Vibrio%20cholerae">Vibrio cholerae</a>" by bacteriophages to highly virulent ones, which cause <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a> or <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, respectively. Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.

To enter a host cell, bacteriophages attach to specific receptors on the surface of bacteria, including <a href="lipopolysaccharide">lipopolysaccharide</a>s, <a href="teichoic%20acid">teichoic acid</a>s, <a href="protein">protein</a>s, or even <a href="flagella">flagella</a>. This specificity means a bacteriophage can infect only certain bacteria bearing receptors to which they can bind, which in turn determines the phage's host range. Host growth conditions also influence the ability of the phage to attach and invade them. As phage virions do not move independently, they must rely on random encounters with the right receptors when in solution (blood, lymphatic circulation, irrigation, soil water, etc.).

Myovirus bacteriophages use a <a href="hypodermic%20syringe">hypodermic syringe</a>-like motion to inject their genetic material into the cell. After making contact with the appropriate receptor, the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell; this is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely, irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts, possibly with the help of <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> present in the tail, injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane.
Podoviruses lack an elongated tail sheath similar to that of a myovirus, so they instead use their small, tooth-like tail fibers enzymatically to degrade a portion of the cell membrane before inserting their genetic material.

Within minutes, bacterial <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, <a href="RNA%20replicase">RNA replicase</a> is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a> so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host’s normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins that help assemble the new virions, or proteins involved in cell <a href="lysis">lysis</a>. <a href="Walter%20Fiers">Walter Fiers</a> (<a href="University%20of%20Ghent">University of Ghent</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene (1972) and of the viral genome of <a href="bacteriophage%20MS2">bacteriophage MS2</a> (1976).

In the case of the <a href="T4%20phage">T4 phage</a>, the construction of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins. The base plates are assembled first, with the tails being built upon them afterward. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with the tails. The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.
Phages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called <a href="endolysin">endolysin</a>, which attacks and breaks down the cell wall <a href="peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a>. An altogether different phage type, the <a href="filamentous%20phage">filamentous phage</a>s, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain "<a href="Mycoplasma">Mycoplasma</a>" phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a <a href="lysogenic">lysogenic</a> cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as <a href="prophage">prophage</a>.

Given the millions of different phages in the environment, phages' genomes come in a variety of forms and sizes. RNA phage such as <a href="Bacteriophage%20MS2">MS2</a> have the smallest genomes of only a few kilobases. However, some DNA phages such as <a href="Enterobacteria%20phage%20T4">T4</a> may have large genomes with hundreds of genes; the size and shape of the <a href="capsid">capsid</a> varies along with the size of the genome.

Bacteriophage genomes can be highly <a href="Mosaic%20%28genetics%29">mosaic</a>, i.e. the genome of many phage species appear to be composed of numerous individual modules. These modules may be found in other phage species in different arrangements. <a href="Mycobacteriophage">Mycobacteriophage</a>s – bacteriophages with <a href="mycobacteria">mycobacteria</a>l hosts – have provided excellent examples of this mosaicism. In these mycobacteriophages, genetic assortment may be the result of repeated instances of <a href="site-specific%20recombination">site-specific recombination</a> and illegitimate recombination (the result of phage genome acquisition of bacterial host genetic sequences). It should be noted, however, that evolutionary mechanisms shaping the genomes of bacterial viruses vary between different families and depend on the type of the nucleic acid, characteristics of the virion structure, as well as the mode of the viral life cycle.

Phages often have dramatic effects on their hosts. As a consequence, the transcription pattern of the infected bacterium may change considerably. For instance, infection of "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>" by the temperate phage PaP3 changed the expression of 38% (2160/5633) of its host's genes. Many of these effects are probably indirect, hence the challenge becomes to identify the direct interactions among bacteria and phage.

Several attempts have been made to map <a href="Protein%E2%80%93protein%20interaction">Protein–protein interaction</a>s among phage and their host. For instance, bacteriophage lambda was found to interact with its host <a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a> by 31 interactions. However, a large-scale study revealed 62 interactions, most of which were new. Again, the significance of many of these interactions remains unclear, but these studies suggest that there are most likely several key interactions and many indirect interactions whose role remains uncharacterized.

<a href="Metagenomics">Metagenomics</a> has allowed the in-water detection of bacteriophages that was not possible previously.

Bacteriophages have also been used in <a href="hydrology">hydrological</a> tracing and modelling in <a href="river">river</a> systems, especially where surface water and <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> interactions occur. The use of phages is preferred to the more conventional <a href="dye">dye</a> marker because they are significantly less absorbed when passing through ground waters and they are readily detected at very low concentrations. Non-polluted water may contain ca. 2×10 bacteriophages per mL.

Bacteriophages are thought to extensively contribute to <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a> in natural environments, principally via <a href="transduction%20%28genetics%29">transduction</a> but also via <a href="transformation%20%28genetics%29">transformation</a>. <a href="Metagenomics">Metagenomics</a>-based studies have also revealed that <a href="virome">viromes</a> from a variety of environments harbor antibiotic resistance genes, including those that could confer <a href="multidrug%20resistance">multidrug resistance</a>.

Since 2006, the <a href="United%20States%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">United States Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) and <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) have approved several bacteriophage products. LMP-102 (Intralytix) was approved for treating ready-to-eat (RTE) poultry and meat products. In that same year, the FDA approved LISTEX (developed and produced by <a href="Micreos%20%28company%29">Micreos</a>) using bacteriophages on cheese to kill "<a href="Listeria%20monocytogenes">Listeria monocytogenes</a>" bacteria, giving them <a href="generally%20recognized%20as%20safe">generally recognized as safe</a> (GRAS) status. In July 2007, the same bacteriophage were approved for use on all food products. In 2011 USDA confirmed that LISTEX is a clean label processing aid and is included in USDA. Research in the field of food safety is continuing to see if lytic phages are a viable option to control other food-borne pathogens in various food products.

In 2011 the FDA cleared the first bacteriophage-based product for in vitro diagnostic use. The KeyPath MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test uses a cocktail of bacteriophage to detect "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>" in positive blood cultures and determine <a href="methicillin">methicillin</a> resistance or susceptibility. The test returns results in about 5 hours, compared to 2–3 days for standard microbial identification and susceptibility test methods. It was the first accelerated antibiotic susceptibility test approved by the FDA.

Government agencies in the West have for several years been looking to <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> for help with exploiting phages for counteracting bioweapons and toxins, such as <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> and <a href="botulism">botulism</a>. Developments are continuing among research groups in the US. Other uses include spray application in horticulture for protecting plants and vegetable produce from decay and the spread of bacterial disease. Other applications for bacteriophages are as biocides for environmental surfaces, e.g., in hospitals, and as preventative treatments for catheters and medical devices before use in clinical settings. The technology for phages to be applied to dry surfaces, e.g., uniforms, curtains, or even sutures for surgery now exists. Clinical trials reported in "Clinical Otolaryngology" show success in veterinary treatment of pet dogs with <a href="otitis">otitis</a>.

<a href="Phage%20display">Phage display</a> is a different use of phages involving a library of phages with a variable peptide linked to a surface protein. Each phage's genome encodes the variant of the protein displayed on its surface (hence the name), providing a link between the peptide variant and its encoding gene. Variant phages from the library can be selected through their binding affinity to an immobilized molecule (e.g., botulism toxin) to neutralize it. The bound, selected phages can be multiplied by reinfecting a susceptible bacterial strain, thus allowing them to retrieve the peptides encoded in them for further study.

The <a href="Sensing%20of%20phage-triggered%20ion%20cascades%20%28SEPTIC%29">SEPTIC</a> bacterium sensing and identification method uses the ion emission and its dynamics during phage infection and offers high specificity and speed for detection.

<a href="Phage-ligand%20technology">Phage-ligand technology</a> makes use of proteins, which are identified from bacteriophages, characterized and recombinantly expressed for various applications such as binding of bacteria and bacterial components (e.g. <a href="endotoxin">endotoxin</a>) and lysis of bacteria.

Bacteriophages are also important <a href="model%20organisms">model organisms</a> for studying principles of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> and <a href="ecology">ecology</a>.

As <a href="antiseptic">antiseptic</a>s (i.e., germicide agents that can be used on human or animal body, skin, mucoses, wounds and the like), few of the above-mentioned disinfectants can be used, under proper conditions (mainly concentration, pH, temperature and toxicity toward humans and animals).

<a href="Aminoglycoside">Aminoglycosidic antibiotics</a> are usually considered bactericidal, although they may be bacteriostatic with some organisms

The distinction between bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents appears to be clear according to the basic/clinical definition, but this only applies under strict laboratory conditions and it is important to distinguish microbiological and clinical definitions. The distinction is more arbitrary when agents are categorized in clinical situations. The supposed superiority of bactericidal agents over bacteriostatic agents is of little relevance when treating the vast majority of infections with <a href="gram-positive%20bacteria">gram-positive bacteria</a>, particularly in patients with uncomplicated infections and noncompromised immune systems. Bacteriostatic agents have been effectively used for treatment that are considered to require bactericidal activity. Furthermore, some broad classes of antibacterial agents considered bacteriostatic can exhibit bactericidal activity against some bacteria on the basis of in vitro determination of MBC/MIC values. At high concentrations, bacteriostatic agents are often bactericidal against some susceptible organisms. The ultimate guide to treatment of any infection must be clinical outcome.

Brion Gysin

Brion Gysin (19 January 1916 – 13 July 1986) was a <a href="Painting">painter</a>, writer, <a href="sound%20poet">sound poet</a>, and <a href="performance%20artist">performance artist</a> born in <a href="Taplow">Taplow</a>, <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>.

He is best known for his discovery of the <a href="cut-up%20technique">cut-up technique</a>, used by his friend, the novelist <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>. With the engineer <a href="Ian%20Sommerville%20%28technician%29">Ian Sommerville</a> he invented the <a href="Dreamachine">Dreamachine</a>, a flicker device designed as an art object to be viewed with the eyes closed. It was in painting and drawing, however, that Gysin devoted his greatest efforts, creating <a href="calligraphic">calligraphic</a> works inspired by the cursive <a href="Japanese%20calligraphy">Japanese "grass" script</a> and <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a>. Burroughs later stated that "Brion Gysin was the only man I ever respected."

John Clifford Brian Gysin was born at the Canadian military hospital in the grounds of Cliveden, Taplow, England. His mother, Stella Margaret Martin, was a Canadian from <a href="Deseronto%2C%20Ontario">Deseronto, Ontario</a>. His father, Leonard Gysin, a captain with the <a href="Canadian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Canadian Expeditionary Force</a>, was killed in action eight months after his son's birth. Stella returned to Canada and settled in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> where her son became "the only Catholic day-boy at an Anglican boarding school". Graduating at fifteen, Gysin was sent to <a href="Downside%20School">Downside School</a> in <a href="Stratton-on-the-Fosse">Stratton-on-the-Fosse</a>, near <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> in England, a prestigious college run by the Benedictines and known as "the Eton of Catholic public schools". Despite, or because of, attending a Catholic school, Gysin became an atheist.

In 1934, he moved to Paris to study "La Civilisation Française", an open course given at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a> where he made literary and artistic contacts through Marie Berthe Aurenche, <a href="Max%20Ernst">Max Ernst</a>'s second wife. He joined the Surrealist Group and began frequenting <a href="Valentine%20Hugo">Valentine Hugo</a>, <a href="Leonor%20Fini">Leonor Fini</a>, <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>, <a href="Picasso">Picasso</a> and <a href="Dora%20Maar">Dora Maar</a>. A year later, he had his first exhibition at the "Galerie Quatre Chemins" in Paris with Ernst, Picasso, <a href="Hans%20Arp">Hans Arp</a>, <a href="Hans%20Bellmer">Hans Bellmer</a>, <a href="Victor%20Brauner">Victor Brauner</a>, <a href="Giorgio%20de%20Chirico">Giorgio de Chirico</a>, Dalí, <a href="Marcel%20Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Magritte">René Magritte</a>, <a href="Man%20Ray">Man Ray</a> and <a href="Yves%20Tanguy">Yves Tanguy</a>. On the day of the preview, however, he was expelled from the Surrealist Group by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breton">André Breton</a>, who ordered the poet <a href="Paul%20%C3%89luard">Paul Éluard</a> to take down his pictures. Gysin was 19 years old. His biographer, John Geiger, suggests the arbitrary expulsion "had the effect of a curse. Years later, he blamed other failures on the Breton incident. It gave rise to conspiracy theories about the powerful interests who seek control of the art world. He gave various explanations for the expulsion, the more elaborate involving 'insubordination' or "lèse majesté" towards Breton".

After serving in the U.S. army during World War II, Gysin published a biography of <a href="Josiah%20Henson">Josiah "Uncle Tom" Henson</a> titled, "To Master, a Long Goodnight: The History of Slavery in Canada" (1946). A gifted draughtsman, he took an 18-month course learning the Japanese language (including calligraphy) that would greatly influence his artwork. In 1949, he was among the first <a href="Fulbright%20Fellow">Fulbright Fellow</a>s. His goal: to research the history of slavery at the University of Bordeaux and in the <a href="Archivo%20de%20Indias">Archivo de Indias</a> in Seville, Spain, a project that he later abandoned. He moved to <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a>, Morocco after visiting the city with novelist and composer <a href="Paul%20Bowles">Paul Bowles</a> in 1950. In 1952/3 he met the travel writer and sexual adventurer <a href="Anne%20Cumming">Anne Cumming</a> and they remained friends until his death.

In 1954 in Tangier, Gysin opened a restaurant called The 1001 Nights, with his friend <a href="Mohamed%20Hamri">Mohamed Hamri</a>, who was the cook. Gysin hired the <a href="Master%20Musicians%20of%20Jajouka">Master Musicians of Jajouka</a> from the village of Jajouka to perform alongside entertainment that included acrobats, a dancing boy and fire eaters. The musicians performed there for an international clientele that included William S. Burroughs. Gysin lost the business in 1958, and the restaurant closed permanently. That same year, Gysin returned to Paris, taking lodgings in a flophouse located at 9 rue Gît-le-Coeur that would become famous as the <a href="Beat%20Hotel">Beat Hotel</a>. Working on a drawing, he discovered a <a href="Dada">Dada</a> technique by accident:
William Burroughs and I first went into techniques of writing, together, back in room No. 15 of the Beat Hotel during the cold Paris spring of 1958... Burroughs was more intent on Scotch-taping his photos together into one great continuum on the wall, where scenes faded and slipped into one another, than occupied with editing the monster manuscript... "<a href="Naked%20Lunch">Naked Lunch</a>" appeared and Burroughs disappeared. He kicked his habit with <a href="Apomorphine">Apomorphine</a> and flew off to London to see Dr Dent, who had first turned him on to the cure. While cutting a mount for a drawing in room No. 15, I sliced through a pile of newspapers with my <a href="Stanley%20knife">Stanley blade</a> and thought of what I had said to Burroughs some six months earlier about the necessity for turning painters' techniques directly into writing. I picked up the raw words and began to piece together texts that later appeared as "First Cut-Ups" in "Minutes to Go" (Two Cities, Paris 1960).

When Burroughs returned from London in September 1959, Gysin not only shared his discovery with his friend but the new techniques he had developed for it. Burroughs then put the techniques to use while completing "<a href="Naked%20Lunch">Naked Lunch</a>" and the experiment dramatically changed the landscape of <a href="American%20literature">American literature</a>. Gysin helped Burroughs with the editing of several of his novels including "<a href="Interzone%20%28book%29">Interzone</a>", and wrote a script for a film version of "Naked Lunch", which was never produced. The pair collaborated on a large manuscript for <a href="Grove%20Press">Grove Press</a> titled "<a href="The%20Third%20Mind">The Third Mind</a>" but it was determined that it would be impractical to publish it as originally envisioned. The book later published under that title incorporates little of this material. Interviewed for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" in 1997, Burroughs explained that Gysin was "the only man that I've ever respected in my life. I've admired people, I've liked them, but he's the only man I've ever respected." In 1969, Gysin completed his finest novel, "<a href="The%20Process%20%28novel%29">The Process</a>", a work judged by critic Robert Palmer as "a classic of 20th century modernism".

A consummate innovator, Gysin altered the cut-up technique to produce what he called permutation poems in which a single phrase was repeated several times with the words rearranged in a different order with each reiteration. An example of this is "I don't dig work, man/Man, work I don't dig." Many of these permutations were derived using a random sequence generator in an early computer program written by <a href="Ian%20Sommerville%20%28technician%29">Ian Sommerville</a>. Commissioned by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in 1960 to produce material for broadcast, Gysin's results included "Pistol Poem", which was created by recording a gun firing at different distances and then splicing the sounds. That year, the piece was subsequently used as a theme for the Paris performance of <a href="Le%20Domaine%20Poetique">Le Domaine Poetique</a>, a showcase for experimental works by people like Gysin, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Dufr%C3%AAne">François Dufrêne</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Heidsieck">Bernard Heidsieck</a>, and <a href="Henri%20Chopin">Henri Chopin</a>.

With Sommerville, he built the <a href="Dreamachine">Dreamachine</a> in 1961. Described as "the first art object to be seen with the eyes closed", the flicker device uses <a href="alpha%20waves">alpha waves</a> in the 8-16 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a> range to produce a change of consciousness in receptive viewers.

In 1985 Gysin was made an American Commander of the French <a href="Ordre%20des%20Arts%20et%20des%20Lettres">Ordre des Arts et des Lettres</a>. He'd begun to work extensively with noted <a href="jazz">jazz</a> soprano saxophonist <a href="Steve%20Lacy">Steve Lacy</a>. They recorded an album in 1986 with French musician Ramuntcho Matta, featuring Gysin singing/rapping his own texts, with performances by Lacy, <a href="Don%20Cherry%20%28jazz%29">Don Cherry</a>, <a href="Elli%20Medeiros">Elli Medeiros</a>, <a href="Lizzy%20Mercier%20Descloux">Lizzy Mercier Descloux</a> and more. The album was reissued on CD in 1993 by <a href="Crammed%20Discs">Crammed Discs</a>, under the title "Self-Portrait Jumping".

On July 13, 1986 Brion Gysin died of <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>. Anne Cumming arranged his funeral and for his ashes to be scattered at the <a href="Caves%20of%20Hercules">Caves of Hercules</a> in Morocco. An obituary by Robert Palmer published in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described him as a man who "threw off the sort of ideas that ordinary artists would parlay into a lifetime career, great clumps of ideas, as casually as a locomotive throws off sparks". Later that year a heavily edited version of his novel, "The Last Museum", was published posthumously by <a href="Faber%20%26amp%3B%20Faber">Faber & Faber</a> (London) and by <a href="Grove%20Press">Grove Press</a> (New York).

As a joke, Gysin had contributed a recipe for <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a> fudge to a cookbook by <a href="Alice%20B.%20Toklas">Alice B. Toklas</a>; it was unintentionally included for publication, becoming famous under the name <a href="Alice%20B.%20Toklas%20brownie">Alice B. Toklas brownie</a>s.

In a 1966 interview by Conrad Knickerbocker for <a href="The%20Paris%20Review">The Paris Review</a>, William S. Burroughs explained that Brion Gysin was, to his knowledge, "the first to create cut-ups".
INTERVIEWER: How did you become interested in the cut-up technique?

BURROUGHS: A friend, Brion Gysin, an American poet and painter, who has lived in Europe for thirty years, was, as far as I know, the first to create cut-ups. His cut-up poem, "Minutes to Go", was broadcast by the BBC and later published in a pamphlet. I was in Paris in the summer of 1960; this was after the publication there of "Naked Lunch". I became interested in the possibilities of this technique, and I began experimenting myself. Of course, when you think of it, "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>" was the first great cut-up collage, and Tristan Tzara had done a bit along the same lines. <a href="Dos%20Passos">Dos Passos</a> used the same idea in 'The Camera Eye' sequences in "<a href="U.S.A.%20trilogy">USA</a>". I felt I had been working toward the same goal; thus it was a major revelation to me when I actually saw it being done.
According to José Férez Kuri, author of "Brion Gysin: Tuning in to the Multimedia Age" (2003) and co-curator of a major retrospective of the artist's work at The Edmonton Art Gallery in 1998, Gysin's wide range of "radical ideas would become a source of inspiration for artists of the <a href="Beat%20Generation">Beat Generation</a>, as well as for their successors (among them <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href="Keith%20Haring">Keith Haring</a>, and <a href="Laurie%20Anderson">Laurie Anderson</a>)". Other artists include <a href="Genesis%20P-Orridge">Genesis P-Orridge</a>, <a href="John%20Zorn">John Zorn</a> (as displayed on the 2013's <a href="Dreamachines">Dreamachines</a> album) and <a href="Brian%20Jones">Brian Jones</a>.

Gysin is the subject of John Geiger's biography, "Nothing Is True Everything Is Permitted: The Life of Brion Gysin", and features in "Chapel of Extreme Experience: A Short History of Stroboscopic Light and the Dream Machine", also by Geiger. "Man From Nowhere: Storming the Citadels of Enlightenment with William Burroughs and Brion Gysin", a biographical study of Burroughs and Gysin with a collection of homages to Gysin, was authored by Joe Ambrose, <a href="Frank%20Rynne">Frank Rynne</a>, and Terry Wilson with contributions by <a href="Marianne%20Faithfull">Marianne Faithfull</a>, <a href="John%20Cale">John Cale</a>, William S.

BCG vaccine

Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a> primarily used against <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. In countries where tuberculosis is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as close to the time of birth as possible. Babies with <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> should not be vaccinated. In areas where tuberculosis is not common, only children at high risk are typically immunized, while suspected cases of tuberculosis are individually tested for and treated. Adults who do not have tuberculosis and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed to drug-resistant tuberculosis may be immunized as well. The vaccine is also often used as part of the treatment of <a href="bladder%20cancer">bladder cancer</a>.
Rates of protection against tuberculosis infection vary widely and protection lasts between ten and twenty years. Among children it prevents about 20% from getting infected and among those who do get infected it protects half from developing disease. The vaccine is given by injection into the skin. Additional doses are not supported by evidence. It may also be used in the treatment of some types of <a href="bladder%20cancer">bladder cancer</a>s.
Serious side effects are rare. Often there is redness, swelling, and mild pain at the site of injection. A small <a href="ulcer">ulcer</a> may also form with some scarring after healing. Side effects are more common and potentially more severe in those with <a href="immunosuppressed">poor immune function</a>. It is not safe for use during <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. The vaccine was originally developed from "<a href="Mycobacterium%20bovis">Mycobacterium bovis</a>" which is commonly found in cows. While it has been weakened, it is still <a href="live%20vaccine">live</a>.
The BCG vaccine was first used medically in 1921. It is on the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization%27s%20List%20of%20Essential%20Medicines">World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines</a>, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a <a href="health%20system">health system</a>. Between 2011 and 2014 the wholesale price was $0.16 to $1.11 USD a dose in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a>. In the United States it costs $100 to $200 USD. As of 2004 the vaccine is given to about 100 million children per year globally.

The main use of BCG is for vaccination against tuberculosis. BCG vaccine can be administered after birth intradermally. BCG vaccination is recommended to be given intradermally. A previous BCG vaccination can cause a <a href="false%20positive">false positive</a> <a href="Mantoux%20test">Mantoux test</a>, although a very high-grade reading is usually due to active disease.

The most controversial aspect of BCG is the variable efficacy found in different clinical trials, which appears to depend on geography. Trials conducted in the UK have consistently shown a protective effect of 60 to 80%, but those conducted elsewhere have shown no protective effect, and efficacy appears to fall the closer one gets to the equator.

A 1994 systematic review found that BCG reduces the risk of getting TB by about 50%. There are differences in effectiveness, depending on region, due to factors such as genetic differences in the populations, changes in environment, exposure to other bacterial infections, and conditions in the lab where the vaccine is grown, including genetic differences between the strains being cultured and the choice of growth medium.

A systematic review and meta analysis conducted in 2014 demonstrated that the BCG vaccine reduced infections by 19–27% and reduced progression to active TB by 71%. The studies included in this review were limited to those that used <a href="interferon%20gamma%20release%20assay">interferon gamma release assay</a>.

The duration of protection of BCG is not clearly known. In those studies showing a protective effect, the data are inconsistent. The MRC study showed protection waned to 59% after 15 years and to zero after 20 years; however, a study looking at Native Americans immunized in the 1930s found evidence of protection even 60 years after immunization, with only a slight waning in efficacy.

BCG seems to have its greatest effect in preventing <a href="Miliary%20tuberculosis">miliary TB</a> or TB meningitis, so it is still extensively used even in countries where efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis is negligible.

A number of possible reasons for the variable efficacy of BCG in different countries have been proposed. None have been proven, some have been disproved, and none can explain the lack of efficacy in both low-TB burden countries (US) and high-TB burden countries (India). The reasons for variable efficacy have been discussed at length in a <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">WHO</a> document on BCG.


BCG has been one of the most successful immunotherapies. BCG vaccine has been the "standard of care for patients with bladder cancer (NMIBC)" since 1977. By 2014 there were more than eight different considered biosimilar agents or strains used for the treatment of non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Except in neonates, a <a href="tuberculin%20skin%20test">tuberculin skin test</a> should always be done before administering BCG. A reactive tuberculin skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors "are already immune" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.

BCG is given as a single <a href="intradermal">intradermal</a> injection at the insertion of the <a href="Deltoid%20muscle">deltoid</a>. If BCG is accidentally given <a href="Subcutaneous%20injection">subcutaneous</a>ly, then a local abscess may form (a "BCG-oma") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with antibiotics immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. However, it is important to note an abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.

The characteristic raised scar BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization. This scar must be distinguished from that of <a href="smallpox%20vaccination">smallpox vaccination</a>, which it may resemble.

BCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection. The main adverse effects are <a href="keloid">keloid</a>s—large, raised scars. The insertion of deltoid is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.

BCG vaccine should be given intradermally. If given subcutaneously, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing either suppurative and nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. Conservative management is usually adequate for nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need needle aspiration. For nonresolving suppuration, surgical excision may be required. Evidence for the treatment of these complications is scarce.

Uncommonly, breast and gluteal abscesses can occur due to haematogenous and lymphangiomatous spread. Regional bone infection (BCG osteomyelitis or osteitis) and disseminated BCG infection are rare complications of BCG vaccination, but potentially life-threatening. Systemic antituberculous therapy may be helpful in severe complications.

If BCG is accidentally given to an immunocompromised patient (e.g., an infant with <a href="severe%20combined%20immune%20deficiency">SCID</a>), it can cause disseminated or life-threatening infection. The documented incidence of this happening is less than one per million immunizations given. In 2007, The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">WHO</a> stopped recommending BCG for infants with <a href="Human%20immunodeficiency%20virus">HIV</a>, even if there is a high risk of exposure to TB, because of the risk of disseminated BCG infection (which is approximately 400 per 100,000 in that higher risk context).

The age of the person and the frequency with which BCG is given has always varied from country to country.


BCG is prepared from a strain of the attenuated (<a href="virulence">virulence</a>-reduced) live bovine tuberculosis bacillus, "<a href="Mycobacterium%20bovis">Mycobacterium bovis</a>", that has lost its ability to cause disease in humans. Because the living bacilli evolve to make the best use of available nutrients, they become less well-adapted to human blood and can no longer induce disease when introduced into a human host. Still, they are similar enough to their wild ancestors to provide some degree of immunity against human tuberculosis. The BCG vaccine can be anywhere from 0 to 80% effective in preventing tuberculosis for a duration of 15 years; however, its protective effect appears to vary according to geography and the lab in which the vaccine strain was grown.

A number of different companies make BCG, sometimes using different genetic strains of the bacterium. This may result in different product characteristics. OncoTICE, used for bladder instillation for bladder cancer, was developed by Organon Laboratories (since acquired by Schering-Plough, and in turn acquired by Merck, Inc.). Pacis BCG, made from the Montréal (Institut Armand-Frappier) strain, was first marketed by Urocor in about 2002. Urocor was since acquired by Dianon Systems. Evans Vaccines (a subsidiary of PowderJect Pharmaceuticals). Statens Serum Institut in Denmark markets BCG vaccine prepared using Danish strain 1331. Japan BCG Laboratory markets its vaccine, based on the Tokyo 172 substrain of Pasteur BCG, in 50 countries worldwide.

According to a UNICEF report published in December 2015 on BCG vaccine supply security, global demand increased in 2015 from 123 to 152.2 million doses. In order to improve security and to [diversify] sources of affordable and flexible supply," UNICEF awarded seven new manufacturers contracts to produce BCG. Along with supply availability from existing manufacturers, and a "new WHO prequalified vaccine" the total supply will be "sufficient to meet both suppressed 2015 demand carried over to 2016, as well as total forecast demand through 2016-2018."

In the fall of 2011 the <a href="Sanofi%20Pasteur">Sanofi Pasteur</a> plant flooded causing problems with mold. The facility, located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, produced BCG vaccine products, made with substrain Connaught, such as a tuberculosis vaccine ImmuCYST, a BCG Immunotherapeutic – a bladder cancer drug. By April 2012 the FDA had found dozens of documented problems with sterility at the plant including mold, nesting birds and rusted electrical conduits. The resulting closure of the plant for over two years resulting in shortages of bladder cancer and tuberculosis vaccines. On October 29, 2014 <a href="Health%20Canada">Health Canada</a> gave the permission for Sanofi to resume production of BCG.

A weakened strain of bovine tuberculosis bacillus, "<a href="Mycobacterium%20bovis">Mycobacterium bovis</a>" is specially subcultured in a culture medium, usually <a href="Middlebrook%207H9%20Broth">Middlebrook 7H9</a>.

Some BCG vaccines are <a href="freeze%20drying">freeze dried</a> and become fine powder. Sometimes the powder are sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.

The history of BCG is tied to that of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. <a href="Jean%20Antoine%20Villemin">Jean Antoine Villemin</a> first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and <a href="Robert%20Koch">Robert Koch</a> first distinguished "Mycobacterium bovis" from "<a href="Mycobacterium%20tuberculosis">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a>". Following the success of <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a> in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and <a href="cowpox">cowpox</a>: it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis. In the late 19th century, clinical trials using "M. bovis" were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because "M. bovis" was found to be just as virulent as "M. tuberculosis".

<a href="Albert%20Calmette">Albert Calmette</a>, a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, <a href="Camille%20Gu%C3%A9rin">Camille Guérin</a>, a veterinarian, were working at the <a href="Institut%20Pasteur%20de%20Lille">Institut Pasteur de Lille</a> (<a href="Lille">Lille</a>, France) in 1908. Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tubercle bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium. The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals. They transferred to the Paris <a href="Pasteur%20Institute">Pasteur Institute</a> in 1919. The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.

Public acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a>, 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.

<a href="Dr.%20R.G.%20Ferguson">Dr. R.G. Ferguson</a>, working at the <a href="Fort%20San%2C%20Saskatchewan">Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium</a> in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> (predecessor to the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">WHO</a>). Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II. From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in <a href="eastern%20Europe">eastern Europe</a> and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.

BCG is very efficacious against <a href="tuberculous%20meningitis">tuberculous meningitis</a> in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the USA and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable Mantoux test and being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).

Other names include "Vaccin Bilié de Calmette et Guérin vaccine" and "Bacille de Calmette et Guérin vaccine".

Tentative evidence exists for a beneficial <a href="non-specific%20effect%20of%20vaccines">non-specific effect</a> of BCG vaccination on overall mortality in low income countries, or for its reducing other health problems including <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a> and respiratory infections when given early, with greater benefit the earlier it is used.

Common buzzard

The common buzzard ("Buteo buteo") is a medium-to-large <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a> whose range covers most of Europe and extends into Asia. Over much of its range, it is resident year-round, but birds from the colder parts of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> typically migrate south (some well into the Southern Hemisphere) for the northern winter.

The first <a href="Species%20description">formal description</a> of the common buzzard was by the Swedish naturalist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1758 in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">tenth edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" under the <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a> "Falco buteo". The genus "Buteo" was introduced by the French naturalist <a href="Bernard%20Germain%20de%20Lac%C3%A9p%C3%A8de">Bernard Germain de Lacépède</a> in 1799 by <a href="tautonymy">tautonymy</a> with the specific name of this species. The word "buteo" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for a buzzard.

Buzzard subspecies fall into two groups.
The western "Buteo" group is mainly resident or short-distance <a href="bird%20migration">migrants</a>. They are:

The eastern "vulpinus" group includes

The common buzzard measures between in length with a wingspan and a body mass of , making it a medium-sized <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptor</a>.

This broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar <a href="rough-legged%20buzzard">rough-legged buzzard</a> ("Buteo lagopus") and the distantly related <a href="European%20honey%20buzzard">European honey buzzard</a> ("Pernis apivorus"), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>s. The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.

Of the two eastern subspecies, "B. b. vulpinus" breeds from east Europe eastward to the Far East (including Eastern China and South Asia), excluding Japan, while "B. b. menetriesi" breeds in the Southern Crimea and Caucasus to northern Iran. "B. b. vulpinus" is a long-distance <a href="bird%20migration">migrant</a>, excepting some north <a href="Himalayas">Himalayan</a> birds, and winters in Africa, India and southeastern Asia. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.

The steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, "B. vulpinus". Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller ( long), longer winged and longer tailed. The two colour morphs are the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name ("vulpes" is Latin for "fox") and a dark grey form.

The tail of "B. vulpinus" is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in "B. b. buteo".

The common buzzard breeds in <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. It eats mainly small <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, and will come to <a href="carrion">carrion</a>. A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.

Buzzards do not normally form <a href="flocks">flocks</a>, but several may be seen together on <a href="Bird%20migration">migration</a> or in good habitat. The <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> writer on <a href="Dartmoor">Dartmoor</a>, <a href="William%20Crossing">William Crossing</a>, noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places. Though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. They are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. This spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.

The call is a plaintive "peea-ay", similar to a cat's <a href="Cat%20communication%23Meow">meow</a>.

In parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. In <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now a common and familiar sight over much of Ireland.

Bohrium

Bohrium is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Bh and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 107. It is named after Danish physicist <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>. It is a <a href="synthetic%20element">synthetic element</a> (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a>; the most stable known <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, Bh, has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of approximately 61 seconds, though the unconfirmed Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690 seconds.

In the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> of the elements, it is a <a href="d-block">d-block</a> <a href="transactinide%20element">transactinide element</a>. It is a member of the <a href="period%207">7th period</a> and belongs to the <a href="group%207%20element">group 7 element</a>s as the fifth member of the 6d series of <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier <a href="homology%20%28chemistry%29">homologue</a> to <a href="rhenium">rhenium</a> in group 7. The <a href="chemical%20properties">chemical properties</a> of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.

Two groups claimed <a href="Timeline%20of%20chemical%20element%20discoveries">discovery of the element</a>. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Russian research team led by <a href="Yuri%20Oganessian">Yuri Oganessian</a>, in which targets of <a href="bismuth-209">bismuth-209</a> and <a href="lead">lead</a>-208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of <a href="chromium">chromium</a>-54 and <a href="manganese">manganese</a>-55 respectively. Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, and the other with an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the <a href="isotope">isotope</a> bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter <a href="dubnium">dubnium</a>-257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive discovery of bohrium at <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a> in 1981. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.

In 1981, a German research team led by <a href="Peter%20Armbruster">Peter Armbruster</a> and <a href="Gottfried%20M%C3%BCnzenberg">Gottfried Münzenberg</a> at the <a href="GSI%20Helmholtz%20Centre%20for%20Heavy%20Ion%20Research">GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research</a> (GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 to produce 5 atoms of the isotope bohrium-262:

This discovery was further substantiated by their detailed measurements of the alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of <a href="fermium">fermium</a> and <a href="californium">californium</a>. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.

The German group suggested the name "nielsbohrium" with symbol "Ns" to honor the Danish physicist <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>. The Soviet scientists at the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called dubnium) and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr and the fact that the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German group's naming proposal for element 107.

There was an <a href="element%20naming%20controversy">element naming controversy</a> as to what the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the <a href="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> adopted "unnilseptium" (symbol "Uns") as a temporary, <a href="systematic%20element%20name">systematic element name</a> for this element. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named "bohrium", not "nielsbohrium", since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element. This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with <a href="boron">boron</a> and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective <a href="oxyanion">oxyanion</a>s, "bohrate" and "borate". The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name "bohrium", and thus the name "bohrium" for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997. It was subsequently decided that oxyanions of bohrium should be called "bohriates" to avoid confusion.

Bohrium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known <a href="metastable%20state">metastable state</a>. All of these but the unconfirmed Bh decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.

The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100 ms for Bh, Bh, Bh, and Bh were observed. Bh, Bh, Bh, and Bh are more stable at around 1 s, and Bh and Bh have half-lives of about 10 s. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with Bh and Bh having measured half-lives of about 61 s and 54 s respectively, and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope Bh appearing to have an even longer half-life of about 690 s. The unknown isotopes Bh and Bh are predicted to have even longer half-lives of around 90 minutes and 40 minutes respectively. Before its discovery, Bh was also predicted to have a long half-life of 90 minutes, but it was found to have a shorter half-life of only about 54 seconds.

The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 265, 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The five most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, 274, and 278 (unconfirmed) appear in the decay chains of Nh, Mc, Mc, Ts, and Fl respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from about ten milliseconds for Bh to about one minute for Bh and Bh, extending to about twelve minutes for the unconfirmed Bh, one of the longest-lived known superheavy nuclides.

Bohrium is the fifth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of <a href="group%207%20element">group 7</a> in the periodic table, below manganese, <a href="technetium">technetium</a> and <a href="rhenium">rhenium</a>. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter <a href="permanganate">permanganate</a>, <a href="pertechnetate">pertechnetate</a>, and <a href="perrhenate">perrhenate</a>. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).

Technetium and rhenium are known to form volatile heptoxides MO (M = Tc, Re), so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide BhO. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO.
Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MOCl, so BhOCl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MOF and MOF for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF and ReF. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties. Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large <a href="dipole">dipole</a> moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcOCl > ReOCl > BhOCl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the <a href="enthalpy">enthalpies</a> of <a href="adsorption">adsorption</a> of these three compounds. The values are for TcOCl and ReOCl are −51 kJ/mol and −61 kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhOCl is −77.8 kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of −78.5 kJ/mol.

Bohrium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a <a href="hexagonal%20close-packed">hexagonal close-packed</a> crystal structure (/ = 1.62), similar to its lighter <a href="congener%20%28chemistry%29">congener</a> rhenium. It should be a very heavy metal with a <a href="density">density</a> of around 37.1 g/cm, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only <a href="meitnerium">meitnerium</a> (37.4 g/cm) and <a href="hassium">hassium</a> (41 g/cm), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, <a href="osmium">osmium</a>, has a density of only 22.61 g/cm. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the <a href="lanthanide%20contraction">lanthanide and actinide contractions</a>, and <a href="relativistic%20quantum%20chemistry">relativistic effects</a>, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.

The atomic radius of bohrium is expected to be around 128 pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Bh ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f 6d 7s, giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues manganese and technetium. Rhenium, on the other hand, follows its heavier congener bohrium in giving up a 5d electron before a 6s electron, as relativistic effects have become significant by the sixth period, where they cause among other things the yellow color of <a href="gold">gold</a> and the low melting point of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>. The Bh ion is expected to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f 6d 7s; in contrast, the Re ion is expected to have a [Xe] 4f 5d configuration, this time analogous to manganese and technetium. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate heptavalent bohrium is expected to be 58 pm (heptavalent manganese, technetium, and rhenium having values of 46, 57, and 53 pm respectively). Pentavalent bohrium should have a larger ionic radius of 83 pm.

In 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent <a href="actinide">actinide</a>s, the <a href="group%205%20element">group 5 element</a>s, and <a href="polonium">polonium</a>.

In 2000, it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves like a typical group 7 element. A team at the <a href="Paul%20Scherrer%20Institute">Paul Scherrer Institute</a> (PSI) conducted a chemistry reaction using six atoms of Bh produced in the reaction between Bk and Ne ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium (as Tc) and rhenium (as Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7. The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium, rhenium, and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcOCl > ReOCl > BhOCl.

Her original plan had been to fly to <a href="California">California</a> on September 10, but she delayed her departure until the next morning so that she could wake up with her husband on his birthday, September 11.

Olson was born Barbara Kay Bracher in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Her older sister, Toni Bracher-Lawrence, was a member of the Houston City Council from 2004 to 2010. She graduated from <a href="Waltrip%20High%20School">Waltrip High School</a> and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the <a href="University%20of%20St.%20Thomas%20%28Houston%29">University of Saint Thomas</a> in Houston. She earned a <a href="Juris%20Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> degree from the <a href="Yeshiva%20University">Yeshiva University</a> <a href="Benjamin%20N.%20Cardozo%20School%20of%20Law">Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law</a>.

As a newcomer, she achieved a surprising measure of success, working for <a href="HBO">HBO</a> and Stacy Keach Productions. In the early 1990s, she worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of <a href="Wilmer%20Cutler%20%26amp%3B%20Pickering">Wilmer Cutler & Pickering</a> where she did civil litigation for several years before becoming an <a href="Assistant%20U.S.%20Attorney">Assistant U.S. Attorney</a>.

Olson's support in 1991 of Supreme Court nominee <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> led to the formation of the <a href="Independent%20Women%27s%20Forum">Independent Women's Forum</a>. At that time, Olson and friend <a href="Rosalie%20%28Ricky%29%20Gaull%20Silberman">Rosalie (Ricky) Gaull Silberman</a> started an informal network of women who supported the Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment by <a href="Anita%20Hill">Anita Hill</a>, a former subordinate of Thomas at the <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>. Olson, who had also worked under Thomas at the EEOC and was a close friend of Thomas, spoke out on his behalf during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings. Olson later helped edit "<a href="The%20Real%20Anita%20Hill">The Real Anita Hill</a>", a book by <a href="David%20Brock">David Brock</a> that savaged Hill and portrayed the harassment claim as a political dirty trick (Brock later recanted his claims and apologized to Hill). The Independent Women's Forum continued on with a goal of retaining a high profile group of women to advocate for economic and political freedom and personal responsibility.

In 1994, Olson became chief investigative counsel for the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Oversight%20and%20Government%20Reform">Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a>.

Barnard's Star

Barnard's Star is a very-low-mass <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> about 6 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away from Earth in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Ophiuchus">Ophiuchus</a>. It is the <a href="list%20of%20nearest%20stars">fourth-nearest</a> known individual star to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> (after the three components of the <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> system) and the closest star in the <a href="Northern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Northern Celestial Hemisphere</a>. Despite its proximity, with a dim <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of +9.5, the star is invisible to the <a href="naked%20eye">unaided eye</a>; it is much brighter in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a> than in <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a>.

The star is named after the American <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Edward%20Emerson%20Barnard">E. E. Barnard</a>. He was not the first to observe the star (it appeared on Harvard University plates in 1888 and 1890), but in 1916 he measured its <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> (which is a function of its close proximity to Earth, and not of its actual <a href="Stellar%20kinematics%23Space%20velocity">space velocity</a>) as 10.3 <a href="minute%20of%20arc">arcsecond</a>s per year, which remains the largest proper motion of any star relative to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. This is likely to be the fastest star, as its close proximity to the Sun, as well as its high velocity make it unlikely any faster object remains undiscovered. In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name "Barnard's Star" for this star on 1 February 2017 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

Barnard's Star is among the most studied red dwarfs because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a>. Historically, research on Barnard's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, its <a href="astrometry">astrometry</a>, and also refining the limits of possible <a href="extrasolar%20planet">extrasolar planet</a>s. Although Barnard's Star is an ancient star, it still experiences <a href="flare%20star">star flare</a> events, one being observed in 1998.

The star has also been the subject of some controversy. For a decade, from the early 1960s to the early 1970s, <a href="Peter%20van%20de%20Kamp">Peter van de Kamp</a> claimed that there were one or more <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a>s in orbit around it. Although the presence of small terrestrial planets around Barnard's Star remains a possibility, Van de Kamp's specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid-1970s.

Barnard's Star is a red dwarf of the dim <a href="stellar%20classification">spectral type</a> M4, and it is too faint to see without a <a href="telescope">telescope</a>. Its <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> is 9.5.

At 7–12 billion years of age, Barnard's Star is considerably older than the Sun, which is 4.5 billion years old, and it might be among the oldest stars in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy. Barnard's Star has lost a great deal of rotational energy, and the periodic slight changes in its brightness indicate that it rotates once in 130 days (the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> rotates in 25). Given its age, Barnard's Star was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity. In 1998, astronomers observed an intense <a href="stellar%20flare">stellar flare</a>, showing that Barnard's Star is a <a href="flare%20star">flare star</a>. Barnard's Star has the <a href="variable%20star%20designation">variable star designation</a> V2500 Ophiuchi. In 2003, Barnard's Star presented the first detectable change in the <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> of a star caused by its motion. Further variability in the radial velocity of Barnard's Star was attributed to its stellar activity.

The proper motion of Barnard's Star corresponds to a relative lateral speed of 90 <a href="kilometers%20per%20second">km/s</a>. The 10.3 seconds of arc it travels annually amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime, roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon.

The radial velocity of Barnard's Star towards the Sun is measured from its <a href="blue%20shift">blue shift</a> to be 110 km/s. Combined with its proper motion, this gives a <a href="Stellar%20kinematics%23Space%20velocity">space velocity</a> (actual velocity relative to the Sun) of 142.6 ± 0.2 km/s. Barnard's Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around AD 11,800, when it will approach to within about 3.75 light-years.

<a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a> is the closest star to the Sun at a position currently 4.24 light-years distant from it. However, despite Barnard's star's even closer pass to the Sun in 11,800 AD, it will still not then be the nearest star, since by that time <a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a> will have moved to a yet nearer proximity to the Sun. At the time of the star's closest pass by the Sun, Barnard's Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye, since its apparent magnitude will only have increased by one magnitude to about 8.5 by then, still being 2.5 magnitudes short of visibility to the naked eye.

Barnard's Star has a mass of about 0.14 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es (), and a radius 15% to 20% of that of the Sun. Thus, although Barnard's Star has roughly 150 times the mass of Jupiter (), its radius is only 1.5 to 2.0 times larger, due to its much higher density. Its <a href="effective%20temperature">effective temperature</a> is 3,100 <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>s, and it has a visual luminosity of 0.0004 <a href="solar%20luminosity">solar luminosities</a>. Barnard's Star is so faint that if it were at the same distance from Earth as the Sun is, it would appear only 100 times brighter than a full moon, comparable to the brightness of the Sun at 80 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s.

Barnard's Star's has 10–32% of the solar <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>. Metallicity is the proportion of stellar mass made up of elements heavier than <a href="helium">helium</a> and helps classify stars relative to the galactic population. Barnard's Star seems to be typical of the old, red dwarf <a href="population%20II%20star">population II star</a>s, yet these are also generally metal-poor <a href="halo%20star">halo star</a>s. While sub-solar, Barnard's Star's metallicity is higher than that of a halo star and is in keeping with the low end of the metal-rich <a href="disk%20star">disk star</a> range; this, plus its high space motion, have led to the designation "intermediate population II star", between a halo and disk star.

For a decade from 1963 to about 1973, a substantial number of astronomers accepted a claim by <a href="Peter%20van%20de%20Kamp">Peter van de Kamp</a> that he had detected, by using <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Astrometry">astrometry</a>, a perturbation in the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of Barnard's Star consistent with its having one or more planets comparable in mass with <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. Van de Kamp had been observing the star from 1938, attempting, with colleagues at the <a href="Swarthmore%20College">Swarthmore College</a> observatory, to find minuscule variations of one <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a> in its position on <a href="photographic%20plate">photographic plate</a>s consistent with <a href="perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">orbital perturbations</a> that would indicate a planetary companion; this involved as many as ten people averaging their results in looking at plates, to avoid systemic individual errors. Van de Kamp's initial suggestion was a planet having about at a distance of 4.4 AU in a slightly eccentric orbit, and these measurements were apparently refined in a 1969 paper. Later that year, Van de Kamp suggested that there were two planets of 1.1 and .

Other astronomers subsequently repeated Van de Kamp's measurements, and two papers in 1973 undermined the claim of a planet or planets. <a href="George%20Gatewood">George Gatewood</a> and Heinrich Eichhorn, at a different observatory and using newer plate measuring techniques, failed to verify the planetary companion. Another paper published by John L. Hershey four months earlier, also using the Swarthmore observatory, found that changes in the astrometric field of various stars correlated to the timing of adjustments and modifications that had been carried out on the refractor telescope's objective lens; the claimed planet was attributed to an artifact of maintenance and upgrade work. The affair has been discussed as part of a broader scientific review.

Van de Kamp never acknowledged any error and published a further claim of two planets' existence as late as 1982; he died in 1995. <a href="Wulff%20Heintz">Wulff Heintz</a>, Van de Kamp's successor at Swarthmore and an expert on <a href="double%20stars">double stars</a>, questioned his findings and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards. The two men were reported to have become estranged from each other because of this.

While not completely ruling out the possibility of planets, null results for planetary companions continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the latest being based on <a href="interferometric">interferometric</a> work with the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 1999. By refining the values of a star's motion, the mass and orbital boundaries for possible planets are tightened: in this way astronomers are often able to describe what types of planets cannot orbit a given star.

M dwarfs such as Barnard's Star are more easily studied than larger stars in this regard because their lower masses render perturbations more obvious. Gatewood was thus able to show in 1995 that planets with were impossible around Barnard's Star, in a paper which helped refine the negative certainty regarding planetary objects in general. In 1999, work with the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> further excluded planetary companions of with an orbital period of less than 1,000 days (Jupiter's orbital period is 4,332 days), while Kuerster determined in 2003 that within the <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a> around Barnard's Star, planets are not possible with an ""M" sin "i"" value greater than 7.5 times the mass of the Earth (), or with a mass greater than 3.1 times the mass of Neptune (much lower than van de Kamp's smallest suggested value).

Even though this research has greatly restricted the possible properties of planets around Barnard's Star, it has not ruled them out completely; <a href="terrestrial%20planets">terrestrial planets</a> would be difficult to detect. <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Space%20Interferometry%20Mission">Space Interferometry Mission</a>, which was to begin searching for extrasolar Earth-like planets, was reported to have chosen Barnard's Star as an early search target. This mission was shut down in 2010. <a href="ESA">ESA</a>'s similar <a href="Darwin%20%28ESA%29">Darwin</a> interferometry mission had the same goal, but was stripped of funding in 2007.

Barnard's Star was studied as part of <a href="Project%20Daedalus">Project Daedalus</a>. Undertaken between 1973 and 1978, the study suggested that rapid, unmanned travel to another star system was possible with existing or near-future technology. Barnard's Star was chosen as a target partly because it was believed to have planets.

The theoretical model suggested that a nuclear pulse rocket employing <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> (specifically, electron bombardment of <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> and <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a>) and accelerating for four years could achieve a velocity of 12% of the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. The star could then be reached in 50 years, within a human lifetime. Along with detailed investigation of the star and any companions, the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> would be examined and baseline astrometric readings performed.

The initial Project Daedalus model sparked further theoretical research. In 1980, <a href="Robert%20Freitas">Robert Freitas</a> suggested a more ambitious plan: a <a href="self-replicating%20spacecraft">self-replicating spacecraft</a> intended to search for and make contact with <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial life</a>. Built and launched in <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s orbit, it would reach Barnard's Star in 47 years under parameters similar to those of the original Project Daedalus. Once at the star, it would begin automated self-replication, constructing a factory, initially to manufacture exploratory probes and eventually to create a copy of the original spacecraft after 1,000 years.

In 1998 a <a href="stellar%20flare">stellar flare</a> on Barnard's Star was detected based on changes in the <a href="spectral%20emissions">spectral emissions</a> on July 17, 1998, during an unrelated search for variations in the proper motion. Four years passed before the flare was fully analyzed, at which point it was suggested that the flare's temperature was 8000 K, more than twice the normal temperature of the star. Given the essentially random nature of flares, Diane Paulson, one of the authors of that study, noted that "the star would be fantastic for amateurs to observe".
The flare was surprising because intense stellar activity is not expected in stars of such age. Flares are not completely understood, but are believed to be caused by strong <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s, which suppress <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> <a href="convection">convection</a> and lead to sudden outbursts: strong magnetic fields occur in rapidly rotating stars, while old stars tend to rotate slowly. For Barnard's Star to undergo an event of such magnitude is thus presumed to be a rarity. Research on the star's periodicity, or changes in stellar activity over a given timescale, also suggest it ought to be quiescent; 1998 research showed weak evidence for periodic variation in the star's brightness, noting only one possible starspot over 130 days.

Stellar activity of this sort has created interest in using Barnard's Star as a proxy to understand similar stars. It is hoped that photometric studies of its <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> and <a href="Ultraviolet">UV</a> emissions will shed light on the large population of old M dwarfs in the galaxy. Such research has <a href="astrobiology">astrobiological</a> implications: given that the habitable zones of M dwarfs are close to the star, any planets would be strongly influenced by solar flares, winds, and plasma ejection events.

Barnard's Star shares much the same neighborhood as the Sun. The neighbors of Barnard's Star are generally of red dwarf size, the smallest and most common star type. Its closest neighbor is currently the red dwarf <a href="Ross%20154">Ross 154</a>, at 1.66 parsecs (5.41 light-years) distance. The Sun and <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> are, respectively, the next closest systems. From Barnard's Star, the Sun would appear on the diametrically opposite side of the sky at coordinates RA=, Dec=, in the eastern part of the constellation <a href="Monoceros">Monoceros</a>. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83, and at a distance of 1.834 parsecs, it would be a first-magnitude star, as <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a> is from the Earth.

<doc id="4199" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4199" title="Bayer designation">
Bayer designation

A Bayer designation is a <a href="stellar%20designation">stellar designation</a> in which a specific star is identified by a <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek letter</a>, followed by the <a href="genitive%20case">genitive</a> form of its parent constellation's <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> name. The original list of Bayer designations contained 1,564 stars.

Most of the brighter stars were assigned their first systematic names by the German <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> in 1603, in his star atlas "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>". Bayer assigned a lower-case Greek letter, such as alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), etc., to each star he catalogued, combined with the Latin name of the star’s parent constellation in <a href="genitive%20case">genitive</a> (possessive) form. (See <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> for the genitive forms.) For example, <a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a> is designated "α Tauri" (pronounced "Alpha Tauri"), which means "Alpha of <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">the constellation Taurus</a>".

A single constellation may contain fifty or more stars visible to the naked eye, but the Greek alphabet has only twenty-four letters. When these ran out, Bayer began using Latin letters: upper case "A", followed by lower case "b" through "z" (omitting "j" and "v"), for a total of another 24 letters. Bayer never went beyond "z", but later astronomers added more designations using both upper and lower case Latin letters, the upper case letters following the lower case ones in general. Examples include "<a href="HD%2090853">s Carinae</a>" ("s" of <a href="Carina%20%28constellation%29">the constellation Carina</a>), "<a href="HD%20117440">d Centauri</a>" ("d" of <a href="Centaurus">the constellation Centaurus</a>), "<a href="G%20Scorpii">G Scorpii</a>" ("G" of <a href="Scorpius%20%28constellation%29">the constellation Scorpius</a>), and "<a href="HD%2082668">N Velorum</a>" ("N" of <a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">the constellation Vela</a>). The last upper-case letter used in this way was "Q".

Bayer catalogued only a few stars too far south to be seen from Germany, but later astronomers (notably <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Lacaille</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Gould</a>) supplemented Bayer's catalog with entries for southern constellations.

In most constellations, Bayer assigned Greek and Latin letters to stars within a constellation in rough order of <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent brightness</a>, from brightest to dimmest. Since the brightest star in a majority of constellations is designated Alpha (α), many people wrongly assume that Bayer meant to order the stars exclusively by brightness. In Bayer's day, however, stellar brightness could not be measured precisely. Stars were traditionally assigned to one of six magnitude classes (the brightest to first magnitude, the dimmest to sixth), and Bayer typically ordered stars within a constellation by class: all the first-magnitude stars, followed by all the second-magnitude stars, and so on. Within each magnitude class, Bayer made no attempt to arrange stars by relative brightness. As a result, the brightest star in each class did not always get listed first in Bayer's order.

But in addition, Bayer did not always follow the magnitude class rule; he sometimes assigned letters to stars according to their location within a constellation, or the order of their rising, or to historical or mythological details. Occasionally the order looks quite arbitrary.

Of the 88 modern constellations, there are at least 30 in which "Alpha" is not the brightest star, and four of those lack an alpha star altogether. (Constellations with no alpha include <a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">Vela</a> and <a href="Puppis">Puppis</a> – both formerly part of <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a>, whose alpha is <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a> in <a href="Carina%20%28constellation%29">Carina</a>.)

<a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> provides a good example of Bayer's method. Bayer first designated Betelgeuse and Rigel, the two 1st-magnitude stars (those of magnitude 1.5 or less), as Alpha and Beta from north to south, with Betelgeuse (the shoulder) coming ahead of Rigel (the foot), even though the latter is usually the brighter. (Betelgeuse is a variable star and can at its maximum occasionally outshine Rigel.) Bayer then repeated the procedure for the stars of the 2nd magnitude (those between magnitudes 1.51 and 2.5), labeling them from "gamma" through "zeta" in "top-down" (north-to-south) order.

The "First to Rise in the East" order is used in a number of instances. <a href="Castor%20%28star%29">Castor</a> and <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a> of <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini</a> may be an example of this: Pollux is brighter than Castor, but the latter rises earlier and was assigned "alpha". In this case, Bayer may also have been influenced by the traditional order of the mythological names "<a href="Castor%20and%20Pollux">Castor and Pollux</a>": Castor is generally named first whenever the twins are mentioned.

Although the brightest star in Draco is Eltanin (<a href="Gamma%20Draconis">Gamma Draconis</a>), <a href="Thuban">Thuban</a> was assigned "alpha" (α) by Bayer because, due to <a href="precession">precession</a>, Thuban was the <a href="pole%20star">north pole star</a> 4,000 years ago. Sometimes there is no apparent order, as exemplified by the stars in <a href="Sagittarius%20%28constellation%29">Sagittarius</a>, where Bayer's designations appear almost random to the modern eye. <a href="Alpha%20Sagittarii">Alpha</a> and <a href="Beta%20Sagittarii">Beta Sagittarii</a> are perhaps the most anomalously designated stars in the sky. They are more than two magnitudes fainter than the brightest star (designated <a href="Epsilon%20Sagittarii">Epsilon</a>), they lie several degrees south of the main pattern (the "teapot" <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a>), they are more than 20 degrees off the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a> in a <a href="Zodiac">Zodiac</a>al constellation, and they do not even rise from Bayer's native Germany (while Epsilon and several other brighter stars do). The order of the letters assigned in Sagittarius does correspond to the magnitudes as illustrated on Bayer's chart; but the latter do not agree with modern determinations of the magnitudes.

Bayer designations added by later astronomers generally were ordered by magnitude, but care was usually taken to avoid conflict with designations already assigned. In Libra, for example, the new designations sigma, tau, and upsilon were chosen to avoid conflict with Bayer's earlier designations, even though several stars with earlier letters are not as bright.

Although Bayer did not use upper-case Latin letters (except "A") for "fixed stars", he did use them to label other items shown on his charts, such as neighboring constellations, "temporary stars", miscellaneous astronomical objects, or reference lines like the Tropic of Cancer. In <a href="Cygnus%20%28constellation%29">Cygnus</a>, for example, Bayer's fixed stars run through "g", and on this chart Bayer employs "H" through "P" as miscellaneous labels, mostly for neighboring constellations. Bayer did not intend such labels as catalog designations, but some have survived to refer to astronomical objects: <a href="P%20Cygni">P Cygni</a> for example is still used as a designation for Nova Cyg 1600. Tycho's Star (<a href="SN%201572">SN 1572</a>), another "temporary star", appears as B Cassiopeiae. In charts for constellations that did not exhaust the Greek letters, Bayer sometimes used the left-over Greek letters for miscellaneous labels as well.

<a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> designated four stars as "border stars", each shared by two constellations: Alpheratz (in <a href="Andromeda%20%28constellation%29">Andromeda</a> and <a href="Pegasus%20%28constellation%29">Pegasus</a>), Elnath (in <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a> and <a href="Auriga%20%28constellation%29">Auriga</a>), Nu Boötis (in <a href="Bo%C3%B6tes">Boötes</a> and <a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Hercules</a>), and Fomalhaut (in <a href="Piscis%20Austrinus">Piscis Austrinus</a> and <a href="Aquarius%20%28constellation%29">Aquarius</a>). Bayer assigned the first three of these stars a Greek letter from both constellations: , , and . (He catalogued Fomalhaut only once, as <a href="Fomalhaut">Alpha Piscis Austrini</a>.) When the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) assigned definite boundaries to the constellations in 1930, it declared that stars and other celestial objects can belong to only one constellation. Consequently, the redundant second designation in each pair above has dropped out of use.

Bayer assigned two stars duplicate names by mistake: (duplicated as ) and (duplicated as ). He corrected these in a later atlas, and the duplicate names were no longer used.

Other cases of multiple Bayer designations arose when stars named by Bayer in one constellation were transferred by later astronomers to a different constellation. Bayer's Gamma and Omicron Scorpii, for example, were later reassigned from <a href="Scorpius">Scorpius</a> to <a href="Libra%20%28constellation%29">Libra</a> and given the new names <a href="Sigma%20Librae">Sigma</a> and <a href="Upsilon%20Librae">Upsilon Librae</a>. (To add to the confusion, the star now known as <a href="Omicron%20Scorpii">Omicron Scorpii</a> was not named by Bayer but was assigned the designation o Scorpii (Latin lower case 'o') by Lacaille – which later astronomers misinterpreted as omicron once Bayer's omicron had been reassigned to Libra.)

A few stars no longer lie (according to the modern constellation boundaries) within the constellation for which they are named. The <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of <a href="Rho%20Aquilae">Rho Aquilae</a>, for example, carried it across the boundary into <a href="Delphinus">Delphinus</a> in 1992.

Bayer designations are most often written as the Greek or Latin letter followed by the standard 3-character constellation abbreviation: α CMa, β Per; or occasionally with the constellation genitive in full: α Canis Majoris, β Persei. Earlier 4-letter abbreviations (α CMaj, β Pers) are rarely used today. The Greek letter names are sometimes written out as well: <a href="Alpha%20Canis%20Majoris">Alpha Canis Majoris</a>, <a href="Beta%20Persei">Beta Persei</a>.

The Latin-letter extended designations are not as commonly used as the Greek-letter ones (especially in constellations with <a href="Flamsteed%20designation">Flamsteed designation</a>s), but there are some exceptions such as <a href="h%20Persei">h Persei</a> (which is actually a <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a>) and <a href="P%20Cygni">P Cygni</a>. Uppercase Latin Bayer designations in modern use do not go beyond Q; names such as <a href="R%20Leporis">R Leporis</a> and <a href="W%20Ursae%20Majoris">W Ursae Majoris</a> are <a href="variable%20star%20designation">variable star designation</a>s, not Bayer designations.

A further complication is the use of numeric superscripts to distinguish neighboring stars that Bayer (or a later astronomer) labeled with a common letter. Usually these are <a href="double%20star">double star</a>s (mostly optical doubles rather than true <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>s), but there are some exceptions such as the chain of stars <a href="Pi1%20Orionis">π</a>, <a href="Pi2%20Orionis">π</a>, <a href="Pi3%20Orionis">π</a>, <a href="Pi4%20Orionis">π</a>, <a href="Pi5%20Orionis">π</a> and <a href="Pi6%20Orionis">π</a> <a href="Pi%20Orionis">Orionis</a>.

Bayer did not label "permanent" stars with uppercase letters (except for "A", which he used in place of "a"). However, a number of stars in southern constellations have upper-case letter designations, like <a href="B%20Centauri">B Centauri</a> and <a href="G%20Scorpii">G Scorpii</a>. These letters were assigned by later astronomers, notably Lacaille in his "Coelum Australe Stelliferum" and Gould in his "Uranometria Argentina". Lacaille followed Bayer's use of Greek letters, but this was insufficient for many constellations. He used first the lowercase letters, starting with "a", and if needed the uppercase letters, starting with "A", thus deviating somewhat from Bayer's practice. Lacaille used the Latin alphabet three times over in the large constellation <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a>, once for each of the three areas that are now the constellations of <a href="Carina%20%28constellation%29">Carina</a>, <a href="Puppis">Puppis</a>, and <a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">Vela</a>. That was still insufficient for the number of stars, so he also used uppercase Latin letters such as <a href="HD%2082668">N Velorum</a> and <a href="Q%20Puppis">Q Puppis</a>. Lacaille assigned uppercase letters between R and Z in several constellations, but these have either been dropped to allow the assignment of those letters to variable stars or have actually turned out to be variable.

Boötes

Boötes is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the northern sky, located between 0° and +60° <a href="declination">declination</a>, and 13 and 16 hours of <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> on the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>. The name comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> Βοώτης, "Boōtēs", meaning "<a href="herder">herdsman</a>" or "<a href="plowman">plowman</a>" (literally, "ox-driver"; from βοῦς "bous" “cow”).

One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd-century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, Boötes is now one of the 88 <a href="modern%20constellation">modern constellation</a>s. It contains the <a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">fourth-brightest star</a> in the night sky, the orange giant star <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a>. Epsilon Bootis, or Izar, is a colourful multiple star popular with amateur astronomers. Boötes is home to many other bright stars, including eight above the fourth magnitude and an additional 21 above the fifth magnitude, making a total of 29 stars easily visible to the naked eye.

In <a href="Babylon">ancient Babylon</a>, the stars of Boötes were known as SHU.PA. They were apparently depicted as the god <a href="Enlil">Enlil</a>, who was the leader of the Babylonian pantheon and special patron of farmers. Boötes may have been represented by the <a href="Foreleg%20of%20ox">foreleg</a> constellation in ancient Egypt. According to this interpretation, the constellation depicts the shape of an animal foreleg. 

The name "Boötes" was first used by <a href="Homer">Homer</a> in his <a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> as a celestial reference point for <a href="History%20of%20navigation%23Antiquity">navigation</a>, described as "late-setting" or "slow to set", translated as the "Plowman". Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> is not clear. According to one version, he was a son of <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a>, <a href="Philomenus">Philomenus</a>, twin brother of <a href="Plutus">Plutus</a>, a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a>. This is corroborated by the constellation's name, which itself means "ox-driver" or "herdsman." The ancient Greeks saw the <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> now called the "<a href="Big%20Dipper">Big Dipper</a>" or "Plough" as a cart with oxen. This influenced the name's etymology, derived from the Greek for "noisy" or "ox-driver". Another myth associated with Boötes tells that he invented the <a href="plow">plow</a> and was memorialized for his ingenuity as a constellation.

Another myth associated with Boötes by <a href="Hyginus">Hyginus</a> is that of <a href="Icarius">Icarius</a>, who was schooled as a grape farmer and winemaker by <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. Icarius made wine so strong that those who drank it appeared poisoned, which caused shepherds to avenge their supposedly poisoned friends by killing Icarius. <a href="Maera%20%28hound%29">Maera</a>, Icarius' dog, brought his daughter <a href="Erigone%20%28daughter%20of%20Icarius%29">Erigone</a> to her father's body, whereupon both she and the dog committed suicide. Zeus then chose to honor all three by placing them in the sky as constellations: Icarius as Boötes, Erigone as <a href="Virgo%20%28constellation%29">Virgo</a>, and Maera as <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a> or <a href="Canis%20Minor">Canis Minor</a>.

Following another reading, the constellation is identified with <a href="Arcas">Arcas</a> and also referred to as Arcas and Arcturus, son of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Callisto%20%28mythology%29">Callisto</a>. Arcas was brought up by his maternal grandfather <a href="Lycaon%20%28Arcadia%29">Lycaon</a>, to whom one day Zeus went and had a meal. To verify that the guest was really the king of the gods, Lycaon killed his grandson and prepared a meal made from his flesh. Zeus noticed and became very angry, transforming Lycaon into a wolf and gave back life to his son. In the meantime Callisto had been transformed into a she-bear, by Zeus's wife, <a href="Hera">Hera</a>, who was angry at Zeus's infidelity. This is corroborated by the Greek name for Boötes, "Arctophylax", which means "Bear Watcher". Callisto in form of a bear was almost killed by her son who was out hunting. Zeus rescued her, taking her into the sky where she became Ursa Major, "the Great Bear". The name Arcturus (the constellation's brightest star) comes from the Greek word meaning "guardian of the bear". Sometimes <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> is depicted as leading the hunting dogs of nearby <a href="Canes%20Venatici">Canes Venatici</a> and driving the bears of Ursa Major and <a href="Ursa%20Minor">Ursa Minor</a>.

Several <a href="former%20constellations">former constellations</a> were formed from stars now included in Boötes. <a href="Quadrans%20Muralis">Quadrans Muralis</a>, the Quadrant, was a constellation created near Beta Boötis from faint stars. It was invented in 1795 by <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Lalande">Jérôme Lalande</a>, an astronomer who used a <a href="quadrant%20%28instrument%29">quadrant</a> to perform detailed <a href="astrometry">astronometric measurements</a>. Lalande worked with <a href="Nicole-Reine%20Lepaute">Nicole-Reine Lepaute</a> and others to predict the 1758 return of <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a>. Quadrans Muralis was formed from the stars of eastern Boötes, western <a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Hercules</a>, and <a href="Draco%20%28constellation%29">Draco</a>. It was originally called "Le Mural" by <a href="Jean%20Fortin">Jean Fortin</a> in his 1795 <a href="Atlas%20C%C3%A9leste">Atlas Céleste</a>; it was not given the name "Quadrans Muralis" until <a href="Johann%20Bode">Johann Bode</a>'s 1801 "Uranographia". The constellation was quite faint, with its brightest stars reaching the 5th magnitude. <a href="Mons%20Maenalus">Mons Maenalus</a>, representing the <a href="Maenalus">Maenalus</a> mountains, was created by <a href="Johannes%20Hevelius">Johannes Hevelius</a> in 1687 at the foot of the constellation's figure. The mountain was named for the son of Lycaon, <a href="Maenalus">Maenalus</a>. The mountain, one of <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a>'s hunting grounds, was also holy to <a href="Pan%20%28mythology%29">Pan</a>.

The stars of Boötes were incorporated into many different <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese constellations</a>. Arcturus was part of the most prominent of these, variously designated as the celestial king's throne ("Tian Wang") or the Blue Dragon's horn ("Daijiao"); the name "Daijiao", meaning "great horn", is more common. Arcturus was given such importance in Chinese celestial mythology because of its status marking the beginning of the lunar calendar, as well as its status as the brightest star in the northern night sky. Two constellations flanked "Daijiao", "Yousheti" to the right and "Zuosheti" to the left; they represented companions that orchestrated the seasons. "Zuosheti" was formed from modern <a href="Zeta%20Bootis">Zeta</a>, <a href="Omicron%20Bootis">Omicron</a>, and <a href="Pi%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Pi Boötis</a>, while "Yousheti" was formed from modern <a href="Eta%20Bootis">Eta</a>, <a href="Tau%20Bootis">Tau</a>, and <a href="Upsilon%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Upsilon Boötis</a>. "Dixi", the Emperor's ceremonial banquet mat, was north of Arcturus, consisting of the stars <a href="12%20Bootis">12</a>, <a href="11%20Bootis">11</a>, and <a href="9%20Bo%C3%B6tis">9 Boötis</a>. Another northern constellation was "Qigong", the Seven Dukes, which was mostly across the Boötes-Hercules border. It included either <a href="Delta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Delta Boötis</a> or <a href="Beta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Beta Boötis</a> as its terminus.

The other Chinese constellations made up of the stars of Boötes existed in the modern constellation's north; they are all representations of weapons. "Tianqiang", the spear, was formed from <a href="Iota%20Bootis">Iota</a>, <a href="Kappa%20Bootis">Kappa</a>, and <a href="Theta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Theta Boötis</a>; "Genghe", variously representing a lance or shield, was formed from <a href="Epsilon%20Bootis">Epsilon</a>, <a href="Rho%20Bootis">Rho</a>, and <a href="Sigma%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Sigma Boötis</a>. There were also two weapons made up of a singular star. "Xuange", the <a href="halberd">halberd</a>, was represented by <a href="Lambda%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Lambda Boötis</a>, and "Zhaoyao", either the sword or the spear, was represented by <a href="Gamma%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Gamma Boötis</a>.

Two Chinese constellations have an uncertain placement in Boötes. "Kangchi", the lake, was placed south of Arcturus, though its specific location is disputed. It may have been placed entirely in Boötes, on either side of the Boötes-Virgo border, or on either side of the Virgo-Libra border. The constellation "Zhouding", a bronze tripod-mounted container used for food, was sometimes cited as the stars <a href="1%20Bootis">1</a>, <a href="2%20Bootis">2</a>, and <a href="6%20Bo%C3%B6tis">6 Boötis</a>. However, it has also been associated with three stars in Coma Berenices.

Boötes is also known to North American cultures. In <a href="Central%20Alaskan%20Yup%27ik">Yup'ik</a> Boötes is "Taluyaq", literally "fish trap," and the funnel shaped part of the fish trap is known as "Ilulirat."

Boötes is a constellation bordered by Virgo to the south, <a href="Coma%20Berenices">Coma Berenices</a> and Canes Venatici to the west, Ursa Major to the northwest, Draco to the northeast, and <a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Hercules</a>, <a href="Corona%20Borealis">Corona Borealis</a> and <a href="Serpens%20Caput">Serpens Caput</a> to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Boo'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates stretch from +7.36° to +55.1°. Covering 907 square degrees, Boötes <a href="culmination">culminates</a> at midnight around 2 May and ranks 13th in area.

Colloquially, its pattern of stars has been likened to a kite or ice cream cone. However, depictions of Boötes have varied historically. <a href="Aratus">Aratus</a> described him circling the north pole, herding the two bears. Later ancient Greek depictions, described by Ptolemy, have him holding the reins of his hunting dogs (Canes Venatici) in his left hand, with a spear, club, or staff in his right hand. After Hevelius introduced Mons Maenalus in 1681, Boötes was often depicted standing on the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> mountain. By 1801, when Johann Bode published his "Uranographia", Boötes had acquired a sickle, which was also held in his left hand.

The placement of Arcturus has also been mutable through the centuries. Traditionally, Arcturus lay between his thighs, as Ptolemy depicted him. However, <a href="Germanicus%20Caesar">Germanicus Caesar</a> deviated from this tradition by placing Arcturus "where his garment is fastened by a knot".

In his "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>", <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> used the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek letters</a> Alpha through to Omega and then A to k to label what he saw as the most prominent 35 stars in the constellation, with subsequent astronomers splitting Kappa, Mu, Nu and Pi as two stars each. Nu is also the same star as Psi Herculis. <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> numbered 54 stars for the constellation.

Located 36.7 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth, <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a>, or Alpha Boötis, is the brightest star in Boötes and the fourth-brightest star in the sky at an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of −0.05; It is also the brightest star north of the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a>, just shading out <a href="Vega">Vega</a> and <a href="Capella">Capella</a>. Its name comes from the Greek for "bear-keeper". An <a href="orange%20giant">orange giant</a> of <a href="spectral%20class">spectral class</a> K1.5III, Arcturus is an ageing star that has exhausted its core supply of hydrogen and cooled and expanded to a diameter of 27 <a href="solar%20diameter">solar diameter</a>s, equivalent to approximately 32 million kilometers. Though its mass is approximately one <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a> (), Arcturus shines with 133 times the <a href="solar%20luminosity">luminosity of the Sun</a> (). 

Bayer located Arcturus above the herdsman's left knee in his "Uranometria". Nearby <a href="Eta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Eta Boötis</a>, or Muphrid, is the uppermost star denoting the left leg. It is a 2.68-magnitude star 37 light-years distant with a spectral class of G0IV, indicating it has just exhausted its core hydrogen and is beginning to expand and cool. It is 9 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.7 times its diameter. Analysis of its spectrum reveals that it is a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a>. Muphrid and Arcturus lie only 3.3 light-years away from each other. Viewed from Arcturus, Muphrid would have a visual magnitude of -2½, while Arcturus would be around visual magnitude -4½ when seen from Muphrid.

Marking the herdsman's head is Beta Boötis, or Nekkar, a <a href="yellow%20giant">yellow giant</a> of magnitude 3.5 and spectral type G8IIIa. Like Arcturus, it has expanded and cooled off the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>—likely to have lived most of its stellar life as a blue-white <a href="B-type%20main%20sequence%20star">B-type main sequence star</a>. Its common name comes from the Arabic phrase for "ox-driver". It is 219 light-years away and has a luminosity of . 

Located 86 light-years distant, <a href="Gamma%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Gamma Boötis</a>, or Seginus, is a white giant star of spectral class A7III, with a luminosity 34 times and diameter 3.5 times that of the Sun. It is a <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a>, ranging between magnitudes 3.02 and 3.07 every 7 hours. These stars are short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Standard%20candles">standard candles</a> and as subjects to study <a href="astroseismology">astroseismology</a>. 

<a href="Delta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Delta Boötis</a> is a wide double star with a primary of magnitude 3.5 and a secondary of magnitude 7.8. The primary is a yellow giant that has cooled and expanded to 10.4 times the diameter of the Sun. Of spectral class G8IV, it is around 121 light-years away, while the secondary is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. The two are thought to take 120,000 years to orbit each other. 

<a href="Mu%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Mu Boötis</a>, known as <a href="Alkalurops">Alkalurops</a>, is a triple star popular with amateur astronomers. It has an overall magnitude of 4.3 and is 121 light-years away. Its name is from the Arabic phrase for "club" or "staff". The primary appears to be of magnitude 4.3 and is blue-white. The secondary appears to be of magnitude 6.5, but is actually a close double star itself with a primary of magnitude 7.0 and a secondary of magnitude 7.6. The secondary and tertiary stars have an orbital period of 260 years. The primary has an absolute magnitude of 2.6 and is of spectral class F0. The secondary and tertiary stars are separated by 2 arcseconds; the primary and secondary are separated by 109.1 arcseconds at an angle of 171 degrees. 

<a href="Nu%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Nu Boötis</a> is an optical double star. The primary is an orange giant of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 5.0. The primary is 870 light-years away and the secondary is 430 light-years.

<a href="Epsilon%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Epsilon Boötis</a>, also known as "Izar" or "Pulcherrima", is a close triple star popular with amateur astronomers and the most prominent binary star in Boötes. The primary is a yellow- or orange-hued magnitude 2.5 giant star, the secondary is a magnitude 4.6 blue-hued <a href="main-sequence%20star">main-sequence star</a>, and the tertiary is a magnitude 12.0 star. The system is 210 light-years away. The name "Izar" comes from the Arabic word for "girdle" or "loincloth", referring to its location in the constellation. The name "Pulcherrima" comes from the Latin phrase for "most beautiful", referring to its contrasting colors in a telescope. The primary and secondary stars are separated by 2.9 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s at an angle of 341 degrees; the primary's spectral class is K0 and it has a luminosity of . To the naked eye, Izar has a magnitude of 2.37. 

Nearby <a href="Rho%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Rho</a> and <a href="Sigma%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Sigma Boötis</a> denote the herdsman's waist. Rho is an orange giant of spectral type K3III located around 160 light-years from Earth. It is ever so slightly variable, wavering by 0.003 of a magnitude from its average of 3.57. Sigma, a <a href="F-type%20main%20sequence%20star">yellow-white main sequence star</a> of spectral type F3V, is suspected of varying in brightness from 4.45 to 4.49. It is around 52 light-years distant.

Traditionally known as "Aulād al Dhiʼbah" (أولاد الضباع - "aulād al dhiʼb"), "the Whelps of the Hyenas", <a href="Theta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Theta</a>, <a href="Iota%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Iota</a>, <a href="Kappa%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Kappa</a> and <a href="Lambda%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Lambda Boötis</a> are a small group of stars in the far north of the constellation. The magnitude 4.05 <a href="Theta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Theta Boötis</a> has a spectral type of F7 and an absolute magnitude of 3.8. <a href="Iota%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Iota Boötis</a> is a triple star with a primary of magnitude 4.8 and spectral class of A7, a secondary of magnitude 7.5, and a tertiary of magnitude 12.6. The primary is 97 light-years away. The primary and secondary stars are separated by 38.5 arcseconds, at an angle of 33 degrees. The primary and tertiary stars are separated by 86.7 arcseconds at an angle of 194 degrees. Both the primary and tertiary appear white in a telescope, but the secondary appears yellow-hued. 

<a href="Kappa%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Kappa Boötis</a> is another wide double star. The primary is 155 light-years away and has a magnitude of 4.5. The secondary is 196 light-years away and has a magnitude of 6.6. The two components are separated by 13.4 arcseconds, at an angle of 236 degrees. The primary, with spectral class A7, appears white and the secondary appears bluish. 

An apparent magnitude 4.18 <a href="Ap%20and%20Bp%20stars">type A0p star</a>, <a href="Lambda%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Lambda Boötis</a> is the prototype of a class of chemically peculiar stars, only some of which pulsate as <a href="Delta%20Scuti">Delta Scuti</a>-type stars. The distinction between the Lambda Boötis stars as a class of stars with peculiar spectra, and the delta Scuti stars whose class describes pulsation in low-overtone pressure modes, is an important one. While many Lambda Boötis stars pulsate and are delta Scuti stars, not many delta Scuti stars have Lambda Boötis peculiarities, since the Lambda Boötis stars are a much rarer class whose members can be found both inside and outside the delta Scuti instability strip. Lambda Boötis stars are <a href="dwarf%20star">dwarf star</a>s that can be either spectral class A or F. Like BL Boötis-type stars they are metal-poor. Scientists have had difficulty explaining the characteristics of Lambda Boötis stars, partly because only around 60 confirmed members exist, but also due to heterogeneity in the literature. Lambda has an absolute magnitude of 1.8.

There are two dimmer <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Class%20F">F-type stars</a>, magnitude 4.83 <a href="12%20Bo%C3%B6tis">12 Boötis</a>, class F8; and magnitude 4.93 <a href="45%20Bo%C3%B6tis">45 Boötis</a>, class F5. <a href="Xi%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Xi Boötis</a> is a G8 yellow dwarf of magnitude 4.55, and absolute magnitude is 5.5. Two dimmer G-type stars are magnitude 4.86 <a href="31%20Bo%C3%B6tis">31 Boötis</a>, class G8, and magnitude 4.76 <a href="44%20Bo%C3%B6tis">44 Boötis</a>, class G0.

Of apparent magnitude 4.06, <a href="Upsilon%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Upsilon Boötis</a> has a spectral class of K5 and an absolute magnitude of −0.3. Dimmer than Upsilon Boötis is magnitude 4.54 <a href="Phi%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Phi Boötis</a>, with a spectral class of K2 and an absolute magnitude of −0.1. Just slightly dimmer than Phi at magnitude 4.60 is <a href="O%20Bo%C3%B6tis">O Boötis</a>, which, like Izar, has a spectral class of K0. O Boötis has an absolute magnitude of 0.2. The other four dim stars are magnitude 4.91 <a href="6%20Bo%C3%B6tis">6 Boötis</a>, class K4; magnitude 4.86 <a href="20%20Bo%C3%B6tis">20 Boötis</a>, class K3; magnitude 4.81 <a href="Omega%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Omega Boötis</a>, class K4; and magnitude 4.83 <a href="A%20Bo%C3%B6tis">A Boötis</a>, class K1.

There is one bright B-class star in Boötes; magnitude 4.93 <a href="Pi1%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Pi Boötis</a>, also called Alazal. It has a spectral class of B9 and is 40 parsecs from Earth. There is also one M-type star, magnitude 4.81 <a href="34%20Bo%C3%B6tis">34 Boötis</a>. It is of class gM0.

Besides Pulcherrima and Alkalurops, there are several other binary stars in Boötes:

<a href="44%20Bo%C3%B6tis">44 Boötis</a> (i Boötis) is a double variable star 42 light-years away. It has an overall magnitude of 4.8 and appears yellow to the naked eye. The primary is of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.1; their orbital period is 220 years. The secondary is itself an eclipsing variable star with a range of 0.6 magnitudes; its orbital period is 6.4 hours. It is a <a href="W%20Ursae%20Majoris%20variable">W Ursae Majoris variable</a> that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 7.1 to a maximum of 6.5 every 0.27 days. Both stars are G-type stars. Another eclipsing binary star is <a href="ZZ%20Bo%C3%B6tis">ZZ Boötis</a>, which has two F2-type components of almost equal mass, and ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 6.79 to a maximum of 7.44 over a period of 5.0 days.

Two of the brighter Mira-type variable stars in the constellation are <a href="R%20Bo%C3%B6tis">R</a> and <a href="S%20Bo%C3%B6tis">S Boötis</a>. Both are red giants that range greatly in magnitude—from 6.2 to 13.1 over 223.4 days, and 7.8 to 13.8 over a period of 270.7 days respectively. Also red giants, <a href="V%20Bo%C3%B6tis">V</a> and <a href="W%20Bo%C3%B6tis">W Boötis</a> are <a href="semi-regular%20variable%20star">semi-regular variable star</a>s that range in magnitude from 7.0 to 12.0 over a period of 258 days, and magnitude 4.7 to 5.4 over 450 days, respectively.

<a href="BL%20Bo%C3%B6tis">BL Boötis</a> is the prototype of its class of pulsating variable stars, the <a href="anomalous%20Cepheids">anomalous Cepheids</a>. These stars are somewhat similar to <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a>s, but they do not have the same relationship between their period and luminosity. Their periods are similar to <a href="RRAB%20variable">RRAB variable</a>s; however, they are far brighter than these stars. BL Boötis is a member of the cluster <a href="NGC%205466">NGC 5466</a>. Anomalous Cepheids are <a href="metallicity">metal poor</a> and have masses not much larger than the Sun's, on average, . BL Boötis type stars are a subtype of <a href="RR%20Lyrae">RR Lyrae</a> variables.

<a href="T%20Bo%C3%B6tis">T Boötis</a> was a <a href="nova">nova</a> observed in April 1860 at a magnitude of 9.7. It has never been observed since, but that does not preclude the possibility of it being a highly irregular <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a> or a <a href="recurrent%20nova">recurrent nova</a>.

<a href="Extrasolar%20planet">Extrasolar planet</a>s have been discovered encircling ten stars in Boötes as of 2012. <a href="Tau%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Tau Boötis</a> is orbited by a large planet, discovered in 1999. The host star itself is a magnitude 4.5 star of type F7V, 15.6 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s from Earth. It has a mass of and a radius of 1.331 <a href="solar%20radius">solar radii</a> (); a companion, <a href="GJ527B">GJ527B</a>, orbits at a distance of 240 AU. <a href="Tau%20Bo%C3%B6tis%20b">Tau Boötis b</a>, the sole planet discovered in the system, orbits at a distance of 0.046 AU every 3.31 days.

This makes it a <a href="hot%20Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a>. The host star and planet are <a href="tidal%20lock">tidally locked</a>, meaning that the planet's orbit and the star's particularly high rotation are synchronized. 

Furthermore, a slight variability in the host star's light may be caused by magnetic interactions with the planet. <a href="Carbon%20monoxide">Carbon monoxide</a> is present in the planet's atmosphere. Tau Boötis b does not <a href="astronomical%20transit">transit</a> its star, rather, its orbit is inclined 46 degrees. Like Tau Boötis b, <a href="HAT-P-4%20b">HAT-P-4 b</a> is also a hot Jupiter. It is noted for orbiting a particularly <a href="metallicity">metal-rich</a> host star and being of low density. Discovered in 2007, HAT-P-4 b has a mass of and a radius of .

Boötes is in a part of the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a> facing away from the plane of our home <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy, and so does not have open clusters or nebulae. Instead, it has one bright <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> and many faint <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a>. The globular cluster <a href="NGC%205466">NGC 5466</a> has an overall magnitude of 9.1 and a diameter of 11 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc%23Symbols%20and%20abbreviations">arcminutes</a>. It is a very loose globular cluster with fairly few stars and may appear as a rich, concentrated <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in a telescope. NGC 5466 is classified as a <a href="Shapley-Sawyer%20Concentration%20Class">Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class</a> 12 cluster, reflecting its sparsity. Its fairly large diameter means that it has a low <a href="surface%20brightness">surface brightness</a>, so it appears far dimmer than the catalogued magnitude of 9.1 and requires a large amateur telescope to view. Only approximately 12 stars are resolved by an amateur instrument.

Boötes has two bright galaxies. <a href="NGC%205248">NGC 5248</a> (<a href="Caldwell%20catalog">Caldwell</a> 45) is a <a href="Hubble%20sequence">type Sc galaxy</a> (a variety of <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a>) of magnitude 10.2. It measures 6.5 by 4.9 arcminutes. Fifty million light-years from Earth, NGC 5248 is a member of the <a href="Virgo%20Cluster">Virgo Cluster</a> of galaxies; it has dim outer arms and obvious <a href="H%20II%20region">H II region</a>s, <a href="dust%20lane">dust lane</a>s, and young <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a>s. <a href="NGC%205676">NGC 5676</a> is another type Sc galaxy of magnitude 10.9. It measures 3.9 by 2.0 arcminutes. Other galaxies include <a href="NGC%205008">NGC 5008</a>, a type Sc <a href="emission-line%20galaxy">emission-line galaxy</a>, <a href="NGC%205548">NGC 5548</a>, a type S <a href="Seyfert%20galaxy">Seyfert galaxy</a>, <a href="NGC%205653">NGC 5653</a>, a type S HII galaxy, <a href="NGC%205778">NGC 5778</a> (also classified as NGC 5825), a type E galaxy that is the brightest of its cluster, <a href="NGC%205886">NGC 5886</a>, and <a href="NGC%205888">NGC 5888</a>, a type SBb galaxy. <a href="NGC%205698">NGC 5698</a> is a barred spiral galaxy, notable for being the host of the 2005 supernova <a href="SN%202005bc">SN 2005bc</a>, which peaked at magnitude 15.3.

Further away lies the 250-million-light-year-diameter <a href="Bo%C3%B6tes%20void">Boötes void</a>, a huge space largely empty of galaxies. Discovered by <a href="Robert%20Kirshner">Robert Kirshner</a> and colleagues in 1981, it is roughly 700 million light-years from Earth. Beyond it and within the bounds of the constellation, lie two <a href="supercluster">supercluster</a>s at around 830 million and 1 billion light-years distant.

The <a href="Hercules%E2%80%93Corona%20Borealis%20Great%20Wall">Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall</a>, the largest known structure in the Universe, covers a significant part of Boötes.

Boötes is home to the <a href="Quadrantid">Quadrantid</a> meteor shower, the most prolific annual meteor shower. It was discovered in January 1835 and named in 1864 by Alexander Hershell. The <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> is located in northern Boötes near Kappa Boötis, in its namesake former constellation of <a href="Quadrans%20Muralis">Quadrans Muralis</a>. Quadrantid meteors are dim, but have a peak visible hourly rate of approximately 100 per hour on January 3–4. The <a href="zenithal%20hourly%20rate">zenithal hourly rate</a> of the Quadrantids is approximately 130 meteors per hour at their peak; it is also a very narrow shower. 

The Quadrantids are notoriously difficult to observe because of a low radiant and often inclement weather. The parent body of the meteor shower has been disputed for decades; however, <a href="Peter%20Jenniskens">Peter Jenniskens</a> has proposed <a href="2003%20EH1">2003 EH</a>, a minor planet, as the parent. 2003 EH may be linked to <a href="C/1490%20Y1">C/1490 Y</a>, a comet previously thought to be a potential parent body for the Quadrantids. 

2003 EH is a <a href="short-period%20comet">short-period comet</a> of the <a href="Jupiter%20family%20comet">Jupiter family</a>; 500 years ago, it experienced a catastrophic breakup event. It is now dormant. The Quadrantids had notable displays in 1982, 1985, and 2004. Meteors from this shower often appear to have a blue hue and travel at a moderate speed of 41.5–43 kilometers per second.

On April 28, 1984, a remarkable outburst of the normally placid <a href="Alpha%20Bootids">Alpha Bootids</a> was observed by visual observer Frank Witte from 00:00 to 2:30 UTC. In a 6 cm telescope, he observed 433 meteors in a field of view near <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> with a diameter of less than 1°. <a href="Peter%20Jenniskens">Peter Jenniskens</a> comments that this outburst resembled a "typical dust trail crossing". The Alpha Bootids normally begin on April 14, peaking on April 27 and 28, and finishing on May 12. Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 20.9 kilometers per second. They may be related to Comet <a href="73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann%203">73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3</a>, but this connection is only theorized.

The <a href="June%20Bootids">June Bootids</a>, also known as the Iota Draconids, is a meteor shower associated with the comet <a href="7P/Pons-Winnecke">7P/Pons-Winnecke</a>, first recognized on May 27, 1916, by William F. Denning. The shower, with its slow meteors, was not observed prior to 1916 because Earth did not cross the comet's dust trail until Jupiter perturbed Pons-Winnecke's orbit, causing it to come within 0.03 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s of Earth's orbit the first year the June Bootids were observed. 

In 1982, E. A. Reznikov discovered that the 1916 outburst was caused by material released from the comet in 1819. Another outburst of the June Bootids was not observed until 1998, because Comet Pons-Winnecke's orbit was not in a favorable position. However, on June 27, 1998, an outburst of meteors radiating from Boötes, later confirmed to be associated with Pons-Winnecke, was observed. They were incredibly long-lived, with trails of the brightest meteors lasting several seconds at times. Many <a href="Meteoroid%23Fireball">fireball</a>s, green-hued trails, and even some meteors that cast shadows were observed throughout the outburst, which had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 200–300 meteors per hour. 

Two Russian astronomers determined in 2002 that material ejected from the comet in 1825 was responsible for the 1998 outburst. <a href="Ejecta">Ejecta</a> from the comet dating to 1819, 1825, and 1830 was predicted to enter Earth's atmosphere on June 23, 2004. The predictions of a shower less spectacular than the 1998 showing were borne out in a display that had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 16–20 meteors per hour that night. The June Bootids are not expected to have another outburst in the next 50 years. 

Typically, only 1–2 dim, very slow meteors are visible per hour; the average June Bootid has a magnitude of 5.0. It is related to the <a href="Alpha%20Draconids">Alpha Draconids</a> and the <a href="Bootids-Draconids">Bootids-Draconids</a>. The shower lasts from June 27 to July 5, with a peak on the night of June 28. The June Bootids are classified as a class III shower (variable), and has an average entry velocity of 18 kilometers per second. Its radiant is located 7 degrees north of Beta Boötis.

The <a href="Beta%20Bootids">Beta Bootids</a> is a weak shower that begins on January 5, peaks on January 16, and ends on January 18. Its meteors travel at 43 kilometers/second. The <a href="January%20Bootids">January Bootids</a> is a short, young meteor shower that begins on January 9, peaks from January 16 to January 18, and ends on January 18. 

The <a href="Phi%20Bootids">Phi Bootids</a> is another weak shower radiating from Boötes. It begins on April 16, peaks on April 30 and May 1, and ends on May 12. Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 15.1 km/s. They were discovered in 2006. The shower's peak hourly rate can be as high as 6 meteors per hour. Though named for a star in Boötes, the Phi Bootid radiant has moved into <a href="Hercules%20%28constellation%29">Hercules</a>. The meteor stream is associated with three different asteroids: <a href="1620%20Geographos">1620 Geographos</a>, <a href="2062%20Aten">2062 Aten</a>, and <a href="1978%20CA">1978 CA</a>. 

The <a href="Lambda%20Bootids">Lambda Bootids</a>, part of the <a href="Bootid-Coronae%20Borealid%20Complex">Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex</a>, are a weak annual shower with moderately fast meteors; 41.75 km/s. The complex includes the Lambda Bootids, as well as the <a href="Theta%20Coronae%20Borealids">Theta Coronae Borealids</a> and <a href="Xi%20Coronae%20Borealids">Xi Coronae Borealids</a>. All of the Bootid-Coronae Borealid showers are <a href="Jupiter%20family%20comet">Jupiter family comet</a> showers; the streams in the complex have highly inclined orbits.

There are several minor showers in Boötes, some of whose existence is yet to be verified. The <a href="Rho%20Bootids">Rho Bootids</a> radiate from near the namesake star, and were hypothesized in 2010. The average Rho Bootid has an entry velocity of 43 km/s. It peaks in November and lasts for 3 days. 

The Rho Bootid shower is part of the <a href="SMA%20complex">SMA complex</a>, a group of meteor showers related to the <a href="Taurids">Taurids</a>, which is in turn linked to the comet <a href="2P/Encke">2P/Encke</a>. However, the link to the Taurid shower remains unconfirmed and may be a chance correlation. Another such shower is the <a href="Gamma%20Bootids">Gamma Bootids</a>, which were hypothesized in 2006. Gamma Bootids have an entry velocity of 50.3 km/s. The <a href="Nu%20Bootids">Nu Bootids</a>, hypothesized in 2012, have faster meteors, with an entry velocity of 62.8 km/s.

Bernardino Ochino (1487–1564) was an <a href="Italy">Italian</a>, who was raised a <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a> and later turned to <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>.

Bernardino Ochino was born in <a href="Siena">Siena</a>, the son of the barber Domenico Ochino, and at the age of 7 or 8, in around 1504, was entrusted to the order of <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> Friars. From 1510 he studied medicine at <a href="Perugia">Perugia</a>.

At the age of 38, Ochino transferred himself in 1534 to the newly founded <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin">Order of Friars Minor Capuchin</a>. By then he was the close friend of <a href="Juan%20de%20Vald%C3%A9s">Juan de Valdés</a>, <a href="Pietro%20Bembo">Pietro Bembo</a>, <a href="Vittoria%20Colonna">Vittoria Colonna</a>, <a href="Pietro%20Martire%20Vermigli">Pietro Martire</a>, <a href="Pietro%20Carnesecchi">Carnesecchi</a>. In 1538 he was elected vicar-general of his order. In 1539, urged by Bembo, he visited <a href="Venice">Venice</a> and delivered a course of <a href="sermon">sermon</a>s showing a sympathy with <a href="justification%20by%20faith">justification by faith</a>, which appeared more clearly in his "Dialogues" published the same year. He was suspected and denounced, but nothing ensued until the establishment of the <a href="Inquisition">Inquisition</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in June 1542, at the instigation of Cardinal <a href="Pope%20Paul%20IV">Giovanni Pietro Carafa</a>. Ochino received a citation to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, and set out to obey it about the middle of August. According to his own statement, he was deterred from presenting himself at Rome by the warnings of <a href="Gasparo%20Contarini">Cardinal Contarini</a>, whom he found at <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, dying of <a href="poison">poison</a> administered by the reactionary party.

Ochino turned aside to <a href="Florence%2C%20Italy">Florence</a>, and after some hesitation went across the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>. He was cordially received by <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, and published within two years several volumes of "Prediche", controversial tracts rationalizing his change of <a href="religion">religion</a>. He also addressed replies to marchioness <a href="Vittoria%20Colonna">Vittoria Colonna</a>, <a href="Claudio%20Tolomei">Claudio Tolomei</a>, and other Italian sympathizers who were reluctant to go to the same length as himself. His own breach with the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> was final.

In 1545 Ochino became minister of the Italian Protestant congregation at <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>. From this time dates his contact with <a href="Caspar%20Schwenckfeld">Caspar Schwenckfeld</a>. He was compelled to flee when, in January 1547, the city was occupied by the imperial forces for the <a href="Diet%20of%20Augsburg">Diet of Augsburg</a>.

Ochino found asylum in <a href="England">England</a>, where he was made a <a href="prebendary">prebendary</a> of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>, received a <a href="pension">pension</a> from <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI's</a> privy purse, and composed his major work, the "Tragoedie or Dialoge of the unjuste usurped primacie of the Bishop of Rome". This text, originally written in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, is extant only in the 1549 translation of Bishop <a href="John%20Ponet">John Ponet</a>. The form is a series of dialogues. <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, enraged at the spread of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>'s kingdom, convokes the fiends in council, and resolves to set up the <a href="pope">pope</a> as <a href="antichrist">antichrist</a>. The state, represented by the emperor <a href="Phocas">Phocas</a>, is persuaded to connive at the pope's assumption of spiritual authority; the other churches are intimidated into acquiescence; Lucifer's projects seem fully accomplished, when <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a> raises up <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII of England</a> and his son for their overthrow.

Several of Ochino's "Prediche" were translated into English by <a href="Anne%20Bacon">Anna Cooke</a>; and he published numerous controversial treatises on the Continent.

In 1553 the accession of <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I</a> drove Ochino from England. He went to Basel, where <a href="Lelio%20Sozzini">Lelio Sozzini</a> and the lawyer <a href="Martino%20Muralto">Martino Muralto</a> were sent to secure Ochino as pastor of the Italian church at <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, which Ochino accepted. The Italian congregation there was composed mainly of refugees from <a href="Locarno">Locarno</a>. There for 10 years Ochino wrote books which gave increasing evidence of his alienation from the <a href="orthodoxy">orthodoxy</a> around him. The most important of these was the "Labyrinth", a discussion of the <a href="free%20will">freedom of the will</a>, covertly undermining the <a href="Calvinism">Calvinistic</a> doctrine of <a href="predestination">predestination</a>.

In 1563 a long simmering storm burst on Ochino with the publication of his "Thirty Dialogues", in one of which his adversaries maintained that he had justified <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a> under the disguise of a pretended refutation. His dialogues on <a href="divorce">divorce</a> and against the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> were also considered heretical.

Ochino was not given opportunity to defend himself, and was banished from Zürich. After being refused admission by other Protestant cities, he directed his steps towards <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, at that time the most tolerant state in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. He had not resided there long when an edict appeared (August 8, 1564) banishing all foreign <a href="dissident">dissident</a>s. Fleeing the country, he encountered the <a href="Black%20Death">plague</a> at <a href="Pi%C5%84cz%C3%B3w">Pińczów</a>; three of his four children were carried off; and he himself, worn out by misfortune, died in solitude and obscurity at <a href="Slavkov%20u%20Brna">Slavkov</a> in <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>, about the end of 1564.

Ochino's reputation among Protestants was low. He was charged by <a href="Thomas%20Browne">Thomas Browne</a> in 1643 with the authorship of the legendary-apocryphal heretical treatise "<a href="The%20Treatise%20of%20the%20Three%20Impostors">De tribus Impostoribus</a>", as well as with having carried his alleged approval of polygamy into practice.

His biographer <a href="Karl%20Benrath">Karl Benrath</a> justified him, representing him as a fervent <a href="Evangelism">evangelist</a> and at the same time as a speculative thinker with a passion for free inquiry. The picture is of Ochino always learning and unlearning and arguing out difficult questions with himself in his dialogues, frequently without attaining to any absolute conviction.

The <a href="Cayuga%20language">Cayuga</a> name is "Tayęda:ne:gęˀ or Detgayę:da:negęˀ", "land of two logs."

The Bay, as it is known locally, provides some of the best trophy <a href="Walleye">Walleye</a> angling in North America as well as most sport fish common to the great lakes. The bay is subject to <a href="algae%20bloom">algae bloom</a>s in late summer which are a naturally occurring phenomenon and do not indicate pollution other than from agricultural runoff. <a href="Zebra%20mussel">Zebra mussel</a>s as well as the other invasive species found in the great lakes are present.

The Quinte area played a vital role in bootlegging during <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition in the United States</a>, with large volumes of booze being produced in the area, and shipped via boat on the Bay to <a href="Lake%20Ontario">Lake Ontario</a> finally arriving in New York State where it was distributed. Illegal sales of liquor accounted for many fortunes in and around <a href="Belleville%2C%20Ontario">Belleville</a>.

Tourism in the area is significant, especially in the summer months due to the Bay of Quinte and its fishing, local golf courses, provincial parks, and wineries.

The northern side of the bay is defined by Ontario's mainland, while the southern side follows the shore of the Prince Edward County headland. Beginning in the east with the outlet to Lake Ontario, the bay runs west-southwest for 25 kilometres to <a href="Picton%2C%20Ontario">Picton</a> (although this section is also called Adolphus Reach), where it turns north-northwest for another 20 kilometres as far as <a href="Deseronto%2C%20Ontario">Deseronto</a>. From there it turns south-southwest again for another 40 kilometres, running past <a href="Big%20Island%20%28Bay%20of%20Quinte%29">Big Island</a> on the south and <a href="Belleville%2C%20Ontario">Belleville</a> on the north. The width of the bay rarely exceeds two kilometres. The bay ends at <a href="Trenton%2C%20Ontario">Trenton</a> (<a href="Quinte%20West%2C%20Ontario">Quinte West</a>) and the <a href="Trent%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Trent River</a>, both also on the north side. The <a href="Murray%20Canal">Murray Canal</a> has been cut through the "Carrying Place", the few miles separating the end of the bay and Lake Ontario on the west side. The Trent River is part of the <a href="Trent-Severn%20Waterway">Trent-Severn Waterway</a>, a canal connecting Lake Ontario to <a href="Lake%20Simcoe">Lake Simcoe</a> and then <a href="Georgian%20Bay">Georgian Bay</a> on <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a>.

There are several sub-bays off the Bay of Quinte, including Hay Bay, Big Bay, and Muscote Bay.

Quinte is also a region comprising several communities situated along the Bay of Quinte, including <a href="Belleville%2C%20Ontario">Belleville</a> which is the largest city in the Quinte Region, and represents a midpoint between <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, and <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>.

Bassoon

The bassoon is a <a href="woodwind%20instrument">woodwind instrument</a> in the <a href="double%20reed">double reed</a> family that typically plays music written in the <a href="Bass%20clef">bass</a> and <a href="tenor%20clef">tenor clef</a>s, and occasionally the <a href="treble%20clef">treble</a>. Appearing in its modern form in the 19th century, the bassoon figures prominently in <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>l, <a href="concert%20band">concert band</a>, and <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a> literature. The bassoon is a non-<a href="transposing%20instrument">transposing instrument</a> known for its distinctive tone colour, wide range, variety of character and agility. Listeners often compare its warm, dark, reedy <a href="timbre">timbre</a> to that of a male <a href="baritone">baritone</a> voice. Someone who plays the bassoon is called a bassoonist.

The word bassoon comes from French "basson" and from Italian "bassone" ("basso" with the augmentative suffix "-one"). However, the Italian name for the same instrument is "fagotto" and in Spanish it is fagot. Fagot is a germanic word which means bundle of sticks. 

The range of the bassoon begins at B (the first one below the <a href="bass%20staff">bass staff</a>) and extends upward over three <a href="octave">octave</a>s, roughly to the G above the treble staff (G). Higher notes are possible but difficult to produce, and rarely called for: orchestral and concert band parts rarely go higher than C or D. Even <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>'s famously difficult opening solo in "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>" only ascends to D.

A is possible with a special extension to the instrument—see "<a href="%23Extended%20techniques">Extended techniques</a>" below.

The bassoon disassembles into six main pieces, including the <a href="Reed%20%28instrument%29">reed</a>. The bell (6), extending upward; the bass joint (or long joint) (5), connecting the bell and the boot; the boot (or butt) (4), at the bottom of the instrument and folding over on itself; the wing joint (or tenor joint) (3), which extends from boot to bocal; and the <a href="bocal">bocal</a> (or crook) (2), a crooked metal tube that attaches the wing joint to a reed (1) (). Bassoons are double reed instruments like the <a href="oboe">oboe</a> and the <a href="Cor%20anglais">English horn</a>.

A modern beginner's bassoon is generally made of <a href="maple">maple</a>, with medium-hardness types such as <a href="Acer%20pseudoplatanus">sycamore maple</a> and <a href="Acer%20saccharum">sugar maple</a> preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of materials such as <a href="polypropylene">polypropylene</a> and <a href="ebonite">ebonite</a>, primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons were made in the past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The <a href="Bore%20%28wind%20instruments%29">bore</a> of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a>, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected at the bottom of the instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and <a href="tone%20hole">tone hole</a>s are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also <a href="stain">stain</a>ed and <a href="varnish">varnish</a>ed. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or <a href="ivory">ivory</a>. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.

Folded upon itself, the bassoon stands tall, but the total sounding length is . Playing is facilitated by doubling the tube back on itself and by closing the distance between the widely spaced holes with a complex system of key work, which extends throughout nearly the entire length of the instrument. There are also short-reach bassoons made for the benefit of young or petite players.

Music historians generally consider the <a href="dulcian">dulcian</a> to be the forerunner of the modern bassoon, as the two instruments share many characteristics: a double reed fitted to a metal crook, obliquely drilled tone holes and a conical bore that doubles back on itself. The origins of the dulcian are obscure, but by the mid-16th century it was available in as many as eight different sizes, from <a href="soprano">soprano</a> to great bass. A full consort of dulcians was a rarity; its primary function seems to have been to provide the bass in the typical wind band of the time, either loud (<a href="shawm">shawm</a>s) or soft (<a href="Recorder%20%28musical%20instrument%29">recorder</a>s), indicating a remarkable ability to vary <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a> to suit the need. Otherwise, dulcian technique was rather primitive, with eight finger holes and two keys, indicating that it could play in only a limited number of key signatures.

The dulcian came to be known as "<a href="%3Awiktionary%3Afagotto">fagotto</a>" in Italy. However, the usual etymology that equates "fagotto" with "<a href="%3Awiktionary%3Afaggot">bundle of sticks</a>" is somewhat misleading, as the latter term did not come into general use until later. Some think it may resemble the Roman <a href="Fasces">Fasces</a>, a standard of bound sticks with an ax. A further discrepancy lies in the fact that the dulcian was carved out of a single block of wood—in other words, a single "stick" and not a bundle.

Circumstantial evidence indicates that the <a href="baroque">baroque</a> bassoon was a newly invented instrument, rather than a simple modification of the old dulcian. The dulcian was not immediately supplanted, but continued to be used well into the 18th century by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> and others. The man most likely responsible for developing the true bassoon was Martin Hotteterre (d.1712), who may also have invented the three-piece "flûte traversière" and the "hautbois" (baroque oboe). Some historians believe that sometime in the 1650s, Hotteterre conceived the bassoon in four sections (bell, bass joint, boot and wing joint), an arrangement that allowed greater accuracy in machining the bore compared to the one-piece dulcian. He also extended the compass down to <a href="B%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">B</a> by adding two <a href="Key%20%28instrument%29">keys</a>. An alternate view maintains Hotteterre was one of several craftsmen responsible for the development of the early bassoon. These may have included additional members of the Hotteterre family, as well as other French makers active around the same time. No original French bassoon from this period survives, but if it did, it would most likely resemble the earliest extant bassoons of <a href="Johann%20Christoph%20Denner">Johann Christoph Denner</a> and Richard Haka from the 1680s. Sometime around 1700, a fourth key (<a href="G%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">G♯</a>) was added, and it was for this type of instrument that composers such as <a href="Antonio%20Vivaldi">Antonio Vivaldi</a>, Bach, and <a href="Georg%20Philipp%20Telemann">Georg Philipp Telemann</a> wrote their demanding music. A fifth key, for the low <a href="E%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">E</a>, was added during the first half of the 18th century. Notable makers of the 4-key and 5-key baroque bassoon include J.H. Eichentopf (c. 1678–1769), J. Poerschmann (1680–1757), <a href="Thomas%20Stanesby">Thomas Stanesby, Jr</a>. (1668–1734), G.H. Scherer (1703–1778), and Prudent Thieriot (1732–1786).

Increasing demands on capabilities of instruments and players in the 19th century—particularly larger concert halls requiring greater volume and the rise of virtuoso composer-performers—spurred further refinement. Increased sophistication, both in manufacturing techniques and acoustical knowledge, made possible great improvements in the instrument's playability.

The modern bassoon exists in two distinct primary forms, the Buffet system and the Heckel system. Most of the world plays the Heckel system, while the Buffet system is primarily played in France, Belgium, and parts of <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. A number of other types of bassoons have been constructed by various instrument makers, such as the rare <a href="Galandronome">Galandronome</a>.

The design of the modern bassoon owes a great deal to the performer, teacher, and composer <a href="Carl%20Almenr%C3%A4der">Carl Almenräder</a>. Assisted by the German acoustic researcher <a href="Gottfried%20Weber">Gottfried Weber</a>, he developed the 17-key bassoon with a range spanning four octaves. Almenräder's improvements to the bassoon began with an 1823 treatise describing ways of improving <a href="Intonation%20%28music%29">intonation</a>, response, and technical ease of playing by augmenting and rearranging the keywork. Subsequent articles further developed his ideas. His employment at <a href="Schott%20Music">Schott</a> gave him the freedom to construct and test instruments according to these new designs, and he published the results in "Caecilia", Schott's house journal. Almenräder continued publishing and building instruments until his death in 1846, and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> himself requested one of the newly made instruments after hearing of the papers. In 1831, Almenräder left Schott to start his own factory with a partner, <a href="Johann%20Adam%20Heckel">Johann Adam Heckel</a>.

Heckel and two generations of descendants continued to refine the bassoon, and their instruments became the standard, with other makers following. Because of their superior singing tone quality (an improvement upon one of the main drawbacks of the Almenräder instruments), the Heckel instruments competed for prominence with the reformed Wiener system, a <a href="Boehm%20system">Boehm</a>-style bassoon, and a completely keyed instrument devised by <a href="Charles-Joseph%20Sax">Charles-Joseph Sax</a>, father of <a href="Adolphe%20Sax">Adolphe Sax</a>. F.W. Kruspe implemented a latecomer attempt in 1893 to reform the <a href="Fingering%20%28music%29">fingering</a> system, but it failed to catch on. Other attempts to improve the instrument included a 24-keyed model and a single-reed <a href="Mouthpiece%20%28woodwind%29">mouthpiece</a>, but both these had adverse effects on tone and were abandoned.

Coming into the 20th century, the Heckel-style German model of bassoon dominated the field. Heckel himself had made over 1,100 instruments by the turn of the 20th century (serial numbers begin at 3,000), and the British makers' instruments were no longer desirable for the changing <a href="Pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a> requirements of the symphony orchestra, remaining primarily in <a href="military%20band">military band</a> use.
Except for a brief 1940s wartime conversion to <a href="ball%20bearing">ball bearing</a> manufacture, the Heckel concern has produced instruments continuously to the present day. Heckel bassoons are considered by many to be the best, although a range of Heckel-style instruments is available from several other manufacturers, all with slightly different playing characteristics.

Because its mechanism is primitive compared to most modern woodwinds, makers have occasionally attempted to "reinvent" the bassoon. In the 1960s, <a href="Giles%20Brindley">Giles Brindley</a> began to develop what he called the "logical bassoon," which aimed to improve intonation and evenness of tone through use of an electrically activated mechanism, making possible key combinations too complex for the human hand to manage. Brindley's logical bassoon was never marketed.

The Buffet system bassoon achieved its basic acoustical properties somewhat earlier than the Heckel. Thereafter, it continued to develop in a more conservative manner. While the early history of the Heckel bassoon included a complete overhaul of the instrument in both <a href="acoustics">acoustics</a> and key work, the development of the Buffet system consisted primarily of incremental improvements to the key work. This minimalist approach of the Buffet deprived it of improved consistency of intonation, ease of operation, and increased power, which is found in Heckel bassoons, but the Buffet is considered by some to have a more vocal and expressive quality. The conductor <a href="John%20Foulds">John Foulds</a> lamented in 1934 the dominance of the Heckel-style bassoon, considering them too homogeneous in sound with the <a href="French%20horn">horn</a>. The modern Buffet system has 22 keys with its range being about the same as the Heckel.

Compared to the Heckel bassoon, Buffet system bassoons have a narrower bore and simpler mechanism, requiring different fingerings for many notes. Switching between Heckel and Buffet requires extensive retraining. Buffet instruments are known for a reedier sound and greater facility in the <a href="Register%20%28music%29">upper registers</a>, reaching e<nowiki>"</nowiki> and f<nowiki>"</nowiki> with far greater ease and less air resistance. French woodwind instruments' tone in general exhibits a certain amount of "edge," with more of a vocal quality than is usual elsewhere, and the Buffet bassoon is no exception. This type of sound can be beneficial in music by French composers, but has drawn criticism for being too intrusive. As with all bassoons, the tone varies considerably, depending on individual instrument and performer. In the hands of a lesser player, the Heckel bassoon can sound flat and woody, but good players succeed in producing a vibrant, singing tone. Conversely, a poorly played Buffet can sound buzzy and nasal, but good players succeed in producing a warm, expressive sound, different from—but not inferior to—the Heckel.

Though the United Kingdom once favored the French system, Buffet-system instruments are no longer made there and the last prominent British player of the French system retired in the 1980s. However, with continued use in some regions and its distinctive tone, the Buffet continues to have a place in modern bassoon playing, particularly in France, where it is originated. Buffet-model bassoons are currently made in Paris by <a href="Buffet%20Crampon">Buffet Crampon</a> and the atelier Ducasse (Romainville, France). The Selmer Company stopped fabrication of French system bassoons a few years ago. Some players, for example the late Gerald Corey in Canada, have learned to play both types and will alternate between them depending on the repertoire.

Orchestras first used the bassoon to reinforce the bass line, and as the bass of the double reed choir (oboes and taille). Baroque composer <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Jean-Baptiste Lully</a> and his "Les Petits Violons" included oboes and bassoons along with the strings in the 16-piece (later 21-piece) ensemble, as one of the first orchestras to include the newly invented double reeds. <a href="Antonio%20Cesti">Antonio Cesti</a> included a bassoon in his 1668 opera "<a href="Il%20pomo%20d%27oro">Il pomo d'oro</a>" (The Golden Apple). However, use of bassoons in concert orchestras was sporadic until the late 17th century when double reeds began to make their way into standard instrumentation. This was largely due to the spread of the "hautbois" to countries outside France. Increasing use of the bassoon as a "<a href="Figured%20bass%23Basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a>" instrument meant that it began to be included in <a href="opera">opera</a> orchestras, first in France and later in Italy, Germany and England. Meanwhile, composers such as <a href="Joseph%20Bodin%20de%20Boismortier">Joseph Bodin de Boismortier</a>, <a href="Michel%20Corrette">Michel Corrette</a>, <a href="Johann%20Ernst%20Galliard">Johann Ernst Galliard</a>, <a href="Jan%20Dismas%20Zelenka">Jan Dismas Zelenka</a>, <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Fasch">Johann Friedrich Fasch</a> and Telemann wrote demanding solo and ensemble music for the instrument. Antonio Vivaldi brought the bassoon to prominence by featuring it in 37 <a href="Concerto">concerti</a> for the instrument.

By the mid-18th century, the bassoon's function in the orchestra was still mostly limited to that of a continuo instrument—since scores often made no specific mention of the bassoon, its use was implied, particularly if there were parts for oboes or other winds. Beginning in the early <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> era, composers such as <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a>, <a href="Michael%20Haydn">Michael Haydn</a>, <a href="Johann%20Christian%20Bach">Johann Christian Bach</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Sammartini">Giovanni Battista Sammartini</a> and <a href="Johann%20Stamitz">Johann Stamitz</a> included parts that exploited the bassoon for its unique color, rather than for its perfunctory ability to double the bass line. Orchestral works with fully independent parts for the bassoon would not become commonplace until the <a href="Classical%20period%20%28music%29">Classical</a> era. <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>'s "<a href="Symphony%20No.%2041%20%28Mozart%29">Jupiter</a>" symphony is a prime example, with its famous bassoon solos in the first <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movement</a>. The bassoons were generally paired, as in current practice, though the famed <a href="Mannheim%20school">Mannheim orchestra</a> boasted four.

Another important use of the bassoon during the Classical era was in the "<a href="Harmonie">Harmonie</a>", a chamber ensemble consisting of pairs of oboes, horns and bassoons; later, two <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>s would be added to form an octet. The "Harmonie" was an ensemble maintained by German and Austrian noblemen for private music-making, and was a cost-effective alternative to a full orchestra. Haydn, Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and <a href="Franz%20Krommer">Franz Krommer</a> all wrote considerable amounts of music for the "Harmonie".

The modern symphony orchestra typically calls for two bassoons, often with a third playing the <a href="contrabassoon">contrabassoon</a>. Some works call for four or more players. The first player is frequently called upon to perform solo passages. The bassoon's distinctive tone suits it for both plaintive, lyrical solos such as <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>'s "<a href="Bol%C3%A9ro">Boléro</a>" and more comical ones, such as the grandfather's theme in "<a href="Peter%20and%20the%20Wolf">Peter and the Wolf</a>". Its agility suits it for passages such as the famous running line (doubled in the <a href="viola">viola</a>s and <a href="cello">cello</a>s) in the overture to "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>". In addition to its solo role, the bassoon is an effective bass to a woodwind choir, a bass line along with the cellos and <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a>es, and <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a> support along with the French horns.

A <a href="concert%20band">wind ensemble</a> will usually also include two bassoons and sometimes contrabassoon, each with independent parts; other types of concert wind ensembles will often have larger sections, with many players on each of first or second parts; in simpler arrangements there will be only one bassoon part and no contrabassoon. The bassoon's role in the concert band is similar to its role in the orchestra, though when scoring is thick it often cannot be heard above the brass instruments also in its range. "La Fiesta Mexicana", by <a href="H.%20Owen%20Reed">H. Owen Reed</a>, features the instrument prominently, as does the transcription of <a href="Malcolm%20Arnold">Malcolm Arnold</a>'s "<a href="Four%20Scottish%20Dances">Four Scottish Dances</a>", which has become a staple of the concert band repertoire.

The bassoon is part of the standard <a href="wind%20quintet">wind quintet</a> instrumentation, along with the flute, oboe, clarinet, and horn; it is also frequently combined in various ways with other woodwinds. <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s "Duet-Concertino" pairs it with the clarinet as "concertante" instruments, with string orchestra in support. An ensemble known as the "reed quintet" also makes use of the bassoon. A reed quintet is made up of an oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bass clarinet, and bassoon.

The <a href="bassoon%20quartet">bassoon quartet</a> has also gained favor in recent times. The bassoon's wide range and variety of tone colors make it well suited to grouping in a like-instrument ensemble. <a href="Peter%20Schickele">Peter Schickele</a>'s "Last Tango in Bayreuth" (after themes from "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>") is a popular work; Schickele's fictional alter ego <a href="P.%20D.%20Q.%20Bach">P. D. Q. Bach</a> exploits the more humorous aspects with his quartet "Lip My Reeds," which at one point calls for players to perform on the reed alone. It also calls for a low <a href="A%20%28musical%20note%29">A</a> at the very end of the prelude section in the fourth bassoon part. It is written so that the first bassoon does not play; instead, the player's role is to place an extension in the bell of the fourth bassoon so that the note can be played.

The bassoon is infrequently used as a <a href="jazz">jazz</a> instrument and rarely seen in a <a href="Jazz%20band">jazz ensemble</a>. It first began appearing in the 1920s, including specific calls for its use in <a href="Paul%20Whiteman">Paul Whiteman</a>'s group, the unusual <a href="Octet%20%28music%29">octets</a> of <a href="Alec%20Wilder">Alec Wilder</a>, and a few other session appearances. The next few decades saw the instrument used only sporadically, as symphonic jazz fell out of favor, but the 1960s saw artists such as <a href="Yusef%20Lateef">Yusef Lateef</a> and <a href="Chick%20Corea">Chick Corea</a> incorporate bassoon into their recordings. Lateef's diverse and eclectic instrumentation saw the bassoon as a natural addition (see, e.g., "<a href="The%20Centaur%20and%20the%20Phoenix">The Centaur and the Phoenix</a>" (1960) which features bassoon as part of a 6-man horn section, including a few solos) while Corea employed the bassoon in combination with <a href="flautist">flautist</a> <a href="Hubert%20Laws">Hubert Laws</a>.

More recently, <a href="Illinois%20Jacquet">Illinois Jacquet</a>, <a href="Ray%20Pizzi">Ray Pizzi</a>, <a href="Frank%20Tiberi">Frank Tiberi</a>, and <a href="Marshall%20Allen">Marshall Allen</a> have both doubled on bassoon in addition to their saxophone performances. Bassoonist <a href="Karen%20Borca">Karen Borca</a>, a performer of <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a>, is one of the few jazz musicians to play only bassoon; <a href="Michael%20Rabinowitz">Michael Rabinowitz</a>, the Spanish bassoonist <a href="Javier%20Abad">Javier Abad</a>, and <a href="James%20Lassen">James Lassen</a>, an American resident in <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, Norway, are others. <a href="Katherine%20Young%20%28musician%29">Katherine Young</a> plays the bassoon in the ensembles of <a href="Anthony%20Braxton">Anthony Braxton</a>. <a href="Lindsay%20Cooper">Lindsay Cooper</a>, <a href="Paul%20Hanson">Paul Hanson</a>, the Brazilian bassoonist <a href="Alexandre%20Silverio">Alexandre Silverio</a>, <a href="Trent%20Jacobs">Trent Jacobs</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Smith%20%28bassoonist%29">Daniel Smith</a> are also currently using the bassoon in jazz. French bassoonists <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Decreux">Jean-Jacques Decreux</a> and <a href="Alexandre%20Ouzounoff">Alexandre Ouzounoff</a> have both recorded jazz, exploiting the flexibility of the Buffet system instrument to good effect.

The bassoon is even rarer as a regular member of rock bands. However, several 1960s pop music hits feature the bassoon, including "<a href="The%20Tears%20of%20a%20Clown">The Tears of a Clown</a>" by <a href="The%20Miracles">Smokey Robinson and the Miracles</a> (the bassoonist was Charles R. Sirard), "<a href="Jennifer%20Juniper">Jennifer Juniper</a>" by <a href="Donovan">Donovan</a>, "<a href="The%20Turtles">The Turtles</a>" "<a href="Happy%20Together%20%28song%29">Happy Together</a>"(third verse,overdub), "<a href="The%2059th%20Street%20Bridge%20Song%20%28Feelin%27%20Groovy%29">59th Street Bridge Song</a>" by <a href="Harpers%20Bizarre">Harpers Bizarre</a>, and the oompah bassoon underlying <a href="The%20New%20Vaudeville%20Band">The New Vaudeville Band</a>'s "<a href="Winchester%20Cathedral%20%28song%29">Winchester Cathedral</a>". From 1974 to 1978, the bassoon was played by <a href="Lindsay%20Cooper">Lindsay Cooper</a> in the British <a href="Avant-garde%20music">avant-garde band</a> <a href="Henry%20Cow">Henry Cow</a>. In the 1970s it was played, in the British medieval/<a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> band <a href="Gryphon%20%28band%29">Gryphon</a>, by Brian Gulland, as well as by the American band <a href="Ambrosia%20%28band%29">Ambrosia</a>, where it was played by drummer Burleigh Drummond. The Belgian <a href="Rock%20in%20Opposition">Rock in Opposition</a>-band <a href="Univers%20Zero">Univers Zero</a> is also known for its use of the bassoon.

In the 1990s, <a href="Madonna%20Wayne%20Gacy">Madonna Wayne Gacy</a> provided bassoon for the alternative metal band <a href="Marilyn%20Manson%20%28band%29">Marilyn Manson</a> as did Aimee DeFoe, in what is self-described as "grouchily lilting garage bassoon" in the indie-rock band <a href="Blogurt">Blogurt</a> from <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, Pennsylvania. More recently, <a href="These%20New%20Puritans">These New Puritans</a>'s 2010 album <a href="Hidden%20%28These%20New%20Puritans%20album%29">Hidden</a> makes heavy use of the instrument throughout; their principal songwriter, Jack Barnett, claimed repeatedly to be ""writing a lot of music for bassoon"" in the run-up to its recording. In early 2011, American <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip-hop</a> artist <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a> updated his <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account to inform followers that he recently added the bassoon to a yet unnamed song.

The rock band <a href="Better%20Than%20Ezra">Better Than Ezra</a> took their name from a passage in <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s "<a href="A%20Moveable%20Feast">A Moveable Feast</a>" in which the author comments that listening to an annoyingly talkative person is still “better than Ezra learning how to play the bassoon,” referring to <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>.

British <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic</a>/<a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> band <a href="Knifeworld%20%28British%20rock%20band%29">Knifeworld</a> features the bassoon playing of Chloe Herrington, who also plays for <a href="Experimental%20music">experimental</a> <a href="Baroque%20pop">chamber rock</a> orchestra <a href="Chrome%20Hoof">Chrome Hoof</a>.

The bassoon is held diagonally in front of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be easily supported by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is usually required; the most common ones are a seat strap attached to the base of the boot joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or a neck strap or shoulder harness attached to the top of the boot joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a neck strap or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a "balance hanger" is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the point of support closer to the center of gravity, adjusting the distribution of weight between the two hands.

The bassoon is played with both hands in a stationary position, the left above the right, with five main finger holes on the front of the instrument (nearest the audience) plus a sixth that is activated by an open-standing key. Five additional keys on the front are controlled by the little fingers of each hand. The back of the instrument (nearest the player) has twelve or more keys to be controlled by the thumbs, the exact number varying depending on model.

To stabilize the right hand, many bassoonists use an adjustable comma-shaped apparatus called a "crutch," or a hand rest, which mounts to the boot joint. The crutch is secured with a thumb screw, which also allows the distance that it protrudes from the bassoon to be adjusted. Players rest the curve of the right hand where the thumb joins the palm against the crutch. The crutch also keeps the right hand from tiring and enables the player to keep the finger pads flat on the finger holes and keys.

An aspect of bassoon technique not found on any other woodwind is called "flicking". It involves the left hand thumb momentarily pressing, or 'flicking' the high A, <a href="C%20%28musical%20note%29">C</a> and <a href="D%20%28musical%20note%29">D</a> keys at the beginning of certain notes in the middle octave to achieve a clean slur from a lower note. This eliminates cracking, or brief <a href="multiphonics">multiphonics</a> that happens without the use of this technique.

Flicking is not universal amongst bassoonists; some American players, principally on the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a>, use it sparingly, if at all. The rest use it virtually 100% of the time—it has become in essence part of the fingering.

The alternative method is "venting", which requires that the register key be used as part of the full fingering as opposed to being open momentarily at the start of the note. This is sometimes called the "European Style."

While flicking is used to higher notes, the whisper key is used for lower notes. From the A right below middle C and lower, the whisper key is pressed with the left thumb and held for the duration of the note. This prevents cracking, as low notes can sometimes crack into a higher octave. Both flicking and using the whisper key is especially important to ensure notes speak properly during slurring between high and low registers.

While bassoons are usually critically tuned at the factory, the player nonetheless has a great degree of flexibility of pitch control through the use of breath support, <a href="embouchure">embouchure</a>, and reed profile. Players can also use alternate fingerings to adjust the pitch of many notes. Similar to other woodwind instruments, the length of the bassoon can be increased to lower pitch or decreased to raise pitch. On the bassoon, this is done preferably by changing the bocal to one of a different length, (lengths are denoted by a number on the bocal, usually starting at 0 for the shortest length, and 3 for the longest, but there are some manufacturers who will use other numbers) but it is possible to push the bocal in or out to adjust the pitch.
The bassoon embouchure is a very important aspect of producing a full, round, and dark bassoon tone. The bassoon embouchure is made by opening one's mouth, rolling lips inward to cover the teeth, and then dropping the jaw down as in a yawning motion (without actually yawning or opening the mouth). Both upper and lower teeth should be covered by the lips in order to protect the reed and control applied pressure. The reed is then placed in the mouth, with the lips and facial muscles maintaining an airtight seal around the reed. The upper lip will be farther forward on the reed than the lower lip, as in an "overbite" of the upper jaw.

The left thumb alone operates nine keys: B, B, C, D, D, C (also B), two keys when combined create A, and the whisper key. The whisper key should be held down for notes between and including F and G and certain other notes. Additional notes can be created with the left thumb keys. The D and bottom key above the whisper key on the tenor joint (C key) together create both C and C. The same bottom tenor-joint key is also used, with additional fingering, to create E and F. D and C together create C. When the two keys on the tenor joint to create A are used with slightly altered fingering on the boot joint, B is created. The whisper key may also be used throughout the instrument's register, along with other fingerings, to produce either a more muted or more piercing sound.

The right thumb operates four keys. The top key is used to produce B and B, and is used in B, C, D, F, and E. The large circular key, otherwise known as the "pancake key", is held down for all the lowest notes from E down to B. It is also used, like the whisper key, in additional fingerings for muting the sound. For example, in <a href="Ravel">Ravel</a>'s "<a href="Bol%C3%A9ro">Boléro</a>", the bassoon is asked to play the ostinato on G. This is easy to perform with the normal fingering for G, but with the E key (pancake key). The next key operated by the right thumb is known as the "spatula key": its primary use is to produce F and F. The bottom key is used less often: is used to produce A (G) and A (G), when the tone may be improved by combining this with the backmost key E of the right hand little finger: this is most advantageous in pieces like <a href="Paul%20Dukas">Dukas</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sorcerer%27s%20Apprentice">The Sorcerer's Apprentice</a>".

The four fingers of the left hand can each be used in at least two different positions, three in the case of the index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on the centre hole on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a <a href="Polisi%20Artist">Polisi Artist</a> bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C. The upper key is used for E, E, F, F, A, B, B, C, C, and D.

The four fingers of the right hand have at least one assignment each. The index finger stays over one hole, except that when E is played a side key at the top of the boot is used. The middle finger remains stationary over the hole with a ring around it, and this ring and other pads are lifted when the smallest finger on the right hand pushes a lever. The ring finger typically remains stationary on the lower ring-finger key. However, the upper ring-finger key can be used, typically for B and B, in place of the top thumb key on the front of the boot joint. The smallest finger operates three keys. The backmost one, closest to the bassoonist, is held down throughout most of the bass register. The key is not used after F is played. F is created with this key, as well as G, B, B, and C. The lowest key for the smallest finger on the right hand is primarily used for A (G) and A (G) but can be used E, and F. The frontmost key is used with the bottom thumb key on the boot joint to create A and A.

Many extended techniques can be performed on the bassoon, such as <a href="multiphonic">multiphonic</a>s, <a href="flutter-tonguing">flutter-tonguing</a>, <a href="circular%20breathing">circular breathing</a>, <a href="tonguing">double tonguing</a>, and harmonics. In the case of the bassoon, flutter-tonguing may be accomplished by "gargling" in the back of the throat as well as by the conventional method of rolling Rs. Multiphonics on the bassoon can be achieved by using particular alternative fingerings.

Also, using certain fingerings, notes may be produced on the instrument that sound lower pitches than the actual range of the instrument. These "impossible notes" tend to sound very gravelly and out of tune, but technically sound below the low B. Alternatively, lower notes can be produced by inserting a small paper or rubber tube into the end of the bell, which converts the lower B into a lower note such as an A natural; this lowers the pitch of the instrument, but has the positive effect of bringing the lowest register (which is typically quite sharp) into tune. A notable piece that calls for the use of a low A bell is <a href="Carl%20Nielsen">Carl Nielsen</a>'s <a href="Wind%20Quintet%20%28Nielsen%29">Wind Quintet</a>, op. 43, which includes an optional low A for the final cadence of the work. Bassoonists sometimes use the end bell segment of an English horn or clarinet if one is available instead of a specially made extension. This often yields unsatisfactory results, though, as the resultant A can be quite sharp. The idea of using low A was begun by <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, who wanted to extend the range of the bassoon. Many passages in his later operas require the low A as well as the B-flat above. (This is impossible on a normal bassoon using an A extension as the fingering for the B-flat yields the low A.) These passages are typically realized on the contrabassoon, as recommended by the composer. Some bassoons have been made to allow bassoonists to realize similar passages. These bassoons are made with a "Wagner bell" which is an extended bell with a key for both the low A and the low B-flat. Bassoons with Wagner bells suffer similar intonational deficiencies as a bassoon with an A extension. Another composer who has required the bassoon to be <a href="Diatonic%20and%20chromatic">chromatic</a> down to low A is <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>. <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> also calls for the low A in his opera "<a href="Intermezzo%20%28opera%29">Intermezzo</a>".

The complicated fingering and the problem of reeds make the bassoon more of a challenge to learn than some of the other woodwind instruments. Cost is another big factor in a person's decision to pursue the bassoon. Prices range from $3,000 up to $250,000 for a good-quality instrument. In North America, schoolchildren typically take up bassoon only after starting on another reed instrument, such as clarinet or saxophone.

Students in America often begin to pursue the study of bassoon performance and technique in the middle years of their music education. Students are often provided with a school instrument and encouraged to pursue lessons with private instructors. Students typically receive instruction in proper posture, hand position, embouchure, tone production, and reed making.

Bassoon reeds, made of "<a href="Arundo%20donax">Arundo donax</a>" cane, are often made by the players themselves, although beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and "gouged" to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or "profiled", by removing material from the bark side. This can be done by hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel <a href="mandrel">mandrel</a> (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the "throat," and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.

After the reed has dried, the wires are tightened around the reed, which has shrunk after drying, or replaced completely. The lower part is sealed (a <a href="nitrocellulose">nitrocellulose</a>-based cement such as Duco may be used) and then wrapped with thread to ensure both that no air leaks out through the bottom of the reed and that the reed maintains its shape. The wrapping itself is often sealed with Duco or clear nail varnish (polish). Electrical tape can also be used as a wrapping for amateur reed makers. The bulge in the wrapping is sometimes referred to as the "Turk's head"—it serves as a convenient handle when inserting the reed on the bocal.
Recently, more players are choosing the more modern heat-shrink tubing instead of the time-consuming and fiddly thread.

To finish the reed, the end of the reed blank, originally at the center of the unfolded piece of cane, is cut off, creating an opening. The blades above the first wire are now roughly long. For the reed to play, a slight bevel must be created at the tip with a knife, although there is also a machine that can perform this function. Other adjustments with the reed knife may be necessary, depending on the hardness, the profile of the cane, and the requirements of the player. The reed opening may also need to be adjusted by squeezing either the first or second wire with the pliers. Additional material may be removed from the sides (the "channels") or tip to balance the reed. Additionally, if the "e" in the bass clef staff is sagging in pitch, it may be necessary to "clip" the reed by removing from its length using a pair of very sharp scissors or the equivalent.

Playing styles of individual bassoonists vary greatly; because of this, most advanced players will make their own reeds, in the process customizing them to their individual playing requirements. Many companies and individuals do offer reeds for sale, but even with store-bought reeds, players must know how to make adjustments to suit their particular playing style.

The tools used for adjusting reeds are very similar to those used to make the reeds themselves.

Little is known about the early construction of the bassoon reed, as few examples survive, and much of what is known is only what can be gathered from artistic representations. The earliest known written instructions date from the middle of the 17th century, describing the reed as being held together by wire or resined thread; the earliest actual reeds that survive are more than a century younger, a collection of 21 reeds from the late 18th-century Spanish "bajon".







Companies that manufacture German (Heckel system) bassoons include:
In addition, several factories in the People's Republic of China are producing inexpensive instruments under such labels as Laval, Haydn, and Lark, and these have been available in the West for some time now. However, they are generally of marginal quality and are usually avoided by serious players.

Companies that manufacture Buffet (French) system bassoons include:

Bipedalism

Bipedalism is a form of <a href="terrestrial%20locomotion">terrestrial locomotion</a> where an organism <a href="Motion%20%28physics%29">moves</a> by means of its two rear <a href="Limb%20%28anatomy%29">limbs</a> or <a href="leg">leg</a>s. An <a href="animal">animal</a> or <a href="machine">machine</a> that usually moves in a bipedal manner is known as a biped , meaning "two feet" (from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "bis" for "double" and "pes" for "foot"). Types of bipedal movement include <a href="walking">walking</a>, <a href="running">running</a>, or <a href="jumping">hopping</a>.

Few modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. Within <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, habitual bipedalism has evolved multiple times, with the <a href="Macropodidae">macropod</a>s, <a href="Dipodomyinae">kangaroo rats and mice</a>, <a href="springhare">springhare</a>, <a href="hopping%20mice">hopping mice</a>, <a href="pangolin">pangolin</a>s and <a href="hominina">hominina</a>n apes, as well as various other extinct groups evolving the trait independently. In the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period some groups of <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>s (a group that includes the ancestors of <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s) developed bipedalism; among their descendants the <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s, all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the <a href="bird">bird</a>s descended from one group of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs.

A larger number of modern species intermittently or briefly use a bipedal gait. Several non-archosaurian <a href="lizard">lizard</a> species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment. Several arboreal primate species, such as <a href="gibbon">gibbon</a>s and <a href="Indriidae">indriids</a>, exclusively walk on two legs during the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating. Some animals commonly stand on their hind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or predator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.

The word is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "bi(s)" 'two' and "ped-" 'foot', as contrasted with <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadruped</a> 'four feet'.

Limited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages. Bipedalism raises the head; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources, access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths. While upright, non-locomotory <a href="Limb%20%28anatomy%29">limb</a>s become free for other uses, including manipulation (in primates and rodents), flight (in birds), digging (in giant pangolin), combat (in bears, great apes and the large monitor lizard) or camouflage (in certain species of octopus). The maximum bipedal speed appears less fast than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone – both the <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a> and the <a href="red%20kangaroo">red kangaroo</a> can reach speeds of , while the <a href="cheetah">cheetah</a> can exceed .
Even though bipedalism is slower at first, over long distances, it has allowed humans to outrun most other animals according to the <a href="endurance%20running%20hypothesis">endurance running hypothesis</a>. Bipedality in <a href="kangaroo%20rat">kangaroo rat</a>s has been hypothesized to improve locomotor performance, which could aid in escaping from predators.

Zoologists often label behaviors, including bipedalism, as "facultative" (i.e. optional) or "obligate" (the animal has no reasonable alternative). Even this distinction is not completely clear-cut — for example, humans other than infants normally walk and run in biped fashion, but almost all can crawl on hands and knees when necessary. There are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground, but these cases are a result of conditions such as <a href="Uner%20Tan%20syndrome">Uner Tan syndrome</a> — very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior. Even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness, there are many unclear cases, including the fact that "normal" humans can crawl on hands and knees. This article therefore avoids the terms "facultative" and "obligate", and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion "normally" used by various groups of animals.

There are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism.


The great majority of living terrestrial vertebrates are quadrupeds, with bipedalism exhibited by only a handful of living groups. Humans, gibbons and large birds <a href="walking">walk</a> by raising one foot at a time. On the other hand, most macropods, smaller birds, lemurs and bipedal rodents move by hopping on both legs simultaneously. <a href="Tree%20kangaroo">Tree kangaroo</a>s are able to walk or hop, most commonly alternating feet when moving arboreally and hopping on both feet simultaneously when on the ground.

There are no known living or fossil bipedal amphibians.

Many species of <a href="lizards">lizards</a> become bipedal during high-speed, sprint locomotion, including the world's fastest lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (genus "<a href="Ctenosaura">Ctenosaura</a>").

The first known biped is the <a href="bolosaurid">bolosaurid</a> "<a href="Eudibamus">Eudibamus</a>" whose fossils date from 290 million years ago. Its long hindlegs, short forelegs, and distinctive joints all suggest bipedalism. The species became extinct in the early Permian.

All <a href="birds">birds</a> are bipeds when on the ground, a feature inherited from their <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> ancestors.

Bipedalism evolved more than once in <a href="archosaurs">archosaurs</a>, the group that includes both dinosaurs and <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns. All dinosaurs are thought to be descended from a fully bipedal ancestor, perhaps similar to "<a href="Eoraptor">Eoraptor</a>". Bipedal movement also re-evolved in a number of other <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> lineages such as the <a href="iguanodon">iguanodon</a>s. Some extinct members of the <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>n line, a sister group to the dinosaurs and birds, also evolved bipedal forms - a <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a> relative from the <a href="triassic">triassic</a>, "<a href="Effigia%20okeeffeae">Effigia okeeffeae</a>", is thought to be bipedal. <a href="Pterosaur">Pterosaur</a>s were previously thought to have been bipedal, but recent trackways have all shown quadrupedal locomotion. Bipedalism also evolved independently among the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs diverged from their <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a> ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period, roughly 20 million years after the <a href="Permian-Triassic%20extinction%20event">Permian-Triassic extinction event</a> wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. <a href="Radiometric%20dating">Radiometric dating</a> of fossils from the early dinosaur <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Eoraptor">Eoraptor</a>" establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists suspect "Eoraptor" resembles the <a href="Common%20descent">common ancestor</a> of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as "<a href="Marasuchus">Marasuchus</a>" and "<a href="Lagerpeton">Lagerpeton</a>" in <a href="Argentina">Argentinian</a> <a href="Middle%20Triassic">Middle Triassic</a> strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.

A number of groups of extant mammals have independently evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion - for example humans, <a href="giant%20pangolin">giant pangolin</a>s, the extinct <a href="Megatheriidae">giant ground sloths</a>, numerous species of jumping <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s and <a href="Macropodidae">macropod</a>s. Humans, as their bipedalism has been extensively studied, are documented in the next section. Macropods are believed to have evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution, at some time no later than 45 million years ago.
Bipedal movement is less common among <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, most of which are <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>al. All primates possess some bipedal ability, though most species primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land. Primates aside, the <a href="Macropodidae">macropod</a>s (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), <a href="Dipodomyinae">kangaroo rats and mice</a>, <a href="hopping%20mice">hopping mice</a> and <a href="springhare">springhare</a> move bipedally by hopping. Very few mammals other than primates commonly move bipedally by an alternating gait rather than hopping. Exceptions are the <a href="ground%20pangolin">ground pangolin</a> and in some circumstances the <a href="tree%20kangaroo">tree kangaroo</a>. One black bear, <a href="Pedals%20%28bear%29">Pedals</a>, became famous locally and on the internet for having a frequent bipedal gait, although this is attributed to injuries on the bear's front paws.

Most bipedal animals move with their backs close to horizontal, using a long tail to balance the weight of their bodies. The primate version of bipedalism is unusual because the back is close to upright (completely upright in humans). Many primates can stand upright on their hind legs without any support. 
<a href="Chimpanzee">Chimpanzee</a>s, <a href="bonobo">bonobo</a>s, <a href="gibbon">gibbon</a>s and <a href="baboon">baboon</a>s exhibit forms of bipedalism. On the ground <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s move like all <a href="Indriidae">indrids</a> with bipedal sideways hopping movements of the hind legs, holding their forelimbs up for balance. <a href="Gelada">Gelada</a>s, although usually quadrupedal, will sometimes move between adjacent feeding patches with a squatting, shuffling bipedal form of locomotion.

The evolution of <a href="human%20clade">human</a> <a href="Human%20skeletal%20changes%20due%20to%20bipedalism">bipedalism</a>, began in primates about four million years ago, or as early as seven million years ago with "<a href="Sahelanthropus%23Fossils">Sahelanthropus</a>". One hypothesis for human bipedalism is that it evolved as a result of differentially successful survival from carrying food to share with group members, although there are alternative hypotheses.

Injured individuals

Injured chimpanzees and bonobos have been capable of sustained bipedalism.

Three captive primates, one macaque <a href="Natasha%20%28monkey%29">Natasha</a> and two chimps, <a href="Oliver%20%28chimpanzee%29">Oliver</a> and Poko (chimpanzee), were found to move bipedally . Natasha switched to exclusive bipedalism after an illness, while Poko was discovered in captivity in a tall, narrow cage. Oliver reverted to <a href="knuckle-walking">knuckle-walking</a> after developing arthritis. Non-human primates often use bipedal locomotion when carrying food.

Other mammals engage in limited, non-locomotory, bipedalism. A number of other animals, such as <a href="rat">rat</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, and <a href="beaver">beaver</a>s will squat on their hindlegs to manipulate some objects but revert to four limbs when moving (the beaver will move bipedally if transporting wood for their <a href="Beavers%23Dams">dams</a>, as will the raccoon when holding food). <a href="Bear">Bear</a>s will fight in a bipedal stance to use their forelegs as weapons. A number of mammals will adopt a bipedal stance in specific situations such as for feeding or fighting. <a href="Ground%20squirrel">Ground squirrel</a>s and <a href="meerkat">meerkat</a>s will stand on hind legs to survey their surroundings, but will not walk bipedally. <a href="Dog">Dog</a>s (e.g. <a href="Faith%20%28dog%29">Faith</a>) can stand or move on two legs if trained, or if birth defect or injury precludes <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>alism. The <a href="gerenuk">gerenuk</a> antelope stands on its hind legs while eating from trees, as did the extinct <a href="Megatherium">giant ground sloth</a> and <a href="chalicothere">chalicothere</a>s. The <a href="spotted%20skunk">spotted skunk</a> will <a href="Hand%20walking">walk on its front legs</a> when threatened, rearing up on its front legs while facing the attacker so that its <a href="anal%20glands">anal glands</a>, capable of spraying an offensive oil, face its attacker.

Bipedalism is unknown among the <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s. Among the non-<a href="archosaur">archosaur</a> <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s bipedalism is rare, but it is found in the 'reared-up' running of <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s such as <a href="Agamidae">agamids</a> and <a href="monitor%20lizard">monitor lizard</a>s. Many reptile species will also temporarily adopt bipedalism while fighting. One genus of <a href="Basiliscus%20%28genus%29">basilisk lizard</a> can run bipedally across the surface of water for some distance. Among <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, <a href="cockroach">cockroach</a>es are known to move bipedally at high speeds. Bipedalism is rarely found outside <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial animal</a>s, though at least two types of <a href="octopus">octopus</a> walk bipedally on the sea floor using two of their arms, allowing the remaining arms to be used to camouflage the octopus as a mat of algae or a floating coconut.

There are at least twelve distinct hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans, and also some debate as to when. Bipedalism evolved well before the large human brain or the development of stone tools. Bipedal specializations are found in "<a href="Australopithecus">Australopithecus</a>" fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although "<a href="Sahelanthropus%23Fossils">Sahelanthropus</a>" may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago. Nonetheless, the evolution of bipedalism was accompanied by significant evolutions in the spine including the forward movement in position of the foramen magnum, where the spinal cord leaves the cranium. Recent evidence regarding modern human <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> (physical differences between male and female) in the <a href="lumbar%20spine">lumbar spine</a> has been seen in pre-modern primates such as "<a href="Australopithecus%20africanus">Australopithecus africanus</a>". This dimorphism has been seen as an evolutionary adaptation of females to bear lumbar load better during <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>, an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make. Adapting bipedalism would have required less shoulder stability, which allowed the shoulder and other limbs to become more independent of each other and adapt for specific suspensory behaviors. In addition to the change in shoulder stability, changing locomotion would have increased the demand for shoulder mobility, which would have propelled the evolution of bipedalism forward. The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism. It is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running, which came later still.

Numerous causes for the evolution of human bipedalism involve freeing the hands for carrying and using tools, <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in provisoning, changes in climate and environment (from <a href="jungle">jungle</a> to <a href="savanna">savanna</a>) that favored a more elevated eye-position, and to reduce the amount of skin exposed to the tropical sun. It is possible that bipedalism provided a variety of benefits to the hominin species, and scientists have suggested multiple reasons for evolution of human bipedalism. There also is not only question of why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal but also why did hominins become more bipedal over time. For example, the postural feeding hypothesis explains for how earliest hominins became for the benefit of reaching out for food in trees while the savanna-based theory describes how the late hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal.

Napier (1963) argued that it was very unlikely that single factor drove the evolution of Bipedalism. He stated ""It seems unlikely that any single factor was responsible for such a dramatic change in behaviour. In addition to the advantages of accruing from ability to carry objects - food or otherwise - the improvement of the visual range and the freeing of the hands for purposes of defence and offence must equally have played their part as catalysts.”" Sigmon argued that chimpanzees demonstrate bipedalism in different contexts, and one single factor should be used to explain bipedalism: preadaptation for human bipedalism. Day (1986) emphasized three major pressures that drove evolution of bipedalism 1.food acquisition 2. predator avoidance 3. Reproductive success. Ko (2015) states there are two questions regarding bipedalism 1. Why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal 2. why did hominins become more bipedal over time. He argues that these questions can be answered with combination of prominent theories such as Savanna-based, Postural feeding, and Provisioning.

According to the Savanna-based theory, <a href="hominines">hominines</a> descended from the trees and adapted to life on the savanna by walking erect on two feet. The theory suggests that early hominids were forced to adapt to bipedal locomotion on the open savanna after they left the trees. This theory is closely related to the knuckle-walking hypothesis, which states that human ancestors used quadrupedal locomotion on the savanna, as evidenced by morphological characteristics found in "Australopithecus anamensis" and "Australopithecus afarensis" forelimbs, and that it is less parsimonious to assume that knuckle walking developed twice in genera Pan and Gorilla instead of evolving it once as synapomorphy for Pan and Gorilla before losing it in Australopithecus. The evolution of an orthograde posture would have been very helpful on a savanna as it would allow the ability to look over tall grasses in order to watch out for predators, or terrestrially hunt and sneak up on prey. It was also suggested in P.E. Wheeler's "The evolution of bipedality and loss of functional body hair in hominids", that a possible advantage of bipedalism in the savanna was reducing the amount of surface area of the body exposed to the sun, helping regulate body temperature. In fact, <a href="Elizabeth%20Vrba">Elizabeth Vrba</a>’s <a href="turnover-pulse%20hypothesis">turnover pulse hypothesis</a> supports the savanna-based theory by explaining the shrinking of forested areas due to global warming and cooling, which forced animals out into the open grasslands and caused the need for hominids to acquire bipedality.

Rather, the bipedal adaptation hominines had already achieved was used in the savanna. The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. It is possible that Bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait. Humans and orangutans are both unique to a bipedal reactive adaptation when climbing on thin branches, in which they have increased hip and knee extension in relation to the diameter of the branch, which can increase an arboreal feeding range and can be attributed to a convergent evolution of bipedalism evolving in arboreal environments. Hominine fossils found in dry grassland environments led anthropologists to believe hominines lived, slept, walked upright, and died only in those environments because no hominine fossils were found in forested areas. However, fossilization is a rare occurrence—the conditions must be just right in order for an organism that dies to become fossilized for somebody to find later, which is also a rare occurrence. The fact that no hominine fossils were found in forests does not ultimately lead to the conclusion that no hominines ever died there. The convenience of the savanna-based theory caused this point to be overlooked for over a hundred years.

Some of the fossils found actually showed that there was still an adaptation to arboreal life. For example, <a href="Lucy%20%28Australopithecus%29">Lucy</a>, the famous "<a href="Australopithecus%20afarensis">Australopithecus afarensis</a>", found in Hadar in Ethiopia, which may have been forested at the time of Lucy’s death, had curved fingers that would still give her the ability to grasp tree branches, but she walked bipedally. “<a href="Little%20Foot">Little Foot</a>,” the collection of "<a href="Australopithecus%20africanus">Australopithecus africanus</a>" foot bones, has a divergent big toe as well as the ankle strength to walk upright. “Little Foot” could grasp things using his feet like an ape, perhaps tree branches, and he was bipedal. Ancient pollen found in the soil in the locations in which these fossils were found suggest that the area used to be much more wet and covered in thick vegetation and has only recently become the arid desert it is now.

An alternative explanation is the mixture of savanna and scattered forests increased terrestrial travel by proto-humans between clusters of trees, and bipedalism offered greater efficiency for long-distance travel between these clusters than quadrupedalism. In an experiment monitoring chimpanzee metabolic rate via oxygen consumption, it was found that the quadrupedal and bipedal energy costs were very similar, implying that this transition in early ape-like ancestors would have not have been very difficult or energetically costing. This increased travel efficiency is likely to have been selected for as it assisted the wide dispersal of early hominids across the savanna to create start populations.

The postural feeding hypothesis has been recently supported by Dr. Kevin Hunt, a professor at Indiana University. This hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they eat. While on the ground, they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was used to reach up to grab for an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits because they were so convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with <a href="chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a> arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, "<a href="Australopithecus%20afarensis">Australopithecus afarensis</a>" has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the "<a href="Australopithecus">Australopithecus</a>" hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to <a href="humans">humans</a>. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture.

A similar study conducted by Thorpe et al. looked at how the most arboreal great ape, the orangutan, held onto supporting branches in order to navigate branches that were too flexible or unstable otherwise. They found that in more than 75% of locomotive instances the orangutans used their hands to stabilize themselves while they navigated thinner branches. They hypothesized that increased fragmentation of forests where A. afarensis as well as other ancestors of modern humans and other apes resided could have contributed to this increase of bipedalism in order to navigate the diminishing forests. Their findings also shed light on a couple of discrepancies observed in the anatomy of A. afarensis, such as the ankle joint, which allowed it to “wobble” and long, highly flexible forelimbs. The idea that bipedalism started from walking in trees explains both the increased flexibility in the ankle as well as the long limbs which would be used to grab hold of branches.

One theory on the origin of bipedalism is the behavioral model presented by <a href="Owen%20Lovejoy%20%28anthropologist%29">C. Owen Lovejoy</a>, known as "male provisioning". Lovejoy theorizes that the <a href="evolution">evolution</a> of bipedalism was linked to monogamy. In the face of long inter-birth intervals and low reproductive rates typical of the apes, early <a href="hominids">hominids</a> engaged in pair-bonding that enabled greater parental effort directed towards rearing offspring. Lovejoy proposes that male provisioning of food would improve the offspring survivorship and increase the pair's reproductive rate. Thus the male would leave his mate and offspring to search for food and return carrying the food in his arms walking on his legs. This model is supported by the reduction ("feminization") of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as "<a href="Sahelanthropus%20tchadensis">Sahelanthropus tchadensis</a>" and "<a href="Ardipithecus%20ramidus">Ardipithecus ramidus</a>", which along with low body size dimorphism in "Ardipithecus" and "Australopithecus", suggests a reduction in inter-male antagonistic behavior in early hominids. In addition, this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation (permanently enlarged breasts, lack of <a href="sexual%20swelling">sexual swelling</a>) and low sperm competition (moderate sized testes, low sperm mid-piece volume) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system.

However, this model has generated some controversy, as others have argued that early bipedal hominids were instead polygynous. Among most monogamous primates, males and females are about the same size. That is <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> is minimal, and other studies have suggested that <a href="Australopithecus%20afarensis">Australopithecus afarensis</a> males were nearly twice the weight of females. However, Lovejoy's model posits that the larger range a provisioning male would have to cover (to avoid competing with the female for resources she could attain herself) would select for increased male body size to limit predation risk. Furthermore, as the species became more bipedal, specialized feet would prevent the infant from conveniently clinging to the mother - hampering the mother's freedom and thus make her and her offspring more dependent on resources collected by others. Modern monogamous primates such as <a href="gibbon">gibbon</a>s tend to be also territorial, but fossil evidence indicates that "Australopithecus afarensis" lived in large groups. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a group living primate.

Recent studies of 4.4 million years old "<a href="Ardipithecus%20ramidus">Ardipithecus ramidus</a>" suggest bipedalism, it is thus possible that bipedalism evolved very early in <a href="homininae">homininae</a> and was reduced in chimpanzee and gorilla when they became more specialized. According to Richard Dawkins in his book "<a href="The%20Ancestor%27s%20Tale">The Ancestor's Tale</a>", chimps and bonobos are descended from "<a href="Australopithecus">Australopithecus</a>" gracile type species while gorillas are descended from <a href="Paranthropus">Paranthropus</a>. These apes may have once been bipedal, but then lost this ability when they were forced back into an arboreal habitat, presumably by those australopithecines from whom eventually evolved hominins. Early <a href="homininae">homininae</a>s such as "<a href="Ardipithecus%20ramidus">Ardipithecus ramidus</a>" may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in <a href="chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>s and <a href="gorilla">gorilla</a>s and towards efficient walking and running in <a href="modern%20humans">modern humans</a> (see figure). It is also proposed that one cause of <a href="Neanderthal%20extinction">Neanderthal extinction</a> was a less efficient running.

<a href="Joseph%20Jordania">Joseph Jordania</a> from the University of Melbourne recently (2011) suggested that bipedalism was one of the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids, based on <a href="aposematism">aposematism</a>, or <a href="warning%20display">warning display</a> and <a href="intimidation">intimidation</a> of potential predators and competitors with exaggerated visual and audio signals. According to this model, hominids were trying to stay as visible and as loud as possible all the time. Several morphological and behavioral developments were employed to achieve this goal: upright bipedal posture, longer legs, long tightly coiled hair on the top of the head, <a href="body%20painting">body painting</a>, threatening synchronous body movements, loud voice and extremely loud rhythmic singing/stomping/drumming on external subjects. Slow locomotion and strong body odor (both characteristic for hominids and humans) are other features often employed by aposematic species to advertise their non-profitability for potential predators.

There are a variety of ideas which promote a specific change in behaviour as the key driver for the evolution of hominid bipedalism. For example, Wescott (1967) and later Jablonski & Chaplin (1993) suggest that bipedal threat displays could have been the transitional behaviour which led to some groups of apes beginning to adopt bipedal postures more often. Others ("e.g." Dart 1925) have offered the idea that the need for more vigilance against predators could have provided the initial motivation. Dawkins ("e.g." 2004) has argued that it could have begun as a kind of fashion that just caught on and then escalated through sexual selection. And it has even been suggested ("e.g." Tanner 1981:165) that male phallic display could have been the initial incentive, as well as increased sexual signaling in upright female posture.

The thermoregulatory model explaining the origin of bipedalism is one of the simplest theories so far advanced, but it is a viable explanation. Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation. When a hominid is higher above the ground, the organism accesses more favorable wind speeds and temperatures. During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of <a href="Ardipithecus">Ardipithecus</a> reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the <a href="forest">forest</a> and <a href="woodland">woodland</a> environmental <a href="preadaptation">preadaptation</a> of early-stage <a href="hominid">hominid</a> bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>. This then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>, rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus. A feedback mechanism from the advantages of bipedality in hot and open habitats would then in turn make a forest preadaptation solidify as a permanent state.

Charles Darwin wrote that "Man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands, which are so admirably adapted to the act of obedience of his will". Darwin (1871:52) and many models on bipedal origins are based on this line of thought. Gordon Hewes (1961) suggested that the carrying of meat "over considerable distances" (Hewes 1961:689) was the key factor. Isaac (1978) and Sinclair et al. (1986) offered modifications of this idea, as indeed did Lovejoy (1981) with his "provisioning model" described above. Others, such as Nancy Tanner (1981), have suggested that infant carrying was key, while others again have suggested stone tools and weapons drove the change. This stone-tools theory is very unlikely, as though ancient humans were known to hunt, the discovery of tools was not discovered for thousands of years after the origin of bipedalism, chronologically precluding it from being a driving force of evolution. (Wooden tools and spears fossilize poorly and therefore it is difficult to make a judgment about their potential usage.)

The observation that large primates, including especially the great apes, that predominantly move quadrupedally on dry land, tend to switch to bipedal locomotion in waist deep water, has led to the idea that the origin of human bipedalism may have been influenced by waterside environments. This idea, labelled "the wading hypothesis", was originally suggested by the <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a> <a href="marine%20biologist">marine biologist</a> <a href="Alister%20Hardy">Alister Hardy</a> who said: "It seems to me likely that Man learnt to stand erect first in water and then, as his balance improved, he found he became better equipped for standing up on the shore when he came out, and indeed also for running." It was then promoted by <a href="Elaine%20Morgan%20%28writer%29">Elaine Morgan</a>, as part of the <a href="aquatic%20ape%20hypothesis">aquatic ape hypothesis</a>, who cited bipedalism among a cluster of other human traits unique among primates, including voluntary control of breathing, hairlessness and subcutaneous fat. The "<a href="aquatic%20ape%20hypothesis">aquatic ape hypothesis</a>", as originally formulated, has not been accepted or considered a serious theory within the anthropological scholarly community. Others, however, have sought to promote wading as a factor in the origin of human bipedalism without referring to further ("aquatic ape" related) factors. Since 2000 <a href="Carsten%20Niemitz">Carsten Niemitz</a> has published a series of papers and a book on a variant of the wading hypothesis, which he calls the "amphibian generalist theory" ().

Other theories have been proposed that suggest wading and the exploitation of aquatic food sources (providing essential nutrients for human brain evolution or critical fallback foods) may have exerted evolutionary pressures on human ancestors promoting adaptations which later assisted full-time bipedalism. It has also been thought that consistent water-based food sources had developed early hominid dependency and facilitated dispersal along seas and rivers.

Bipedal movement occurs in a number of ways, and requires many mechanical and neurological adaptations. Some of these are described below.

Energy-efficient means of standing bipedally involve constant adjustment of balance, and of course these must avoid <a href="feedback">overcorrection</a>. The difficulties associated with simple standing in upright humans are highlighted by the greatly increased risk of falling present in the elderly, even with minimal reductions in control system effectiveness.

Shoulder stability would decrease with the evolution of bipedalism. Shoulder mobility would increase because the need for a stable shoulder is only present in arboreal habitats. Shoulder mobility would support suspensory locomotion behaviors which are present in human bipedalism. The forelimbs are freed from weight bearing capabilities which makes the shoulder a place of evidence for the evolution of bipedalism.

Walking is characterized by an "inverted pendulum" movement in which the <a href="center%20of%20gravity">center of gravity</a> vaults over a stiff leg with each step. <a href="Force%20plate">Force plate</a>s can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two. Interestingly, this model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics.

In humans, walking is composed of several separate processes:

Running is characterized by a spring-mass movement. Kinetic and potential energy are in phase, and the energy is stored & released from a spring-like limb during foot contact. Again, the whole-body kinetics are similar to animals with more limbs.

Bipedalism requires strong leg muscles, particularly in the thighs. Contrast in <a href="domestication">domesticated</a> <a href="poultry">poultry</a> the well muscled legs, against the small and bony wings. Likewise in humans, the <a href="quadriceps">quadriceps</a> and <a href="hamstring">hamstring</a> muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities that each alone is much larger than the well-developed biceps of the arms.

A biped has the ability to breathe while running, without strong coupling to stride cycle. Humans usually take a breath every other stride when their <a href="aerobic%20glycolysis">aerobic</a> system is functioning. During a sprint the anaerobic system kicks in and breathing slows until the anaerobic system can no longer sustain a sprint.

For nearly the whole of the 20th century, bipedal <a href="robot">robot</a>s were very difficult to construct and <a href="robot%20locomotion">robot locomotion</a> involved only wheels, treads, or multiple legs. Recent cheap and compact computing power has made two-legged robots more feasible. Some notable biped robots are <a href="ASIMO">ASIMO</a>, <a href="HUBO">HUBO</a>, <a href="MABEL%28robot%29">MABEL</a> and <a href="QRIO">QRIO</a>. Recently, spurred by the success of creating a fully passive, un-powered bipedal walking robot, those working on such machines have begun using principles gleaned from the study of human and animal locomotion, which often relies on passive mechanisms to minimize power consumption.

Bootstrapping

In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input. In <a href="computer%20technology">computer technology</a> the term (usually shortened to booting) usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> which will then take care of loading other software as needed.

The term appears to have originated in the early 19 century United States (particularly in the phrase "pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps"), to mean an absurdly impossible action, an <a href="adynaton">adynaton</a>.

Tall <a href="boot">boot</a>s may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a <a href="Boot%20jack">boot hook</a> tool to help pulling the boots on. The <a href="saying">saying</a> "to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps" was already in use during the 19 century as an example of an impossible task. The <a href="idiom">idiom</a> dates at least to 1834, when it appeared in the "Workingman's Advocate": "It is conjectured that Mr. Murphee will now be enabled to hand himself over the Cumberland river or a barn yard fence by the straps of his boots." In 1860 it appeared in a comment on <a href="philosophy%20of%20mind">philosophy of mind</a>: "The attempt of the mind to analyze itself [is] an effort analogous to one who would lift himself by his own bootstraps." Bootstrap as a metaphor, meaning to better oneself by one's own unaided efforts, was in use in 1922. This metaphor spawned additional metaphors for a series of self-sustaining processes that proceed without external help.

The term is sometimes attributed to a story in <a href="Rudolf%20Erich%20Raspe">Rudolf Erich Raspe</a>'s "", but in that story <a href="Baron%20Munchausen">Baron Munchausen</a> pulls himself (and his horse) out of a swamp by his hair (specifically, his pigtail), not by his bootstraps and no explicit reference to bootstraps has been found elsewhere in the various versions of the Munchausen tales.

Booting is the process of starting a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage. It is in this sense that the computer "pulls itself up by its bootstraps", "i.e." it improves itself by its own efforts. Booting is a chain of events that starts with execution of hardware-based procedures and may then hand-off to <a href="firmware">firmware</a> and software which is loaded into <a href="main%20memory">main memory</a>. Booting often involves processes such as performing <a href="power-on%20self-test">self-tests</a>, loading <a href="computer%20configuration">configuration</a> settings, loading a <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a>, <a href="resident%20monitor">resident monitor</a>s, a <a href="hypervisor">hypervisor</a>, an <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>, or <a href="utility%20software">utility software</a>.

The computer term bootstrap began as a metaphor in the 1950s. In computers, pressing a bootstrap button caused a <a href="hardwired%20control">hardwired program</a> to read a bootstrap program from an input unit. The computer would then execute the bootstrap program, which caused it to read more program instructions. It became a self-sustaining process that proceeded without external help from manually entered instructions. As a computing term, bootstrap has been used since at least 1953.

Bootstrapping can also refer to the development of successively more complex, faster programming environments. The simplest environment will be, perhaps, a very basic text editor ("e.g.", <a href="ed%20%28UNIX%29">ed</a>) and an <a href="Assembly%20language%23Assembler">assembler</a> program. Using these tools, one can write a more complex text editor, and a simple compiler for a higher-level language and so on, until one can have a <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical</a> <a href="integrated%20development%20environment">IDE</a> and an extremely <a href="high-level%20programming%20language">high-level programming language</a>.

Historically, bootstrapping also refers to an early technique for computer program development on new hardware. The technique described in this paragraph has been replaced by the use of a <a href="cross%20compiler">cross compiler</a> executed by a pre-existing computer. Bootstrapping in program development began during the 1950s when each program was constructed on paper in decimal code or in binary code, bit by bit (1s and 0s), because there was no high-level computer language, no <a href="compiler">compiler</a>, no assembler, and no <a href="Linker%20%28computing%29">linker</a>. A tiny assembler program was hand-coded for a new computer (for example the <a href="IBM%20650">IBM 650</a>) which converted a few instructions into binary or decimal code: A1. This simple assembler program was then rewritten in its just-defined <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a> but with extensions that would enable the use of some additional mnemonics for more complex operation codes. The enhanced assembler's source program was then assembled by its predecessor's executable (A1) into binary or decimal code to give A2, and the cycle repeated (now with those enhancements available), until the entire instruction set was coded, branch addresses were automatically calculated, and other conveniences (such as conditional assembly, macros, optimisations, etc.) established. This was how the early assembly program SOAP (<a href="Symbolic%20Optimal%20Assembly%20Program">Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program</a>) was developed. Compilers, linkers, loaders, and utilities were then coded in assembly language, further continuing the bootstrapping process of developing complex software systems by using simpler software.

The term was also championed by <a href="Doug%20Engelbart">Doug Engelbart</a> to refer to his belief that organizations could better evolve by improving the process they use for improvement (thus obtaining a compounding effect over time). His <a href="SRI%20International">SRI</a> team that developed the <a href="NLS%20%28computer%20system%29">NLS</a> hypertext system applied this strategy by using the tool they had developed to improve the tool.

The development of compilers for new programming languages first developed in an existing language but then rewritten in the new language and compiled by itself, is another example of the bootstrapping notion. Using an existing language to bootstrap a new language is one way to solve the "<a href="chicken%20or%20the%20egg">chicken or the egg</a>" causality dilemma.

During the installation of computer programs it is sometimes necessary to update the installer or package manager itself. The common pattern for this is to use a small executable bootstrapper file ("e.g." setup.exe) which updates the installer and starts the real installation after the update. Sometimes the bootstrapper also installs other prerequisites for the software during the bootstrapping process.

A bootstrapping node, also known as a rendezvous host, is a <a href="Node%20%28networking%29">node</a> in an <a href="overlay%20network">overlay network</a> that provides initial configuration information to newly joining nodes so that they may successfully join the overlay network.

A type of <a href="computer%20simulation">computer simulation</a> called <a href="discrete%20event%20simulation">discrete event simulation</a> represents the operation of a system as a chronological sequence of events. A technique called "bootstrapping the simulation model" is used, which bootstraps initial data points using a <a href="pseudorandom%20number%20generator">pseudorandom number generator</a> to schedule an initial set of pending events, which schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its <a href="steady%20state">steady state</a>—the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior.

Bootstrapping is a technique used to iteratively improve a <a href="classifier%20%28machine%20learning%29">classifier</a>'s performance. Seed AI is a hypothesized type of <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> capable of <a href="Intelligence%20explosion">recursive self-improvement</a>. Having improved itself, it would become better at improving itself, potentially leading to an exponential increase in intelligence. No such AI is known to exist, but it remains an active field of research.

Seed AI is a significant part of some theories about the <a href="technological%20singularity">technological singularity</a>: proponents believe that the development of seed AI will rapidly yield ever-smarter intelligence (via bootstrapping) and thus a new era.

Bootstrapping is a <a href="resampling%20%28statistics%29">resampling</a> technique used to obtain estimates of summary statistics.

<a href="Bootstrapping%20%28business%29">Bootstrapping in business</a> means starting a business without external help or capital. Such startups fund the development of their company through internal cash flow and are cautious with their expenses. Generally at the start of a venture, a small amount of money will be set aside for the bootstrap process. Bootstrapping can also be a supplement for <a href="econometric">econometric</a> models. Bootstrapping was also expanded upon in the book "Bootstrap Business" by <a href="Richard%20J.%20Christiansen">Richard Christiansen</a>, the Harvard Business Review article "The Art of Bootstrapping" and the follow-up book "The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses" by <a href="Amar%20Bhide">Amar Bhide</a>.


<a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> in his book "River Out of Eden" used the computer bootstrapping concept to explain how biological cells differentiate: "Different cells receive different combinations of chemicals, which switch on different combinations of genes, and some genes work to switch other genes on or off. And so the bootstrapping continues, until we have the full repertoire of different kinds of cells."

Bootstrapping analysis gives a way to judge the strength of support for clades on <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a>s. A number is written by a node, which reflects the percentage of bootstrap trees which also resolve the <a href="clade">clade</a> at the endpoints of that branch.

Bootstrapping is a rule preventing the admission of hearsay evidence in conspiracy cases.

Bootstrapping is a theory of language acquisition.

Bootstrapping is using very general consistency criteria to determine the form of a quantum theory from some assumptions on the spectrum of particles or operators.

In <a href="Tokamaks">tokamak</a> fusion devices, bootstrapping refers to the process in which a <a href="bootstrap%20current">bootstrap current</a> is self-generated by the plasma, which reduces or eliminates the need for an external current driver. Maximising the bootstrap current is a major goal of advanced tokamak designs.

Bootstrapping in <a href="Inertial%20confinement%20fusion">Inertial Confinement Fusion</a> refers to the alpha particles produced in the fusion reaction providing further heating to the plasma. This heating leads to ignition and an overall energy gain.

Bootstrapping is a form of positive feedback in analog circuit design.

An electric power grid is almost never brought down intentionally. Generators and power stations are started and shut down as necessary. A typical power station requires power for start up prior to being able to generate power. This power is obtained from the grid, so if the entire grid is down these stations cannot be started.

Therefore, to get a grid started, there must be at least a small number of power stations that can start entirely on their own. A <a href="black%20start">black start</a> is the process of restoring a power station to operation without relying on external power. In the absence of grid power, one or more black starts are used to bootstrap the grid.

A Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) is an intermediary element in <a href="cellular%20network">cellular network</a>s which provides application independent functions for mutual <a href="authentication">authentication</a> of user equipment and servers unknown to each other and for 'bootstrapping' the exchange of secret session keys afterwards. The term 'bootstrapping' is related to building a security relation with a previously unknown device first and to allow installing security elements (keys) in the device and the BSF afterwards.

A media bootstrap is the process whereby a story or meme is deliberately (but artificially) produced by self and peer-referential journalism, originally within a tight circle of media content originators, often commencing with stories written within the same media organization. This story is then expanded into a general media "accepted wisdom" with the aim of having it accepted as self-evident "common knowledge" by the reading, listening and viewing publics. The key feature of a media bootstrap is that as little hard, verifiable, external evidence as possible is used to support the story, preference being given to the citation (often unattributed) of other media stories, "i.e." "journalists interviewing journalists".

Because the campaign is usually originated and at least initially concocted internally by a media organization with a particular agenda in mind, within a closed loop of reportage and opinionation, the campaign is said to have "pulled itself up by its own bootstraps".

A bootstrap campaign should be distinguished from a genuine news story of genuine interest, such as a natural disaster that kills thousands, or the death of a respected public figure. It is legitimate for these stories to be given coverage across all media platforms. What distinguishes a bootstrap from a real story is the contrived and organized manner in which the bootstrap appears to come out of nowhere. A bootstrap commonly claims to be tapping a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon within society.

As self-levitating by pulling on one's bootstraps is physically impossible, this is often used by the bootstrappers themselves to deny the possibility that the bootstrap campaign is indeed concocted and artificial. They assert that it has arisen via a groundswell of public opinion. Media campaigns that are openly admitted as concocted ("e.g." a public service campaign titled "Let's Clean Up Our City") are usually ignored by other media organizations for reasons related to competition. On the other hand, the true bootstrap welcomes the participation of other media organizations, indeed encourages it, as this participation gains the bootstrap notoriety and, most importantly, legitimacy.
