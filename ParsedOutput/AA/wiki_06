Algebraically closed field

In <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, an algebraically closed field "F" contains a <a href="Zero%20of%20a%20function">root</a> for every <a href="Degree%20of%20a%20polynomial">non-constant polynomial</a> in "F"["x"], the <a href="ring%20of%20polynomials">ring of polynomials</a> in the variable "x" with coefficients in "F".

As an example, the <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s is not algebraically closed, because the polynomial equation "x" + 1 = 0  has no solution in real numbers, even though all its coefficients (1 and 0) are real. The same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s is not algebraically closed. Also, no <a href="finite%20field">finite field</a> "F" is algebraically closed, because if "a", "a", …, "a" are the elements of "F", then the polynomial ("x" − "a")("x" − "a") ··· ("x" − "a") + 1
has no zero in "F". By contrast, the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20algebra">fundamental theorem of algebra</a> states that the field of <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s is algebraically closed. Another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of (complex) <a href="algebraic%20number">algebraic number</a>s.

Given a field "F", the assertion ""F" is algebraically closed" is equivalent to other assertions:

The field "F" is algebraically closed if and only if the only <a href="irreducible%20polynomial">irreducible polynomial</a>s in the <a href="polynomial%20ring">polynomial ring</a> "F"["x"] are those of degree one.

The assertion "the polynomials of degree one are irreducible" is trivially true for any field. If "F" is algebraically closed and "p"("x") is an irreducible polynomial of "F"["x"], then it has some root "a" and therefore "p"("x") is a multiple of "x" − "a". Since "p"("x") is irreducible, this means that "p"("x") = "k"("x" − "a"), for some "k" ∈ "F" \ {0}. On the other hand, if "F" is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial "p"("x") in "F"["x"] without roots in "F". Let "q"("x") be some irreducible factor of "p"("x"). Since "p"("x") has no roots in "F", "q"("x") also has no roots in "F". Therefore, "q"("x") has degree greater than one, since every first degree polynomial has one root in "F".

The field "F" is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial "p"("x") of degree "n" ≥ 1, with <a href="coefficient">coefficient</a>s in "F", <a href="factorization">splits into linear factors</a>. In other words, there are elements "k", "x", "x", …, "x" of the field "F" such that "p"("x") = "k"("x" − "x")("x" − "x") ··· ("x" − "x").

If "F" has this property, then clearly every non-constant polynomial in "F"["x"] has some root in "F"; in other words, "F" is algebraically closed. On the other hand, that the property stated here holds for "F" if "F" is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that, for any field "K", any polynomial in "K"["x"] can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.

J. Shipman showed in 2007 that if every polynomial over "F" of prime degree has a root in "F", then every non-constant polynomial has a root in "F", thus "F" is algebraically closed.

The field "F" is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper <a href="algebraic%20extension">algebraic extension</a>.

If "F" has no proper algebraic extension, let "p"("x") be some irreducible polynomial in "F"["x"]. Then the <a href="quotient%20ring">quotient</a> of "F"["x"] modulo the <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a> generated by "p"("x") is an algebraic extension of "F" whose <a href="degree%20of%20a%20field%20extension">degree</a> is equal to the degree of "p"("x"). Since it is not a proper extension, its degree is 1 and therefore the degree of "p"("x") is 1.

On the other hand, if "F" has some proper algebraic extension "K", then the <a href="Minimal%20polynomial%20%28field%20theory%29">minimal polynomial</a> of an element in "K" \ "F" is irreducible and its degree is greater than 1.

The field "F" is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite <a href="algebraic%20extension">algebraic extension</a> because if, within the <a href="Algebraically%20closed%20field%23The%20field%20has%20no%20proper%20algebraic%20extension">previous proof</a>, the word "algebraic" is replaced by the word "finite", then the proof is still valid.

The field "F" is algebraically closed if and only if, for each natural number "n", every <a href="linear%20map">linear map</a> from "F" into itself has some <a href="eigenvector">eigenvector</a>.

An endomorphism of "F" has an eigenvector if and only if its <a href="characteristic%20polynomial">characteristic polynomial</a> has some root. Therefore, when "F" is algebraically closed, every endomorphism of "F" has some eigenvector. On the other hand, if every endomorphism of "F" has an eigenvector, let "p"("x") be an element of "F"["x"]. Dividing by its leading coefficient, we get another polynomial "q"("x") which has roots if and only if "p"("x") has roots. But if "q"("x") = "x" + "a""x"+ ··· + "a", then "q"("x") is the characteristic polynomial of the "n×n" <a href="companion%20matrix">companion matrix</a>

The field "F" is algebraically closed if and only if every <a href="rational%20function">rational function</a> in one variable "x", with coefficients in "F", can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form "a"/("x" − "b"), where "n" is a natural number, and "a" and "b" are elements of "F".

If "F" is algebraically closed then, since the irreducible polynomials in "F"["x"] are all of degree 1, the property stated above holds by the <a href="Partial%20fraction%20decomposition%23Statement%20of%20theorem">theorem on partial fraction decomposition</a>.

On the other hand, suppose that the property stated above holds for the field "F". Let "p"("x") be an irreducible element in "F"["x"]. Then the rational function 1/"p" can be written as the sum of a polynomial function "q" with rational functions of the form "a"/("x" − "b"). Therefore, the rational expression
can be written as a quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is a product of first degree polynomials. Since "p"("x") is irreducible, it must divide this product and, therefore, it must also be a first degree polynomial.

For any field "F", if two polynomials "p"("x"),"q"("x") ∈ "F"["x"] are <a href="coprime">relatively prime</a> then they do not have a common root, for if "a" ∈ "F" was a common root, then "p"("x") and  "q"("x") would both be multiples of "x" − "a" and therefore they would not be relatively prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds (that is, the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime) are precisely the algebraically closed fields.

If the field "F" is algebraically closed, let "p"("x") and "q"("x") be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let "r"("x") be their <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a>. Then, since "r"("x") is not constant, it will have some root "a", which will be then a common root of "p"("x") and "q"("x").

If "F" is not algebraically closed, let "p"("x") be a polynomial whose degree is at least 1 without roots. Then "p"("x") and "p"("x") are not relatively prime, but they have no common roots (since none of them has roots).

If "F" is an algebraically closed field and "n" is a natural number, then "F" contains all "n"th roots of unity, because these are (by definition) the "n" (not necessarily distinct) zeroes of the polynomial "x" − 1. A field extension that is contained in an extension generated by the roots of unity is a "cyclotomic extension", and the extension of a field generated by all roots of unity is sometimes called its "cyclotomic closure". Thus algebraically closed fields are cyclotomically closed. The converse is not true. Even assuming that every polynomial of the form "x" − "a" splits into linear factors is not enough to assure that the field is algebraically closed.

If a proposition which can be expressed in the language of <a href="first-order%20logic">first-order logic</a> is true for an algebraically closed field, then it is true for every algebraically closed field with the same <a href="Characteristic%20%28algebra%29">characteristic</a>. Furthermore, if such a proposition is valid for an algebraically closed field with characteristic 0, then not only is it valid for all other algebraically closed fields with characteristic 0, but there is some natural number "N" such that the proposition is valid for every algebraically closed field with characteristic "p" when "p" > "N".

Every field "F" has some extension which is algebraically closed. Among all such extensions there is one and (<a href="Up%20to">up to isomorphism</a>, but not <a href="essentially%20unique">unique isomorphism</a>) only one which is an <a href="algebraic%20extension">algebraic extension</a> of "F"; it is called the <a href="algebraic%20closure">algebraic closure</a> of "F".

The theory of algebraically closed fields has <a href="quantifier%20elimination">quantifier elimination</a>.

Anatoly Karpov

Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov (; born May 23, 1951) is a Russian <a href="chess">chess</a> <a href="International%20Grandmaster">grandmaster</a> and former <a href="World%20Chess%20Championship">World Champion</a>. He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming <a href="FIDE">FIDE</a> World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world's elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the <a href="Comparison%20of%20top%20chess%20players%20throughout%20history">greatest players</a> of all time.

His tournament successes include over 160 first-place finishes. He had a peak <a href="Elo%20rating%20system">Elo rating</a> of 2780, and his 90 total months at world number one is the <a href="List%20of%20FIDE%20chess%20world%20number%20ones">second longest of all-time</a>, behind only <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, since the inception of the FIDE ranking list in 1970.

Karpov was born on May 23, 1951 at <a href="Zlatoust">Zlatoust</a> in the <a href="Urals">Urals</a> region of the former Soviet Union, and learned to play chess at the age of 4. His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a <a href="Candidate%20Master">Candidate Master</a> by age 11. At 12, he was accepted into <a href="Mikhail%20Botvinnik">Mikhail Botvinnik</a>'s prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following remark about the young Karpov: "The boy does not have a clue about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession." Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently. Karpov improved so quickly under Botvinnik's tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record established by <a href="Boris%20Spassky">Boris Spassky</a> in 1952.

Karpov finished first in his first international tournament in <a href="T%C5%99inec">Třinec</a> several months later, ahead of <a href="Viktor%20Kupreichik">Viktor Kupreichik</a>. In 1967, he won the annual European Junior Championship at <a href="Groningen">Groningen</a>. Karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school, and entered <a href="Moscow%20State%20University">Moscow State University</a> in 1968 to study mathematics. He later transferred to <a href="Leningrad%20State%20University">Leningrad State University</a>, eventually graduating from there in economics. One reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach, grandmaster <a href="Semyon%20Furman">Semyon Furman</a>, who lived in Leningrad. In his writings, Karpov credits Furman as a major influence on his development as a world-class player.

In 1969, Karpov became the first Soviet player since Spassky (1955) to win the <a href="World%20Junior%20Chess%20Championship">World Junior Chess Championship</a>, scoring an undefeated 10/11 in the finals at <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. In 1970, he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in <a href="Caracas">Caracas</a>, Venezuela, and was awarded the <a href="International%20Grandmaster">grandmaster</a> title.

He won the 1971 <a href="Alexander%20Alekhine">Alekhine</a> Memorial in Moscow (equal with <a href="Leonid%20Stein">Leonid Stein</a>), ahead of a star-studded field, for his first significant adult victory. His <a href="Elo%20rating%20system">Elo rating</a> shot from 2540 in 1971 to 2660 in 1973, when he shared second in the <a href="USSR%20Chess%20Championship">USSR Chess Championship</a>, and finished equal first with <a href="Viktor%20Korchnoi">Viktor Korchnoi</a> in the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a> <a href="Interzonal">Interzonal</a> Tournament. The latter success qualified him for the 1974 <a href="Candidates%20Matches">Candidates Matches</a>, which would determine the challenger to the reigning world champion, <a href="Bobby%20Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a>.

Karpov defeated <a href="Lev%20Polugaevsky">Lev Polugaevsky</a> by the score of +3=5 in the first Candidates' match, earning the right to face former champion <a href="Boris%20Spassky">Boris Spassky</a> in the semifinal round. Karpov was on record saying that he believed Spassky would easily beat him and win the Candidates' cycle to face Fischer, and that he (Karpov) would win the following Candidates' cycle in 1977.
Spassky won the first game as Black in good style, but tenacious, aggressive play from Karpov secured him overall victory by +4−1=6.
The Candidates' final was played in Moscow with Korchnoi. Karpov took an early lead, winning the second game against the <a href="Sicilian%20Defence">Sicilian Dragon</a>, then scoring another victory in the sixth game. Following ten consecutive <a href="draw%20%28chess%29">draws</a>, Korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give Karpov a 3–0 lead. In game 19, Korchnoi succeeded in winning a long <a href="chess%20endgame">endgame</a>, then notched a speedy victory after a <a href="blunder%20%28chess%29">blunder</a> by Karpov two games later. Three more draws, the last <a href="draw%20by%20agreement">agreed</a> by Karpov in a clearly better position, closed the match, as he thus prevailed +3−2=19, moving on to challenge Fischer for the world title.

Though a world championship match between Karpov and Fischer was highly anticipated, those hopes were never realised. Fischer not only insisted that the match be the first to ten wins (<a href="draw%20%28chess%29">draws</a> not counting), but also that the champion would retain the crown if the score was tied 9–9. <a href="FIDE">FIDE</a>, the International Chess Federation, refused to allow this proviso, and after Fischer's resignation of the championship on June 27, 1975, FIDE declared that Fischer forfeited his crown. Karpov later attempted to set up another match with Fischer, but all the negotiations fell through. This thrust the young Karpov into the role of World Champion without having faced the reigning champion.
<a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> argued that Karpov would have had good chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years. Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978.

Determined to prove himself a legitimate champion, Karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years. He convincingly won the very strong <a href="Milan">Milan</a> tournament in 1975, and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976. He created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world. Karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (nine) until it was shattered by <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> (14). As a result, most chess professionals eventually agreed that Karpov is a legitimate world champion.

In 1978, Karpov's first title defence was against Korchnoi, the opponent he had defeated in the 1973–75 Candidates' cycle; the match was played at <a href="Baguio">Baguio</a>, Philippines, with the winner needing six victories.
As in 1974, Karpov took an early lead, winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match, but Korchnoi staged a comeback late in the match, as, after the score was +5−2=20 in Karpov's favour, he won three of the next four games to draw level with Karpov. Karpov then won the next game to retain the title (+6−5=21).

Three years later Korchnoi re-emerged as the Candidates' winner against German finalist Dr. <a href="Robert%20H%C3%BCbner">Robert Hübner</a> to challenge Karpov in <a href="Merano">Merano</a>, Italy. This match, however, was won handily by Karpov, the score being (11–7, +6−2=10) in what is remembered as the "Massacre in Merano".

Karpov's tournament career reached a peak at the <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> "Tournament of Stars" tournament in 1979, where he finished joint first (+7−1=10) with <a href="Mikhail%20Tal">Mikhail Tal</a>, ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by <a href="Jan%20Timman">Jan Timman</a>, <a href="Ljubomir%20Ljubojevi%C4%87">Ljubomir Ljubojević</a>, <a href="Boris%20Spassky">Boris Spassky</a>, <a href="Vlastimil%20Hort">Vlastimil Hort</a>, <a href="Lajos%20Portisch">Lajos Portisch</a>, Robert Hübner, <a href="Bent%20Larsen">Bent Larsen</a> and <a href="Lubomir%20Kavalek">Lubomir Kavalek</a>. He dominated <a href="Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a> 1977 with 13½/15. He also won the prestigious <a href="Bugojno">Bugojno</a> tournament in 1978 (shared) and 1980, the <a href="Linares%20chess%20tournament">Linares tournament</a> in 1981 (shared with <a href="Larry%20Christiansen">Larry Christiansen</a>) and 1994, the <a href="Tilburg">Tilburg</a> tournament in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, and the <a href="USSR%20Chess%20Championship">Soviet Championship</a> in 1976, 1983, and 1988.

Karpov represented the Soviet Union at six <a href="Chess%20Olympiads">Chess Olympiads</a>, in all of which the USSR won the team gold medal. He played first reserve at <a href="20th%20Chess%20Olympiad">Skopje 1972</a>, winning the board prize with 13/15. At <a href="21st%20Chess%20Olympiad">Nice 1974</a>, he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with 12/14. At <a href="24th%20Chess%20Olympiad">La Valletta 1980</a>, he was again board one and scored 9/12. At <a href="25th%20Chess%20Olympiad">Lucerne 1982</a>, he scored 6½/8 on board one. At <a href="27th%20Chess%20Olympiad">Dubai 1986</a>, he scored 6/9 on board two. His last was <a href="28th%20Chess%20Olympiad">Thessaloniki 1988</a>, where on board two he scored 8/10. In Olympiad play, Karpov lost only two games out of 68 played.

To illustrate Karpov's dominance over his peers as champion, his score was +11−2=20 versus Spassky, +5=12 versus <a href="Robert%20H%C3%BCbner">Robert Hübner</a>, +6−1=16 versus <a href="Ulf%20Andersson">Ulf Andersson</a>, +3−1=10 versus <a href="Vasily%20Smyslov">Vasily Smyslov</a>, +1=16 versus <a href="Mikhail%20Tal">Mikhail Tal</a>, +10−2=13 versus Ljubojević.

Karpov had cemented his position as the world's best player and world champion by the time <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> arrived on the scene. In their first match, the <a href="World%20Chess%20Championship%201984">World Chess Championship 1984</a>, held in Moscow, with the victor again being the first to win six games outright, Karpov built a 4–0 lead after nine games. The next seventeen games were drawn, setting the record for world title matches, and it took Karpov until game 27 to gain his fifth win. In game 31, Karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw. He lost the next game, after which fourteen more draws ensued. In particular, Karpov held a solidly winning position in Game 41, but again blundered and had to settle for a draw. After Kasparov won games 47 and 48, FIDE President <a href="Florencio%20Campomanes">Florencio Campomanes</a> unilaterally terminated the match, citing the health of the players. The match had lasted an unprecedented five months, with five wins for Karpov, three for Kasparov, and forty draws.

A rematch was set for later in 1985, also in Moscow. The events of the so-called Marathon Match forced FIDE to return to the previous format, a match limited to 24 games (with Karpov remaining champion if the match should finish 12–12). Karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title, but wound up losing, thus surrendering the title to his opponent. The final score was 13–11 (+3−5=16), in favour of Kasparov.

Karpov remained a formidable opponent (and the world No. 2) until the early 1990s. He fought Kasparov in three more world championship matches in 1986 (held in London and <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a>), 1987 (held in <a href="Seville">Seville</a>), and 1990 (held in New York City and <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>). All three matches were extremely close: the scores were 11½ to 12½ (+4−5=15), 12 to 12 (+4−4=16), and 11½ to 12½ (+3−4=17). In all three matches, Karpov had winning chances up to the very last games. In particular, the 1987 Seville match featured an astonishing blunder by Kasparov in the 23rd game. In the final game, needing only a draw to win the title, Karpov cracked under pressure from the clock at the end of the first session of play, missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw, and allowed Kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn. After a further mistake in the second session, Karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64, ending the match and allowing Kasparov to keep the title.

In their five world championship matches, Karpov scored 19 wins, 21 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.

Karpov is on record saying that if he had had the opportunity to play Fischer for the crown in his twenties, he could have been a much better player as a result.

In 1992, Karpov lost a Candidates Match against <a href="Nigel%20Short">Nigel Short</a>. But in 1993, Karpov reacquired the FIDE World Champion title when Kasparov and Short split from FIDE. Karpov defeated Timman – the loser of the Candidates' final against Short.

The next major meeting of Kasparov and Karpov was the 1994 <a href="Linares%20chess%20tournament">Linares chess tournament</a>. The field, in eventual finishing order, was Karpov, <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Kasparov</a>, <a href="Alexei%20Shirov">Shirov</a>, <a href="Evgeny%20Bareev">Bareev</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Kramnik">Kramnik</a>, <a href="Jo%C3%ABl%20Lautier">Lautier</a>, <a href="Viswanathan%20Anand">Anand</a>, <a href="Gata%20Kamsky">Kamsky</a>, <a href="Veselin%20Topalov">Topalov</a>, <a href="Vassily%20Ivanchuk">Ivanchuk</a>, <a href="Boris%20Gelfand">Gelfand</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Illescas">Illescas</a>, <a href="Judit%20Polg%C3%A1r">Judit Polgár</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Beliavsky">Beliavsky</a>; with an average <a href="Elo%20rating%20system">Elo rating</a> of 2685, the highest ever at that time, making it the first Category XVIII tournament ever held. Impressed by the strength of the tournament, Kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments. Perhaps spurred on by this comment, Karpov played the best tournament of his life. He was undefeated and earned 11 points out of 13 possible (the best world-class tournament winning percentage since Alekhine won <a href="San%20Remo%201930%20chess%20tournament">San Remo in 1930</a>), finishing 2½ points ahead of second-place Kasparov and Shirov. Many of his wins were spectacular (in particular, his win over Topalov is considered possibly the finest of his career). This performance against the best players in the world put his <a href="Elo%20rating%20system">Elo rating</a> tournament performance at 2985, the highest <a href="Performance%20rating%20%28chess%29">performance rating</a> of any player in history up until 2009, when <a href="Magnus%20Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a> won the category XXI <a href="Pearl%20Spring%20chess%20tournament">Pearl Spring chess tournament</a> with a performance of 3002. However, chess statistician <a href="Jeff%20Sonas">Jeff Sonas</a> considered Karpov's Linares performance to be the best tournament result in history.

Karpov defended his FIDE title against <a href="Gata%20Kamsky">Gata Kamsky</a> (+6−3=9) in 1996. However, in 1998, FIDE largely scrapped the old system of Candidates' Matches, instead having a large knockout event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks. In the first of these events, the <a href="FIDE%20World%20Chess%20Championship%201998">FIDE World Chess Championship 1998</a>, champion Karpov was seeded straight into the final, defeating <a href="Viswanathan%20Anand">Viswanathan Anand</a> (+2−2=2, rapid tiebreak 2:0). In the subsequent cycle, the format was changed, with the champion having to qualify. Karpov refused to defend his title, and ceased to be FIDE World Champion after the <a href="FIDE%20World%20Chess%20Championship%201999">FIDE World Chess Championship 1999</a>.

Karpov's outstanding classical tournament play has been seriously limited since 1997, since he prefers to be more involved in politics of his home country of Russia. He had been a member of the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet">Supreme Soviet</a> Commission for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Soviet Peace Fund before the Soviet Union dissolved. In addition, he had been involved in several disputes with FIDE and became increasingly disillusioned with chess. In the September 2009 FIDE rating list, he dropped out of the world's Top 100 for the first time.

Karpov usually limits his play to exhibition events, and has revamped his style to specialize in rapid chess. In 2002 he won a match against Kasparov, defeating him in a rapid time control match 2½–1½. In 2006, he tied for first with Kasparov in a blitz tournament, ahead of Korchnoi and Judit Polgár.

Karpov and Kasparov played a mixed 12-game match from September 21–24, 2009, in <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, Spain. It consisted of four rapid (or semi rapid) and eight blitz games and took place exactly 25 years after the two players' legendary encounter at <a href="World%20Chess%20Championship%201984">World Chess Championship 1984</a>. Kasparov won the match 9–3.

Karpov played a match against <a href="Yasser%20Seirawan">Yasser Seirawan</a> in 2012 in St. Louis, Missouri, an important center of the North American chess scene, with Karpov winning the match 8–6 (+5−3=6) .

In November 2012, he won the Cap d'Agde rapid tournament which bears his name (Anatoly Karpov Trophy) by beating Vassily Ivanchuk (ranked 9th in the October 2012 FIDE world rankings) in the final.

Since 2005, he has been a member of the <a href="Public%20Chamber%20of%20Russia">Public Chamber of Russia</a>. He has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes, such as advocating the use of <a href="iodised%20salt">iodised salt</a>. On December 17, 2012, Karpov supported the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the US.

Karpov expressed support of the <a href="annexation%20of%20Crimea%20by%20the%20Russian%20Federation">annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation</a>, and accused Europe of trying to demonise Putin.

In March 2010 Karpov announced that he would be a candidate for the presidency of FIDE. The election took place in September 2010 at the <a href="39th%20Chess%20Olympiad">39th Chess Olympiad</a>. In May a fund-raising event took place in New York with the participation of his former rival Garry Kasparov and of Magnus Carlsen, both of whom supported his bid and campaigned for him. Also Nigel Short announced he supported Karpov's candidacy. However, on September 29, 2010, <a href="Kirsan%20Ilyumzhinov">Kirsan Ilyumzhinov</a> was reelected as President of FIDE, winning the election by 95 votes to 55.

Karpov's "<a href="boa%20constrictor">boa constrictor</a>" playing style is solidly positional, taking no risks but reacting mercilessly to any tiny errors made by his opponents. As a result, he is often compared to his idol, the famous <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ra%C3%BAl%20Capablanca">José Raúl Capablanca</a>, the third World Champion. Karpov himself describes his style as follows:Let us say the game may be continued in two ways: one of them is a beautiful tactical blow that gives rise to variations that don't yield to precise calculations; the other is clear positional pressure that leads to an endgame with microscopic chances of victory... I would choose [the latter] without thinking twice. If the opponent offers keen play I don't object; but in such cases I get less satisfaction, even if I win, than from a game conducted according to all the rules of strategy with its ruthless logic.


Karpov's extensive stamp collection of <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20Belgium">Belgium philately</a> and <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Belgian Congo stamps and postal history</a> covering mail from 1742 through 1980 was sold by <a href="David%20Feldman%20%28philatelist%29">David Feldman's</a> auction company between December 2011 and 2012. He is also known to have a large chess stamp and chess book collections. His private <a href="chess%20library">chess library</a> consists of over 9000 books.


Karpov has authored or co-authored several books, most of which have been translated into English.

Aspect ratio

The aspect ratio of a <a href="geometry">geometric</a> <a href="shape">shape</a> is the ratio of its sizes in different dimensions. For example, the aspect ratio of a <a href="rectangle">rectangle</a> is the <a href="ratio">ratio</a> of its longer side to its shorter sidethe ratio of width to height, when the rectangle is oriented as a "landscape".

The aspect ratio is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (x:y). The values x and y do not represent actual widths and heights but, rather, the relationship between width and height. As an example, 8:5, 16:10 and 1.6:1 are three ways of representing the same aspect ratio.

In objects of more than two dimensions, such as <a href="hyperrectangle">hyperrectangle</a>s, the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side.

The term is most commonly used with reference to:

For a rectangle, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle. A <a href="square">square</a> has the smallest possible aspect ratio of 1:1.

Examples:

For an ellipse, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the <a href="major%20axis">major axis</a> to the <a href="minor%20axis">minor axis</a>. An ellipse with an aspect ratio of 1:1 is a circle.

In <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, there are several alternative definitions to aspect ratios of general <a href="compact%20set">compact set</a>s in a d-dimensional space:


If the dimension d is fixed, then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors.

Aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as "x":"y" (pronounced "x-to-y").

Cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a (rounded) decimal multiple of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height. In <a href="digital%20image">digital image</a>s there is a subtle distinction between the "Display" Aspect Ratio (the image as displayed) and the <a href="Storage%20Aspect%20Ratio">"Storage" Aspect Ratio</a> (the ratio of pixel dimensions); see <a href="Aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29%23Distinctions">Distinctions</a>.

Auto racing

Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing, or automobile racing) is a <a href="sport">sport</a> involving the <a href="racing">racing</a> of <a href="automobiles">automobiles</a> for competition.

Almost as soon as automobiles had been invented, races of various sorts were organised, with the first recorded as early as 1867. Many of the earliest events were effectively <a href="Classic%20trials">reliability trials</a>, aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport, but soon became an important way for competing makers to demonstrate their machines. By the 1930s specialist racing cars had developed.
There are now numerous different categories, each with different rules and regulations.

The first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred at 4:30 A.M. on August 30, 1867, between <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne">Ashton-under-Lyne</a> and <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, a distance of eight miles. It was won by the carriage of <a href="Isaac%20Watt%20Boulton">Isaac Watt Boulton</a>.

Internal combustion auto racing events began soon after the construction of the first successful <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a>-fueled automobiles. The first organized contest was on April 28, 1887, by the chief editor of Paris publication "Le Vélocipède", Monsieur Fossier. It ran from Neuilly Bridge to the Bois de Boulogne.

On July 22, 1894, the Parisian magazine "<a href="Le%20Petit%20Journal%20%28newspaper%29">Le Petit Journal</a>" organized what is considered to be the world's first motoring competition, from Paris to Rouen. One hundred and two competitors paid a 10-franc entrance fee.

The first American automobile race is generally held to be the Thanksgiving Day <a href="Chicago%20Times-Herald%20race">"Chicago Times-Herald" race</a> of November 28, 1895. Press coverage of the event first aroused significant American interest in the automobile.

With auto construction and racing dominated by France, the French automobile club ACF staged a number of major international races, usually from or to Paris, connecting with another major city, in France or elsewhere in Europe.
<a href="Brooklands">Brooklands</a>, in Surrey, was the first purpose-built motor racing venue, opening in June 1907. It featured a concrete track with high-speed banked corners.

One of the oldest existing purpose-built automobile racing circuits in the United States, still in use, is the 2.5-mile (4.02 km)-long <a href="Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a> in <a href="Speedway%2C%20Indiana">Speedway, Indiana</a>. It is the largest capacity sports venue of any variety worldwide, with a top capacity of some 257,000+ seated spectators.

NASCAR was founded by Bill France, Sr. on February 21, 1948, with the help of several other drivers of the time. The first NASCAR "Strictly Stock" race ever was held on June 19, 1949, at <a href="Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Daytona Beach, Florida</a>.

From 1962, sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars, with the FIA replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.

From 1972 through 2003, NASCAR's premier series was called the Winston Cup Series, sponsored by <a href="R.%20J.%20Reynolds%20Tobacco%20Company">R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company</a> cigarette brand <a href="Winston%20%28cigarette%29">Winston</a>. The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement, as well as the reduction of the schedule from 48 to 31 races a year, established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's "modern era".

The IMSA GT Series evolved into the <a href="American%20Le%20Mans%20Series">American Le Mans Series</a>, which ran its first season in 1999. The European races eventually became the closely related <a href="Le%20Mans%20Series">Le Mans Series</a>, both of which mix prototypes and GTs.

The two most popular varieties of open wheel racing are <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> and the <a href="IndyCar%20Series">IndyCar Series</a>.

Formula One is a European-based series that runs only street and road courses. These cars are very technologically advanced, and are very fast through turns. These cars can go 375 kph (233 mph). Some of the famous races they run are the Monaco Grand Prix, the Italian Grand Prix, and the British Grand Prix. The season ends with the crowning of the World Championship for drivers and constructors.

In single-seater (<a href="open-wheel">open-wheel</a>), the wheels are not covered, and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce <a href="downforce">downforce</a> and enhance adhesion to the track. In Europe and Asia, open-wheeled racing is commonly referred to as "Formula", with appropriate hierarchical suffixes. In North America, the "Formula" terminology is not followed (with the exception of F1). The sport is usually arranged to follow an international format (such as F1), a regional format (such as the Formula 3 Euro Series), and/or a domestic, or country-specific, format (such as the German Formula 3 championship, or the British Formula Ford).

In the Americas, the most popular series is the <a href="American%20Championship%20Car%20Racing">National Championship</a>, more commonly known as the IndyCar Series and previously known as <a href="Champ%20Car">CART</a>). The cars have traditionally been similar though less technologically sophisticated than <a href="F1%20cars">F1 cars</a>, with more restrictions on technology aimed at controlling costs. While these cars are not as technologically advanced, they are faster, being able to average a lap at 388 kph (241 mph). The series' biggest race is the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a>, which is commonly referred to as "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing" due to being the longest continuously run race and having the largest crowd for a single-day sporting event (350,000+).

The other major international single-seater racing series is <a href="GP2%20Series">GP2</a> (formerly known as <a href="Formula%203000">Formula 3000</a> and <a href="Formula%20Two">Formula Two</a>). Regional series include <a href="Formula%20Nippon">Formula Nippon</a> and <a href="Formula%20V6%20Asia">Formula V6 Asia</a> (specifically in Asia), <a href="Formula%20Renault%203.5">Formula Renault 3.5</a> (also known as the World Series by Renault, succession series of <a href="World%20Series%20by%20Nissan">World Series by Nissan</a>), <a href="Formula%20Three">Formula Three</a>, <a href="Formula%20Palmer%20Audi">Formula Palmer Audi</a> and <a href="Formula%20Atlantic">Formula Atlantic</a>. In 2009, the <a href="FIA%20Formula%20Two%20Championship%20%282009%E2%80%932012%29">FIA Formula Two Championship</a> brought about the revival of the F2 series. Domestic, or country-specific, series include Formula Three and Formula Renault, with the leading introductory series being <a href="Formula%20Ford">Formula Ford</a>.

Single-seater racing is not limited merely to professional teams and drivers. There exist many amateur racing clubs. In the UK, the major club series are the <a href="Monoposto%20Racing%20Club">Monoposto Racing Club</a>, BRSCC F3 (Formerly ClubF3, formerly ARP F3), Formula Vee and Club Formula Ford. Each series caters for a section of the market, with some primarily providing low-cost racing, while others aim for an authentic experience using the same regulations as the professional series (BRSCC F3).

There are other categories of single-seater racing, including <a href="kart%20racing">kart racing</a>, which employs a small, low-cost machine on small tracks. Many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts. <a href="Formula%20Ford">Formula Ford</a> represents the most popular first open-wheel category for up-and-coming drivers stepping up from karts. The series is still the preferred option, as it has introduced an aero package and slicks, allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer F1. The <a href="Star%20Mazda%20Series">Star Mazda Series</a> is another entry-level series.

Students at colleges and universities can also take part in single-seater racing through the <a href="Formula%20SAE">Formula SAE</a> competition, which involves designing and building a single-seater car in a multidisciplinary team and racing it at the competition. This also develops other soft skills, such as teamwork, while promoting motorsport and engineering.

The world's first all-female Formula racing team was created in 2006. The group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines and formed for an MTV reality pilot, which was shot at <a href="Mazda%20Raceway%20Laguna%20Seca">Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca</a>.
In December 2005, the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">FIA</a> gave approval to <a href="Superleague%20Formula">Superleague Formula</a> racing, which debuted in 2008, whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> and <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a>

After 25 years away from the sport, former <a href="Formula%202">Formula 2</a> champion <a href="Jonathan%20Palmer">Jonathan Palmer</a> reopened the F2 category again; most drivers have graduated from the <a href="Formula%20Palmer%20Audi">Formula Palmer Audi</a> series. The category is officially registered as the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">FIA</a> Formula Two championship. Most rounds have two races and are support races to the <a href="FIA%20World%20Touring%20Car%20Championship">FIA World Touring Car Championship</a>.

Touring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production-derived race cars. It often features full-contact racing due to the small speed differentials and large grids.

The major touring car championships conducted worldwide are the <a href="Supercars%20Championship">Supercars Championship</a> (Australia), <a href="British%20Touring%20Car%20Championship">British Touring Car Championship</a>, <a href="Deutsche%20Tourenwagen%20Masters">Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters</a> (DTM), and the <a href="World%20Touring%20Car%20Championship">World Touring Car Championship</a>. The <a href="European%20Touring%20Car%20Cup">European Touring Car Cup</a> is a one-day event open to <a href="Super%202000">Super 2000</a> specification touring cars from Europe's many national championships.

The <a href="Sports%20Car%20Club%20of%20America">Sports Car Club of America</a>'s <a href="SPEED%20World%20Challenge">SPEED World Challenge</a> Touring Car and GT championships are dominant in North America. America's historic <a href="Trans-Am%20Series">Trans-Am Series</a> is undergoing a period of transition, but is still the longest-running road racing series in the U.S. The <a href="National%20Auto%20Sport%20Association">National Auto Sport Association</a> also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home-built factory-derived vehicles on various local circuits.

In <a href="sports%20car%20racing">sports car racing</a>, production-derived versions of <a href="sports%20cars">sports cars</a>, also known as grand tourers (GTs), and purpose-built <a href="sports%20prototype">sports prototype</a> cars compete within their respective classes on closed circuits. The premier championship series of sports car racing is the <a href="FIA%20World%20Endurance%20Championship">FIA World Endurance Championship</a>. The main series for GT car racing is the <a href="FIA%20GT1%20World%20Championship">FIA GT1 World Championship</a>. There is also the <a href="FIA%20GT3%20European%20Championship">FIA GT3 European Championship</a> as well as the less powerful <a href="GT4%20European%20Cup">GT4 European Cup</a>. Previously, an intermediate <a href="FIA%20GT2%20European%20Championship">FIA GT2 European Championship</a> existed, but the FIA dropped it to cut costs. Other major GT championships include the Japanese <a href="Super%20GT">Super GT</a> championship and the <a href="International%20GT%20Open">International GT Open</a> for GT2 and GT3 cars. There are also national GT championships using mainly GT3 and GT4 cars featuring professional and amateur drivers alike.
Sports prototypes, unlike GT cars, do not rely on road-legal cars as a base. They are closed-wheel and often closed-cockpit purpose-built race cars intended mainly for endurance racing. They have much lower weight and more down force compared to GT cars, making them much faster. They are raced in the 24 hours of Le Mans (held annually since 1923) and in the (European) <a href="Le%20Mans%20series">Le Mans series</a>, <a href="Asian%20Le%20Mans%20Series">Asian Le Mans Series</a> and the <a href="WeatherTech%20SportsCar%20Championship">WeatherTech SportsCar Championship</a>. These cars are referred to as <a href="Le%20Mans%20Prototype">LMP</a> (Le Mans prototype) cars with LMP1 being run mainly by manufacturers and the slightly less powerful LMP2 cars run by privateer teams. All three Le Mans Series run GT cars in addition to Le Mans Prototypes; these cars have different restrictions than the FIA GT cars.

Another prototype and GT racing championship exists in the United States; the <a href="Grand%20American%20Road%20Racing%20Association">Grand-Am</a>, which began in 2000, sanctions its own endurance series, the <a href="Rolex%20Sports%20Car%20Series">Rolex Sports Car Series</a>, which consists of slower and lower-cost race cars compared to LMP and FIA GT cars. The <a href="Rolex%20Sports%20Car%20Series">Rolex Sports Car Series</a> and <a href="American%20Le%20Mans%20Series">American Le Mans Series</a> announced a merger between the two series forming the <a href="WeatherTech%20SportsCar%20Championship">WeatherTech SportsCar Championship</a> starting in 2014.

These races are often conducted over long distances, at least , and cars are driven by teams of two or more drivers, switching every few hours. Due to the performance difference between production-based sports cars and purpose-built sports prototypes, one race usually involves several racing classes, each fighting for their own championship.

Famous sports car races include the <a href="24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a>, the <a href="Rolex%2024%20at%20Daytona">Rolex 24 at Daytona</a>, <a href="Spa%2024%20Hours">24 Hours of Spa</a>-Franchorchamps, the <a href="12%20Hours%20of%20Sebring">12 Hours of Sebring</a>, the <a href="6%20Hours%20of%20Watkins%20Glen">6 Hours of Watkins Glen</a>, and the <a href="Petit%20Le%20Mans">Petit Le Mans</a> at <a href="Road%20Atlanta">Road Atlanta</a>. There is also the <a href="24%20Hours%20N%C3%BCrburgring">24 Hours of the Nürburgring</a> on the infamous Nordschleife track and the <a href="Dubai%2024%20Hour">Dubai 24 Hour</a>, which is aimed at GT3 and below cars with a mixture of professional and pro-am drivers.

Production-car racing, otherwise known as "showroom stock" in the US, is an economical and rules-restricted version of touring-car racing, mainly used to restrict costs. Numerous production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars.

Most series follow the <a href="Group%20N">Group N</a> regulation with a few exceptions. There are several different series that are run all over the world, most notably, Japan's Super Taikyu and <a href="International%20Motor%20Sports%20Association">IMSA</a>'s Firehawk Series, which ran in the 1980s and 1990s all over the United States.

One-make, or single marque, championships often employ production-based cars from a single manufacturer or even a single model from a manufacturer's range. There are numerous notable one-make formulae from various countries and regions, some of which – such as the <a href="Porsche%20Supercup">Porsche Supercup</a> and, previously, <a href="International%20Race%20of%20Champions">IROC</a> – have fostered many distinct national championships. Single marque series are often found at club level, to which the production-based cars, limited modifications, and close parity in performance are very well suited. Some of the better-known single-make series are the <a href="http%3A//www.mini7.co.uk">Mini 7 Championship</a> (Europe's longest-running one make championship), the <a href="Radical%20European%20Masters">Radical European Masters</a>, <a href="http%3A//www.minichallenge.co.uk">John Cooper Mini Challenge</a>, <a href="Renault%20Clio%20Cup">Clio Cup</a>, <a href="Ginetta%20Cars">Ginettas</a>, <a href="Caterham%20Racing">Caterhams</a>, <a href="Kumho%20BMW%20Championship">BMWs</a>, and <a href="MaX5%20Racing%20Championship">MX5s</a>. There are also single-chassis <a href="Open%20wheel%20car">single seater</a> formulae, such as <a href="Formula%20Renault">Formula Renault</a> and <a href="Formula%20BMW">Formula BMW</a>, usually as "feeder" series for "senior" race formula (in the fashion of <a href="farm%20team">farm team</a>s).

In North America, <a href="stock%20car%20racing">stock car racing</a> is the most popular form of auto racing. Primarily raced on <a href="Oval%20track%20racing">oval tracks</a>, stock cars vaguely resemble production cars, but are in fact purpose-built racing machines that are built to tight specifications and also called <a href="Silhouette%20racing%20car">Silhouette racing car</a>s.

The largest stock car racing governing body is <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing). NASCAR's premier series is the <a href="Monster%20Energy%20Cup%20Series">Monster Energy Cup Series</a>, its most famous races being the <a href="Daytona%20500">Daytona 500</a>, the <a href="Bojangles%20Southern%20500">Southern 500</a>, the <a href="Coca-Cola%20600">Coca-Cola 600</a>, and the <a href="Brickyard%20400">Brickyard 400</a>. NASCAR also runs several feeder series, including the <a href="Xfinity%20Series">Xfinity Series</a> and <a href="Camping%20World%20Truck%20Series">Camping World Truck Series</a> (a <a href="pickup%20truck">pickup truck</a> racing series). The series conduct races across the entire <a href="continental%20United%20States">continental United States</a>. The <a href="NASCAR%20Pinty%27s%20Series">NASCAR Pinty's Series</a> conducts races across Canada and the <a href="NASCAR%20PEAK%20Mexico%20Series">NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series</a> conducts races across Mexico.

NASCAR also governs several smaller regional series, such as the <a href="Whelen%20Modified%20Tour">Whelen Modified Tour</a>. Modified cars are best described as open-wheel cars. Modified cars have no parts related to the stock vehicle for which they are named after. A number of modified cars display a "manufacturer's" logo and "vehicle name", yet use components produced by another automobile manufacturer.

There are also other stock car governing bodies, most notably the <a href="Automobile%20Racing%20Club%20of%20America">Automobile Racing Club of America</a> (ARCA).

In the UK, <a href="British%20Stock%20car%20racing">British Stock car racing</a> is also referred to as "Short Circuit Racing". This takes place on shale or tarmac tracks – usually around 1/4 mile long. The governing bodies for the sport are the Oval Racing Council (ORC) and BriSCA. Both bodies are made up of individual stadium promoters. There are around 35 tracks in the UK and upwards of 7000 active drivers. The sport is split into three basic divisions – distinguished by the rules regarding car contact during racing. The most famous championship is the <a href="BriSCA%20F1%20Stock%20Cars">BriSCA F1 Stock Cars</a>. Full-contact formulas include Bangers, Bombers and Rookie Bangers – and racing features Demolitions Derbies, Figure of Eight racing and Oval Racing.

Semi Contact Formulas include BriSCA F1, F2 and Superstox – where bumpers are used tactically.

Non-contact formulas include National Hot Rods, Stock Rods and Lightning Rods.

UK Stock car racing started in the 1950s and grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s.

<a href="Rallying">Rallying</a> at international and most national championship levels involves two classes of <a href="Homologation%20%28motorsport%29">homologated</a> road-legal production-based cars; <a href="Group%20N">Group N</a> production cars and more modified <a href="Group%20A">Group A</a> cars. Cars compete on closed public roads or off-road areas on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers "rally" to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of "special stages" on any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand at reduced speeds compiling detailed shorthand descriptions of the track or road as they go. These detailed descriptions are known as pace notes. During the actual rally, the co-driver reads the pace notes aloud (using an in-helmet intercom system) to the driver, enabling them to complete each stage as quickly as possible. Competition is based on lowest total elapsed time over the course of an event's special stages, including penalties.

The top series is the <a href="World%20Rally%20Championship">World Rally Championship</a> (WRC), first contested in 1973, but there are also regional championships, and many countries have their own national championships. Some famous rallies include the <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20Rally">Monte Carlo Rally</a>, <a href="Rally%20Argentina">Rally Argentina</a>, <a href="Rally%20Finland">Rally Finland</a> and <a href="Rally%20GB">Rally GB</a>. Another famous event (actually best described as a <a href="rally%20raid">rally raid</a>) is the <a href="Paris-Dakar%20Rally">Paris-Dakar Rally</a>, conceived in 1978. There are also many smaller, club level, <a href="categories%20of%20rallies">categories of rallies</a>, which are popular with amateurs, making up the "grass roots" of motor sports.

The <a href="Targa%20Tasmania">Targa Tasmania</a>, held on the Australian island state of Tasmania and run annually since 1992, takes its name from the <a href="Targa%20Florio">Targa Florio</a>, a former motoring event held on the island of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the <a href="Mille%20Miglia">Mille Miglia</a>, the <a href="Coupe%20des%20Alpes">Coupe des Alpes</a> and the <a href="Tour%20de%20Corse">Tour de Corse</a>.

In drag racing, the objective is to complete a given straight-line distance, from a standing start, ahead of a vehicle in a parallel lane. This distance is traditionally ¼ mile (400 m), though ⅛ mile (200 m) has become popular since the 1990s. The vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time, depending on the class of racing. Vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built <a href="drag%20racing">dragster</a>. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. Average street cars cover the ¼ mile in 12 to 16 seconds, whereas a <a href="top%20fuel%20dragster">top fuel dragster</a> takes 4.5 seconds or less, reaching speeds of up to . Drag racing was organized as a sport by <a href="Wally%20Parks">Wally Parks</a> in the early 1950s through the <a href="NHRA">NHRA</a> (National Hot Rod Association). The NHRA was formed to discourage <a href="street%20racing">street racing</a>.

When launching, a top fuel dragster will accelerate at 3.4 <a href="g-force">g</a> (33 m/s²), and when braking parachutes are deployed the deceleration is 4 g (39 m/s²), more than the <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> experiences. A top fuel car can be heard over away and can generate a reading from 1.5 to 3.9 on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter scale</a>.
Drag racing is two cars head-to-head, the winner proceeding to the next round. Professional classes are all first to the finish line wins. Sportsman racing is handicapped (slower car getting a <a href="Head%20start%20%28positioning%29">head start</a>) using an index (a lowest e.t. allowed), and cars running under (quicker than) their index "break out" and lose. The slowest cars, bracket racers, are also handicapped, but rather than an index, they use a <a href="Drag%20racing%23Dial-in">dial-in</a>.

In <a href="off-road%20racing">off-road racing</a>, various classes of specially modified vehicles, including cars, compete in races through off-road environments. In North America these races often take place in the desert, such as the famous <a href="Baja%201000">Baja 1000</a>. Another format for off-road racing happens on closed-course <a href="Short%20course%20off%20road%20racing">short course tracks</a> such as <a href="Crandon%20International%20Off-Road%20Raceway">Crandon International Off-Road Raceway</a>. In the 1980s and 1990s, short course was extended to racing inside stadiums in the <a href="Mickey%20Thompson%20Entertainment%20Group">Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group</a>; this format was revived by <a href="Robby%20Gordon">Robby Gordon</a> in 2013 with his <a href="Speed%20Energy%20Formula%20Off-Road">Speed Energy Formula Off-Road</a> series.

In Europe, "offroad" refers to events such as autocross or rallycross, while desert races and rally-raids such as the <a href="Paris-Dakar%20Rally">Paris-Dakar</a>, Master Rallye or European "bajas" are called "cross-country rallies."

The modern kart was invented by Art Ingels, a fabricator at the legendary Indianapolis-car manufacturer Kurtis-Kraft, in Southern California in 1956. Ingels took a small chainsaw engine and mounted it to a simple tube-frame chassis weighing less than 100 lb. Ingels, and everyone else who drove the kart, were startled at its performance capabilities. The sport soon blossomed in Southern California, and quickly spread around the world. Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport, <a href="kart%20racing">kart racing</a>, or karting, can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. A large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts, often from a very young age, such as <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> and <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a>. Several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport, notably <a href="Wayne%20Rainey">Wayne Rainey</a>, who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand-controlled kart. As one of the cheapest ways to race, karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide.

Despite their diminutive size, karting's most powerful class, <a href="superkart">superkart</a>, can have a power-to-weight ratio of 440 hp/tonne.

As modern motor racing is centered on modern technology with a lots of corporate sponsors and politics involved, <a href="historical%20racing">historical racing</a> tends to be the opposite. Because it is based on a particular era it is more hobbyist oriented, reducing corporate sponsorship and politics. Events are regulated to only allow cars of a certain era to participate. The only modern equipment used is related to safety and timing. A historical event can be of a number of different motorsport disciplines.
Notably some of the most famous events of them all are the <a href="Goodwood%20Festival%20of%20Speed">Goodwood Festival of Speed</a> and <a href="Goodwood%20Revival">Goodwood Revival</a> in Britain and <a href="Monterey%20Historic">Monterey Historic</a> in the United States. Championships range from "grass root" <a href="Austin%207">Austin Seven</a> racing to the <a href="FIA%20Thoroughbred%20Grand%20Prix%20Championship">FIA Thoroughbred Grand Prix Championship</a> for classic <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> chassis.

While there are several professional teams and drivers in historical racing, this branch of <a href="auto%20sport">auto sport</a> tends to be contested by wealthy car owners and is thus more amateur and less competitive in its approach.

In many types of auto races, particularly those held on closed courses, flags are displayed to indicate the general status of the track and to communicate instructions to competitors. While individual series have different rules, and the flags have changed from the first years (e.g., red used to start a race), these are generally accepted.

For the worst accident in racing history see <a href="1955%20Le%20Mans%20disaster">1955 Le Mans disaster</a>.

In auto racing, the <a href="racing%20setup">racing setup</a> or car setup is the set of adjustments made to the vehicle to optimize its behaviour (performance, <a href="Car%20handling">handling</a>, reliability, etc.). Adjustments can occur in <a href="Suspension%20%28vehicle%29">suspensions</a>, brakes, <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">transmissions</a>, engines, tires, and many others.

Aerodynamics and airflow play big roles in the setup of a racecar. Aerodynamic downforce improves the race car’s handling by lowering the center of gravity and distributing the weight of the car equally on each tire. Once this is achieved, fuel consumption decreases and the forces against the car are significantly lowered. Many aerodynamic experiments are conducted in wind tunnels, to simulate real life situations while measuring the various drag forces on the car. These “Rolling roads” produce many wind situations and direct air flow at certain speeds and angles. When a diffuser is installed under the car, the amount of drag force is significantly lowered, and the overall aerodynamics of the vehicle is positively adjusted. Wings and canards channel the airflow in the most efficient way to get the least amount of drag from the car. It is experimentally proven that downforce is gained and the vehicles handling is considerably changed when aerodynamic wings on the front and rear of the vehicle are installed.

Suspension plays a huge part in giving the racecar the ability to be driven optimally. Shocks are mounted vertically or horizontally to prevent the body from rolling in the corners. The suspension is important because it makes the car stable and easier to control and keeps the tires on the road when driving on uneven terrain. It works in three different ways including vertically, longitudinally, and laterally to control movement when racing on various tracks.

Tires called R-Compounds are commonly used in motorsports for high amounts of traction. The soft rubber allows them to expand when they are heated up, making more surface area on the pavement, therefore producing the most amount of traction. These types of tires do not have treads on them. Tire pressure is dependent on the temperature of the tire and track when racing. Each time a driver pulls into the pits, the tire pressure and temperature should be tested for optimal performance. When the tires get too hot they will swell or inflate and need to be deflated to the correct pressure. When the tires are not warmed up they will not perform as well.

Brakes on a race car are imperative in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced, how many laps are being run, track conditions due to weather, and how many caution runs require more braking. There are three variables to consider in racing: brake pedal displacement, brake pedal force, and vehicle deceleration. Various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness, sensitivity, and pedal force of the brakes. When using the brakes effectively, the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase. These phases include attaining maximum deceleration and modulating the brake pressure. Brake performance is measured in bite and consistency. Bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes and they have not warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently. Consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking. These two measurements determine the wear of the brakes.

The race car’s engine needs a considerable amount of air to produce maximum power. The air intake manifold sucks the air from scoops on the hood and front bumper and feeds it into the engine. Many engine modifications to increase horsepower and efficiency are commonly used in many racing sanctioning bodies. Engines are tuned on a machine called a dynamometer that is commonly known in the racing world as a DYNO. The car is driven onto the DYNO and many gauges and sensors are hooked up to the car that are controlled on an online program to test force, torque, or power. Through the testing, the car's engine maps can be changed to get the most amount of horsepower and ultimately speed out of the vehicle.

Racing drivers at the highest levels are usually paid by the team, or by sponsors, and can command very substantial salaries.

Contrary to what may be popularly assumed, racing drivers as a group do not have unusually good reflexes. During countless physiological (and psychological) evaluations of professional racing drivers, the two characteristics that stand out are racers' near-obsessive need to control their surroundings (the psychological aspect), and an unusual ability to process fast-moving information (physiological). In this, researchers have noted a strong correlation between racers' psychological profiles and those of fighter pilots. In tests comparing racers to members of the general public, the greater the complexity of the information processing matrix, the greater the speed gap between racers and the public. Due partly to the performance capabilities of modern racing cars, racing drivers require a high level of fitness, focus and the ability to concentrate at high levels for long periods in an inherently difficult environment. Racing drivers mainly complain about pains in the lumbar, shoulder and neck regions.

In particular, racing cars such as <a href="formula%20racing">formula cars</a> and <a href="sports%20prototype">sports prototype</a>s that generate a substantial amount of <a href="downforce">downforce</a> are able to corner at speeds that impose extremely large <a href="g-force">g-force</a>s on drivers. Formula 1 drivers routinely experience g-loadings in excess of 4.5 g.

Anarcho-capitalism

Anarcho-capitalism is a <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a> and <a href="Anarchist%20schools%20of%20thought">school of anarchist thought</a> that advocates the elimination of the <a href="state%20%28polity%29">state</a> in favor of <a href="self-ownership">self-ownership</a>, <a href="private%20property">private property</a>, and <a href="free%20markets">free markets</a>. Anarcho-capitalists hold that, in the absence of <a href="statute">statute</a> (law by centralized <a href="decree">decree</a>s and <a href="legislation">legislation</a>), society tends to <a href="contract">contractually</a> self-regulate and civilize through the discipline of the free market (in what its proponents describe as a "<a href="voluntary%20society">voluntary society</a>").

In an anarcho-capitalist society, <a href="Police">law enforcement</a>, <a href="court">court</a>s, and all other security services would be operated by <a href="private%20defense%20agency">privately funded competitors</a> rather than centrally through compulsory <a href="taxation">taxation</a>. <a href="Money">Money</a>, along with all other goods and services, would be <a href="free%20banking">privately and competitively provided</a> in an open market. Therefore, personal and <a href="economic">economic</a> activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by victim-based <a href="dispute%20resolution%20organizations">dispute resolution organizations</a> under <a href="tort">tort</a> and <a href="contract">contract</a> law, rather than by statute through centrally determined <a href="punishment">punishment</a> under <a href="politics">political</a> <a href="monopolies">monopolies</a>.

Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. The first person to use the term, however, was <a href="Murray%20Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a>, who in the mid-20th century synthesized elements from the <a href="Austrian%20School">Austrian School of economics</a>, <a href="classical%20liberalism">classical liberalism</a>, and 19th-century American <a href="individualist%20anarchist">individualist anarchist</a>s <a href="Lysander%20Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> (while rejecting their <a href="labor%20theory%20of%20value">labor theory of value</a> and the norms they derived from it). A Rothbardian anarcho-capitalist society would operate under a mutually agreed-upon libertarian "legal code which would be generally accepted, and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow." This pact would recognize self-ownership and the <a href="non-aggression%20principle">non-aggression principle</a> (NAP), although methods of enforcement vary.

Anarcho-capitalists are distinguished from <a href="minarchist">minarchist</a>s, who advocate a small <a href="night-watchman%20state">night-watchman state</a> limited to the function of individual protection, and other anarchists who may seek to prohibit or regulate the accumulation of <a href="property">property</a> and the flow of <a href="Capital%20%28economics%29">capital</a>.

Anarcho-capitalists argue for a society based on the voluntary trade of <a href="private%20property">private property</a> and <a href="Service%20%28economics%29">services</a> (in sum, all relationships not caused by threats or violence, including exchanges of money, consumer goods, land, and capital goods) in order to minimize conflict while maximizing individual liberty and prosperity. However, they also recognize charity and communal arrangements as part of the same voluntary ethic. Though anarcho-capitalists are known for asserting a right to private (individualized or joint non-public) property, some propose that non-state public or community property can also exist in an anarcho-capitalist society. For them, what is important is that it is acquired and transferred without help or hindrance from the compulsory <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a>. Anarcho-capitalist <a href="Libertarianism">libertarians</a> believe that the only just and most economically beneficial way to acquire property is through voluntary trade, gift, or labor-based <a href="homestead%20principle%20%28ethics%29">original appropriation</a>, rather than through aggression or fraud.

Anarcho-capitalists see <a href="free-market">free-market</a> capitalism as the basis for a free and prosperous society. <a href="Murray%20Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> said that the difference between free-market capitalism and "<a href="state%20capitalism">state capitalism</a>" is the difference between "peaceful, voluntary exchange" and a collusive partnership between business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market (Rothbard is credited with coining the term "anarcho-capitalism"). "Capitalism", as anarcho-capitalists employ the term, is not to be confused with <a href="state%20monopoly%20capitalism">state monopoly capitalism</a>, <a href="crony%20capitalism">crony capitalism</a>, <a href="Corporatism%23Fascist%20corporatism">corporatism</a>, or contemporary <a href="mixed%20economies">mixed economies</a>, wherein market incentives and disincentives may be altered by state action. They therefore reject the state, seeing it as an entity which steals property (through taxation and <a href="Confiscation">expropriation</a>), initiates aggression, has a compulsory monopoly on the use of force, uses its coercive powers to benefit some businesses and individuals at the expense of others, creates artificial monopolies, restricts trade, and restricts personal freedoms via <a href="drug%20laws">drug laws</a>, <a href="compulsory%20education">compulsory education</a>, <a href="conscription">conscription</a>, laws on food and morality, and the like.

Many anarchists view capitalism as an inherently <a href="authoritarian">authoritarian</a> and hierarchical system, and seek the expropriation of private property. There is disagreement between these <a href="left%20anarchist">left anarchist</a>s and laissez-faire anarcho-capitalists, as the former generally rejects anarcho-capitalism as a form of anarchism and considers "anarcho-capitalism" an oxymoron, while the latter holds that such expropriation is counterproductive to order, and would require a state. On the <a href="Nolan%20chart">Nolan chart</a>, anarcho-capitalists are located at the extreme edge of the libertarian quadrant – since they reject state involvement in both economic and personal affairs.

Laissez-faire anarchists argue that the state relies on <a href="non-aggression%20principle">initiating force</a> because force can be used against those who have not <a href="theft">stolen private property</a>, <a href="vandalism">vandalized private property</a>, <a href="assault">assaulted anyone</a>, or <a href="fraud">committed fraud</a>. Many also argue that <a href="subsidy">subsidized</a> <a href="monopoly">monopolies</a> tend to be corrupt and inefficient. Anarchist theorist Rothbard argued that all government services, including defense, are inefficient because they lack a market-based <a href="pricing%20mechanism">pricing mechanism</a> regulated by the voluntary decisions of consumers purchasing services that fulfill their highest-priority needs and by investors seeking the most profitable enterprises to invest in. Many anarchists also argue that <a href="private%20defense%20agency">private defense</a> and <a href="dispute%20resolution%20organization">court</a> agencies would have to have a good reputation in order to stay in business. Furthermore, <a href="Linda%20and%20Morris%20Tannehill">Linda and Morris Tannehill</a> argue that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on a truly free market and that a government's citizenry can't desert them in favor of a competent protection and defense agency.

Rothbard bases his philosophy on <a href="natural%20law">natural law</a> grounds and also provides economic explanations of why he thinks anarcho-capitalism is preferable on pragmatic grounds as well. <a href="David%20D.%20Friedman">David D. Friedman</a> says he is not an <a href="moral%20absolutism">absolutist</a> rights theorist but is also "not a <a href="utilitarian">utilitarian</a>", however, he does believe that "utilitarian arguments are usually the best way to defend libertarian views". <a href="Peter%20Leeson">Peter Leeson</a> argues that "the case for anarchy derives its strength from empirical evidence, not theory". <a href="Hans-Hermann%20Hoppe">Hans-Hermann Hoppe</a>, meanwhile, uses "<a href="argumentation%20ethics">argumentation ethics</a>" for his foundation of "private property anarchism", which is closer to Rothbard's natural law approach.

While the Friedmanian formulation of anarcho-capitalism is robust to the presence of violence, and in fact assumes some degree of violence will occur, anarcho-capitalism as formulated by Rothbard and others holds strongly to the central libertarian "nonaggression axiom":

Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a <a href="universal%20ethic">universal ethic</a>, i.e., a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal.

In general, the nonaggression axiom can be said to be a prohibition against the initiation of force, or the threat of force, against persons (i.e., direct violence, assault, murder) or property (i.e., fraud, burglary, theft, taxation). The initiation of force is usually referred to as <a href="aggression">aggression</a> or <a href="coercion">coercion</a>. The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. <a href="Minarchist">Minarchist</a> libertarians, such as most people involved in <a href="List%20of%20libertarian%20political%20parties">libertarian political parties</a>, would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public police, courts and military; others, however, might give further allowance for other government programs. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists reject any level of state intervention, defining the state as a <a href="coercive%20monopoly">coercive monopoly</a> and, as the only entity in human society that derives its income from legal aggression, an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism.

Some anarcho-capitalists, such as Rothbard, accept the nonaggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis. It is in terms of the non-aggression principle that Rothbard defined <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>; he defined "anarchism as a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression ['against person and property']" and said that "what anarchism proposes to do, then, is to abolish the State, i.e. to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion". In an interview published in the libertarian journal "New Banner", Rothbard said that "capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism".

Central to Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism are the concepts of <a href="self-ownership">self-ownership</a> and original appropriation that combines <a href="personal%20property">personal</a> and <a href="private%20property">private property</a>

This is the root of anarcho-capitalist <a href="property%20rights">property rights</a>, and where they differ from <a href="collectivism">collectivist</a> forms of anarchism such as <a href="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a> where the means of production are controlled by the whole community and the product of labor is collectivized in a pool of goods and distributed "according to need" (which is to be determined and enforced collectively). Anarcho-capitalists advocate individual or joint (i.e. "private") ownership of the means of production and the product of labor regardless of what the individual "needs" or does not "need". As Rothbard says: "if every man has the right to own his own body and if he must use and transform material natural objects in order to survive, then he has the right to own the product that he has made." After property is transformed through labor it may then only exchange hands legitimately by trade or gift; forced transfers are considered illegitimate. Original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never-before used resources, including land, and by improving or otherwise using it, own it with the same "absolute right" as his own body. According to Rothbard, property can only come about through labor, therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it; it is only by "using" land – by mixing one's labor with it – that original appropriation is legitimized: "Any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be." Rothbard argues that the resource need not "continue" to be used in order for it to be the person's property, "for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource, it remains his owned land. His labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land, and the land is therefore his or his assigns' in perpetuity." As a practical matter, in terms of the ownership of land, anarcho-capitalists recognize that there are few (if any) parcels of land left on Earth whose ownership was not at some point in time obtained in violation of the homestead principle, through seizure by the state or put in private hands with the assistance of the state. Rothbard says,

Rothbard says in "Justice and Property Right" that "any identifiable owner (the original victim of theft or his heir) must be accorded his property." In the case of slavery, Rothbard says that in many cases "the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified, and the reparations can become highly specific indeed." He believes slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the "homestead principle". If property is held by the state, Rothbard advocates its confiscation and return to the private sector: "any property in the hands of the State is in the hands of thieves, and should be liberated as quickly as possible." For example, he proposes that <a href="State%20university">State universities</a> be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle. Rothbard also supports expropriation of nominally "private property" if it is the result of state-initiated force, such as businesses who receive grants and subsidies. He proposes that businesses who receive at least 50% of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers. He says, "What we libertarians object to, then, is not government per se but crime, what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles; what we are for is not "private" property per se but just, innocent, non-criminal private property." Likewise, Karl Hess says, "libertarianism wants to advance "principles" of property but that it in no way wishes to defend, willy nilly, all property which now is called private... Much of that property is stolen. Much is of dubious title. All of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral, coercive state system." By accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights, anarcho-capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle:

Though anarcho-capitalists assert a right to private property, some anarcho-capitalists also point out that common, i.e. community, property can exist by right in an anarcho-capitalist system. Just as an individual comes to own that which was unowned by mixing his labor with it or using it regularly, a whole community or society can come to own a thing in common by mixing their labor with it collectively, meaning that no individual may appropriate it as his own. This may apply to roads, parks, rivers, and portions of oceans. Anarchist theorist <a href="Roderick%20Long">Roderick Long</a> gives the following example:

Nevertheless, since property that is owned collectively tends to lose the level of accountability found in individual ownership to the extent of the number of owners – and make consensus regarding property use and maintenance decisions proportionately less likely, anarcho-capitalists generally distrust and seek to avoid intentional <a href="communal">communal</a> arrangements. <a href="Privatization">Privatization</a>, <a href="decentralization">decentralization</a>, and individualization are often anarcho-capitalist goals. But in some cases, they not only provide a challenge, but are considered next to impossible. Established ocean routes, for example, are generally seen as unavailable for private appropriation.

Anarcho-capitalists tend to concur with <a href="Free-market%20environmentalism">free-market environmentalists</a> regarding the environmentally destructive tendencies of the state and other communal arrangements. Air, water, and land pollution, for example, are seen as the result of collectivization of ownership. Central governments generally strike down individual or <a href="class%20action">class action</a> censure of polluters in order to benefit "the many", and legal or economic <a href="subsidy">subsidy</a> of <a href="heavy%20industry">heavy industry</a> is justified by many politicians for <a href="job%20creation">job creation</a> within a political territory.

The <a href="Austrian%20school">Austrian school</a> of economics argued against the viability of socialism and centrally planned economic policy. <a href="Eugen%20von%20B%C3%B6hm-Bawerk">Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk</a>, a colleague of Austrian school founder <a href="Carl%20Menger">Carl Menger</a>, wrote one of the first critiques of socialism in his treatise "The Exploitation Theory of Socialism-Communism". Later, <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hayek">Friedrich von Hayek</a> wrote "<a href="The%20Road%20to%20Serfdom">The Road to Serfdom</a>" (1944), which states that a <a href="command%20economy">command economy</a> lacks the information function of market prices, and that central authority over the economy leads to <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>. Another Austrian economist, <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a>, wrote "<a href="Human%20Action">Human Action</a>", an early exposition of the method he called <a href="Praxeology">Praxeology</a>.

Rothbard attempted to meld Austrian economics with classical liberalism and individualist anarchism. He wrote his first paper advocating "private property anarchism" in 1949, and later came up with the alternative name "anarcho-capitalism". He was probably the first to use "libertarian" in its current (U.S.) pro-capitalist sense. His academic training was in economics, but his writings also refer to history and political philosophy. When young, he considered himself part of the <a href="Old%20Right%20%28United%20States%29">Old Right</a>, an anti-statist and anti-<a href="interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionist</a> branch of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican party</a>. In the late 1950s, he was briefly involved with <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, but later had a falling out. When interventionist <a href="cold%20warrior">cold warrior</a>s of the "<a href="National%20Review">National Review</a>", such as <a href="William%20F.%20Buckley%2C%20Jr.">William F. Buckley, Jr.</a>, gained influence in the Republican party in the 1950s, Rothbard quit that group and briefly associated himself with left-wing <a href="antiwar">antiwar</a> groups. He believed that the cold warriors were more indebted in theory to the left and imperialist progressives, especially with respect to <a href="Trotskyist">Trotskyist</a> theory. Rothbard initially opposed the founding of the <a href="Libertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Libertarian Party</a> but joined in 1973 and became one of its leading activists.

The society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the "Contractual Society" – "... a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence." – in which anarcho-capitalists assert the system relies on voluntary agreements (contracts) between individuals as the legal framework. It is difficult to predict precisely what the particulars of this society will look like because of the details and complexities of contracts.

One particular ramification is that transfer of property and services must be considered voluntarily on the part of both parties. No external entities can force an individual to accept or deny a particular transaction. An employer might offer insurance and <a href="Bereavement%20benefit">death benefits</a> to <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex couples</a>; another might refuse to recognize any union outside his or her own faith. Individuals are free to enter into or reject contractual agreements as they see fit.

Rothbard points out that corporations would exist in a free society, as they are simply the pooling of capital. He says limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract: "Corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation..."

Corporations created in this way would not, however, be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non-contractually, such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury, which corporations currently enjoy. Rothbard himself acknowledges that "limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege"

There are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho-capitalism. Rothbard himself argues that the right to contract is based in <a href="inalienable%20rights">inalienable human rights</a> and therefore any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will, which would, for instance, prevent a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured <a href="slavery">slavery</a>. Other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract.

Included in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others. Unlike anarcho-communists, anarcho-capitalists support the liberty of individuals to be self-employed or to contract to be employees of others, whichever they prefer and the freedom to pay and receive wages. Some anarcho-capitalists prefer to see self-employment prevail over wage labor. For example, David Friedman has expressed preference for a society where "almost everyone is self-employed" and "instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade, not authority. Each sells not his time, but what his time produces." Others, such as Rothbard, do not express a preference either way but justify employment as a natural occurrence in a free market that is not immoral in any way.

Different anarcho-capitalists propose different forms of anarcho-capitalism, and one area of disagreement is in the area of law. Morris and Linda Tannehill, in "<a href="The%20Market%20for%20Liberty">The Market for Liberty</a>", object to any <a href="statute">statutory</a> law whatsoever. They argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see <a href="tort">tort</a> and contract law) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong. However, Rothbard, while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud, supports the establishment of a mutually agreed-upon centralized <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> legal code which private courts would pledge to follow.

Unlike both the Tannehills and Rothbard who see an <a href="ideological">ideological</a> commonality of ethics and <a href="morality">morality</a> as a requirement, David Friedman proposes that "the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market, just as books and bras are produced today. There could be competition among different brands of law, just as there is competition among different brands of cars." Friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society "remains to be proven." He says it is a possibility that very unlibertarian laws may result, such as laws against drugs. But, he thinks this would be rare. He reasons that "if the value of a law to its supporters is less than its cost to its victims, that law...will not survive in an anarcho-capitalist society."

Anarcho-capitalists only accept collective defense of individual liberty (i.e., courts, military or police forces) insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis. But, their complaint is not just that the state's defensive services are funded by taxation but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force. That is, it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security, such as a police, judicial, and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors. Anarcho-capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it, but not private individuals, a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors. Also, if competition in security provision were allowed to exist, prices would be lower and services would be better according to anarcho-capitalists. According to Molinari, "Under a regime of liberty, the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries." Proponents point out that private systems of justice and defense "already" exist, naturally forming where the market is allowed to compensate for the failure of the state: private arbitration, security guards, neighborhood watch groups, and so on. These private courts and police are sometimes referred to generically as Private Defense Agencies (PDAs).

The defense of those unable to pay for such protection might be financed by charitable organizations relying on voluntary donation rather than by state institutions relying on coercive taxation, or by cooperative self-help by groups of individuals.

<a href="Subrogation">Subrogation</a>, which allows remuneration for losses and damages to be funded by the aggressors, reduces insurance costs and could operate as a business in itself – converting victims from paying customers into direct beneficiaries. The concept of <a href="Restitution%20Transfer%20and%20Recoupment">Restitution Transfer and Recoupment</a> (RTR) has been explored by freenation theorist John Frederic Kosanke. RTR agencies would employ <a href="performance%20bond">bonding</a> agencies, <a href="private%20investigators">private investigators</a>, private dispute resolution organizations, and private aggressor containment agencies, as required. Instead of having to pay for restitution, victims sell restitution rights to the RTR agencies. This arrangement can be compared to the contractual nature of the Goðorð system employed in the Icelandic Commonwealth by competing chieftains.

Edward Stringham argues that private adjudication of disputes could enable the market to internalize externalities and provide services that customers desire.

Like <a href="classical%20liberalism">classical liberalism</a>, and unlike <a href="anarcho-pacifism">anarcho-pacifism</a>, anarcho-capitalism permits the use of force, as long as it is in the defense of persons or property. The permissible extent of this defensive use of force is an arguable point among anarcho-capitalists. <a href="Retributive%20justice">Retributive justice</a>, meaning retaliatory force, is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho-capitalist society. Some believe prisons or <a href="indentured%20servitude">indentured servitude</a> would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho-capitalist property relations, while others believe <a href="exile">exile</a> or forced <a href="restitution">restitution</a> are sufficient.

<a href="Bruce%20L.%20Benson">Bruce L. Benson</a> argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime. For instance, a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock and is caught before taking anything would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights. Benson opines that, despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases, "standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would, in all likelihood, be established through precedent, allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses." The Tannehills raise a similar example, noting that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees' and customers' lives and safety, in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the teller's call for help. But the robber's loss of reputation would be even more damaging. Specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record. The bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk, and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him.

One difficult application of defensive aggression is the act of revolutionary violence (including <a href="anarcho-capitalist%20revolution">anarcho-capitalist revolution</a>) against tyrannical regimes. Many anarcho-capitalists admire the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> as the legitimate act of individuals working together to fight against <a href="tyranny">tyrannical</a> restrictions of their liberties. In fact, according to Rothbard, the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified. Some anarcho-capitalists, such as <a href="Samuel%20Edward%20Konkin%20III">Samuel Edward Konkin III</a>, feel that violent revolution is counter-productive and prefer voluntary forms of <a href="economic%20secession">economic secession</a> to the extent possible.

The two principal moral approaches to anarcho-capitalism differ in regard to whether anarcho-capitalist society is justified on <a href="deontological">deontological</a> or <a href="consequentialist">consequentialist</a> ethics, or both. Natural-law anarcho-capitalism (as advocated by Rothbard) holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from natural law. Some other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights, but instead present economic justifications for a free-market capitalist society. Such a latter approach has been offered by David D. Friedman in "<a href="The%20Machinery%20of%20Freedom">The Machinery of Freedom</a>". Also unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on "<a href="market%20failure">market failure</a>", but openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions (see "<a href="government%20failure">government failure</a>") to compare the net result. Nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a <a href="Normative%20economics">normative</a> benchmark.

Kosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant since, in the absence of statutory law, the <a href="non-aggression%20principle">non-aggression principle</a> (NAP) is naturally enforced, because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law. Communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to the discipline of the marketplace. For him, the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state, or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form.

Anarchism, in both its <a href="Collectivist%20anarchism">collectivist</a> and <a href="Individualist%20anarchism">individualist</a> forms, is usually considered a <a href="Political%20radicalism">radical</a> <a href="left-wing">left-wing</a> and <a href="anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a> ideology that promotes socialist economic theories such as communism, <a href="syndicalism">syndicalism</a>, and <a href="Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29">mutualism</a>. These anarchists believe capitalism is incompatible with social and economic equality, and therefore do not recognize anarcho-capitalism as an anarchist school of thought. In particular, they argue that capitalist transactions are not voluntary, and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion, which is incompatible with an anarchist society.

Murray Rothbard argues that the capitalist system of today is, indeed, not properly anarchistic because it so often colludes with the state. According to Rothbard, "what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts are what I would call 'free-market capitalism' on the one hand, and 'state capitalism' on the other." "The difference between free-market capitalism and state capitalism," writes Rothbard, "is precisely the difference between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation." He continues, "State capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble."

Rothbard maintains that anarcho-capitalism is the only true form of anarchism – the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality, as, he argues, any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology, such as redistribution of private property. According to this argument, the free market is simply the natural situation that would result from people being free from authority, and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society: cooperatives, non-profit organizations, businesses, etc. Moreover, anarcho-capitalists, as well as classical liberal minarchists, argue that the application of left-wing anarchist ideals would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it. In order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating private capital, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to, in essence, exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people. This body would thus inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state. The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is precisely the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which would be necessary under a coercively egalitarian-anarchist system.

However, Rothbard also wrote a piece, published posthumously, entitled 'Are Libertarians "Anarchists"?' where he traced the etymological roots of Anarchist philosophy, ultimately coming to the conclusion that "...we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position. That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines", and furthermore, "We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive. Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist."

Classical liberalism is the primary influence with the longest history on anarcho-capitalist theory. Classical liberals have had two main themes since <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> first expounded the philosophy: the liberty of man, and limitations of state power. The liberty of man was expressed in terms of <a href="natural%20rights">natural rights</a>, while limiting the state was based (for Locke) on a <a href="consent%20theory">consent theory</a>.

In the 19th century, classical liberals led the attack against statism. One notable was <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Bastiat">Frédéric Bastiat</a> ("<a href="The%20Law%20%281849%20book%29">The Law</a>"), who wrote, "The state is the great fiction by which everybody seeks to live at the expense of everybody else." <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> wrote, "I heartily accept the motto, 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."

The early liberals believed that the state should confine its role to protecting individual liberty and property, and opposed all but the most minimal economic regulations. The "normative core" of classical liberalism is the idea that in an environment of <a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a>, a <a href="spontaneous%20order">spontaneous order</a> of cooperation in exchanging goods and services emerges that satisfies human wants. Some individualists came to realize that the liberal state itself takes property forcefully through taxation in order to fund its protection services, and therefore it seemed logically inconsistent to oppose theft while also supporting a tax-funded protector. So, they advocated what may be seen as classical liberalism taken to the extreme by only supporting voluntarily funded defense by competing private providers. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of privatizing protection of individual liberty and property was France's <a href="Jakob%20Mauvillon">Jakob Mauvillon</a> in the 18th century. Later, in the 1840s, <a href="Julius%20Faucher">Julius Faucher</a> and <a href="Gustave%20de%20Molinari">Gustave de Molinari</a> advocated the same.

Molinari, in his essay "The Production of Security", argued, "No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity." Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian <a href="Ralph%20Raico">Ralph Raico</a> argues that what these liberal philosophers "had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism." Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people – society – and the institutions of force – the State. This "society versus state" idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority, and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few. The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>, as well as in thinkers such as <a href="Paul%20%C3%89mile%20de%20Puydt">Paul Émile de Puydt</a> and <a href="Auberon%20Herbert">Auberon Herbert</a>.

Later, in the early 20th century, the mantle of anti-state liberalism was taken by the Old Right. These were minarchists, anti-war, anti-imperialists, and (later) anti-<a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>ers. Some of the most notable members of the Old Right were <a href="Albert%20Jay%20Nock">Albert Jay Nock</a>, <a href="Rose%20Wilder%20Lane">Rose Wilder Lane</a>, <a href="Isabel%20Paterson">Isabel Paterson</a>, <a href="Frank%20Chodorov">Frank Chodorov</a>, <a href="Garet%20Garrett">Garet Garrett</a>, and <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a>. In the 1950s, the new "fusion conservatism", also called "<a href="cold%20war">cold war</a> conservatism", took hold of the right wing in the U.S., stressing anti-communism. This induced the libertarian Old Right to split off from the right, and seek alliances with the (now left-wing) antiwar movement, and to start specifically libertarian organizations such as the (U.S.) Libertarian Party.

Rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century <a href="Individualist_anarchism_in_the_United_States">American individualist anarchists</a> (who were also influenced by classical liberalism). In the winter of 1949, influenced by several 19th century individualists anarchists, Rothbard decided to reject minimal state laissez-faire and embrace individualist anarchism. Rothbard said in 1965 "<a href="Lysander%20Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20R.%20Tucker">Benjamin R. Tucker</a> were unsurpassed as political philosophers and nothing is more needed today than a revival and development of the largely forgotten legacy they left to political philosophy." However, he thought they had a faulty understanding of economics. The 19th century individualists had a <a href="labor%20theory%20of%20value">labor theory of value</a>, as influenced by the <a href="classical%20economics">classical economists</a>, but Rothbard was a student of <a href="Austrian%20Economics">Austrian Economics</a> which does not agree with the labor theory of value. So, Rothbard sought to meld 19th-century American individualists' advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics: "There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung". Rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.

Rothbard disagreed with this, as he explains in "The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View". He says that first of all Tucker was wrong to think that that would cause the money supply to increase, because he says that the money supply in a free market would be self-regulating. If it were not, then inflation would occur, so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place. Secondly, he says that Tucker is wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless, because people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated. Also, Tucker held a labor theory of value. As a result, he thought that in a free market that people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that if they were not then exploitation or "usury" was taking place. As he explains in "State Socialism and Anarchism", his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses, which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led him to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated, and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay. Again, as an <a href="Austrian%20economist">Austrian economist</a>, Rothbard did not agree with the labor theory. He believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to <a href="marginal%20utility">marginal utility</a> rather than to labor amounts in free market. And he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces.

Of particular importance to anarcho-capitalists and Tucker and Spooner are the ideas of "sovereignty of the individual", a market economy, and the opposition to collectivism. A defining point upon which they agree is that defense of liberty and property should be provided in the free market rather than by the State. Tucker said, "[D]efense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices."

Walter Goldsmidt, after studying the <a href="Yurok%20people">Yurok</a>, <a href="Hupa">Hupa</a>, and <a href="Karuk">Karok</a> Indians and some of their Northern California neighbors, reported "... a culture which reflects in surprising degree certain structural and ethical characteristics of emergent capitalistic Europe". Commenting on this, Bruce Benson writes: In this Indian society, property was universally held in individual private ownership. Socially, these Indians were organized in households and villages. There were no class or other inalienable group affiliations, and no vested authoritarian position-that is no state-like government with coercive power. Private property rights were sharply defined. Title considerations, for example, included (1) separation of title to different types of products; (2) ownership rights within the territory of an alien group (e.g. Hupas owned property inside Yurok territory); and (3) the division of title between persons (e.g., a fishing place could be owned by several people and its use divided so that one person used it one day, another the next, and so on). Ownership was complete and transferable. Exchange was facilitated by a monetary system.

Benson also notes that there was a well-developed system of private arbitration: These Indian tribes nevertheless had a well-developed system of private judging. For instance, if a Yurok wanted to process a legal claim he would hire two, three, or four "crossers" – nonrelatives from a community other than his own. The defendant in the claim would also hire crossers, and the entire group hired by both parties would act as go-betweens, ascertaining claims and defenses and gathering evidence. The crossers would render a judgment for damages after hearing all the evidence. 

Legal scholar Bruce Benson notes: The economy of the Ifugao in Northern Luzon during the early 1900s was dominated by an intensive irrigation hoe culture. Such an economy inevitably requires laws, if for no other reason than to resolve issues over water rights and maintain a complex real-estate system. And the Ifugao developed a very elaborate system of substantive law. Yet the Ifugao had no tribal, district, or village governmental organizations, and no centralized authority with the power to force compliance with the laws or to levy compulsive sanctions on behalf of the society at large. The basic political unit was the family, which had a leader, but not in the sense of a political ruler, as Hoebel notes:"Although he leads the family in legal and economic enterprise, its members think of him more as an integrating core than as a head who in any way dominates." The kinfolk had a mutual duty to support each other in disputes with members of other families. They did not settle these disputes through warfare, but through arbitration by a voluntarily contracted "monkalun". Benson notes: But what happened if the defendant refused to admit his guilt and would not come to terms through the monkalun? Did interfamily warfare break out? The answer to the second question is no because the answer to the first is that such a refusal would be viewed as an insult to the monkalun and align his family against whichever party initiated the violence. This prospect deterred any immediate action by either party even when an impasse was reached.

The Kapauku Papuans were a primitive linguistic group of about 45,000 living by means of horticulture in the western part of the central highlands of West New Guinea until well past the middle of the 20th century. Their culture emphasized individual freedom and there was no common property; almost all property was individually owned, as Pospisil remarks: A house, boat, bow and arrows, field, crops, patches of second-growth forest, or even a meal shared by a family or household is always owned by one person. Individual ownership is so extensive in the Kamu Valley that we find the virgin forests divided into tracts which belong to single individuals. Relatives, husbands and wives do not own anything in common. Even an eleven-year-old boy can own his field and his money and play the role of debtor and creditor as well. 

Benson observes: Their reciprocal arrangements for support and protection were based on kinship, as with the Ifugao. However, members of two or more patrilineages typically joined together for defensive and legal purposes, even though they often belonged to different sibs. These "confederations" often encompassed from three to nine villages, with each village consisting of about fifteen households. The Kapauku had no formal government with coercive power. 

Those who were rich and considered to be honest and generous became leaders called "tonowi". However, they held no coercive authority over others. Legal disputes were handled through contractual arbitration, which was enforced ultimately by the threat of being outlawed and ostracized by all members of one's confederation.

Economist and libertarian scholar <a href="Bryan%20Caplan">Bryan Caplan</a> cites the free cities of medieval Europe as important examples of anarchist or nearly anarchistic societies: One case that has inspired both sorts of anarchists is that of the free cities of medieval Europe. The first weak link in the chain of feudalism, these free cities became Europe's centers of economic development, trade, art, and culture. They provided a haven for runaway serfs, who could often legally gain their freedom if they avoided re-capture for a year and a day. And they offer many examples of how people can form mutual-aid associations for protection, insurance, and community. Of course, left-anarchists and anarcho-capitalists take a somewhat different perspective on the free cities: the former emphasize the communitarian and egalitarian concerns of the free cities, while the latter point to the relatively unregulated nature of their markets and the wide range of services (often including defense, security, and legal services) which were provided privately or semi-privately. 

According to the <a href="libertarianism">libertarian</a> theorist <a href="David%20D.%20Friedman">David D. Friedman</a>, "Medieval Icelandic institutions have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions." While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the legal system of the <a href="Icelandic%20Commonwealth">Icelandic Commonwealth</a> comes close to being a real-world anarcho-capitalist legal system – while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function. "Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially "public" offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system." Commenting on its political structure, libertarian scholar <a href="Roderick%20Long">Roderick Long</a> remarks:The legal system's administration, insofar as it had one, lay in the hands of a parliament of about 40 officers whom historians call, however inadequately, "chieftains." This parliament had no budget and no employees; it met only two weeks per year. In addition to their parliamentary role, chieftains were empowered in their own local districts to appoint judges and to keep the peace; this latter job was handled on an essentially fee-for-service basis. The enforcement of judicial decisions was largely a matter of self-help (hence Iceland's reputation as a land of constant private feuding), but those who lacked the might to enforce their rights could sell their court-decreed claims for compensation to someone more powerful, usually a chieftain; hence even the poor and friendless could not be victimized with impunity. The basis of a chieftain's power within the political order was the power he already possessed outside it, in civil society. The office of chieftaincy was private property, and could be bought or sold; hence chieftaincies tended to track private wealth. But wealth alone was not enough. As economic historian Birgir Solvason notes in his masterful study of the period, "just buying the chieftainship was no guarantee of power"; the mere office by itself was "almost worthless" unless the chieftain could "convince some free-farmers to follow him." Chieftains did not hold authority over territorially-defined districts, but competed for clients with other chieftains from the same geographical area. Long observes how the system of free contract between farmers and chieftains was threatened when harassment from Norwegian kings that began around AD 1000 forced the people of Iceland to accept Christianity as the national religion, which paved the way for the introduction of a compulsory tax in AD 1096 which was to be compulsorily paid to the local chieftain who owned a churchstead. This gave an unfair advantage to some chieftains who, at least in part, did not need to rely upon the voluntary support of their clients in order to receive some income. This gradually lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few big chieftains, enabling them to restrict competition and eventually establish effective monopolies. Although the Commonwealth was politically stable for over three centuries, longer than any democracy has lasted, its eventual down fall was brought about, according to Long, "not through having too much privatization, but through having too little." He notes:[T]he Free State failed, not through having too much privatization, but through having too little. The tithe, and particularly the portion allotted to churchstead maintenance, represented a monopolistic, non-competitive element in the system. The introduction of the tithe was in turn made possible by yet another non-competitive element: the establishment of an official state church which everyone was legally bound to support. Finally, buying up chieftaincies would have availed little if there had been free entry into the chieftaincy profession; instead, the number of chieftains was set by law, and the creation of new chieftaincies could be approved only by parliament – i.e., by the existing chieftains, who were naturally less than eager to encourage competitors. It is precisely those respects in which the Free State was least privatized and decentralized that led to its downfall – while its more privatized aspects delayed that downfall for three centuries.

According to the research of <a href="Terry%20L.%20Anderson">Terry L. Anderson</a> and P. J. Hill, the <a href="Old%20West">Old West</a> in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that "private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved," and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect. Since <a href="squatter">squatter</a>s had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:

According to Anderson, "Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced."

<a href="Murray%20Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> in his work "<a href="For%20a%20New%20Liberty">For a New Liberty</a>" has claimed ancient <a href="Gaelic%20Ireland">Gaelic Ireland</a> as an example of nearly anarcho-capitalist society. In his depiction, citing the work of Professor Joseph Peden, the basic political unit of ancient Ireland was the tuath, which is portrayed as "a body of persons voluntarily united for socially beneficial purposes" with its territorial claim being limited to "the sum total of the landed properties of its members". Civil disputes were settled by private arbiters called "brehons", and the compensation to be paid to the wronged party was insured through voluntary surety relationships. Commenting on the "kings" of tuaths, Rothbard states:The king was elected by the tuath from within a royal kin-group (the
derbfine), which carried the hereditary priestly function. Politically, however, the king had strictly limited functions: he was the military leader of the tuath, and he presided over the tuath assemblies. But he could only conduct war or peace negotiations as agent of the assemblies; and he was in no sense sovereign and had no rights of administering justice over tuath members. He could not legislate, and when he himself was party to a lawsuit, he had to submit his case to an independent judicial arbiter.

Many libertarian historians have cited <a href="law%20merchant">law merchant</a>, <a href="admiralty%20law">admiralty law</a> and early <a href="common%20law">common law</a> as examples of anarcho-capitalism. In his work, "Power and Market", Rothbard states:
The law merchant, admiralty law, and much of the common law began to be developed by privately competitive judges, who were sought out by litigants for their expertise in understanding the legal areas involved. The fairs of Champagne and the great marts of international trade in the Middle Ages enjoyed freely competitive courts, and people could patronize those that they deemed most accurate and efficient.

Commenting on <a href="Law%20Merchant">Law Merchant</a>, the Britannica Encyclopedia states:

Regarding common law, David Friedman notes:
The common law had its origin in the legal system of Anglo-Saxon England, whose early form involved a large element of private enforcement and private arbitration. It evolved in an environment of multiple court systems – church, royal, and local – where litigants had at least some control over where their disputes were resolved. Some common law rules originated as private norms, and I have argued that norms are produced on something like a competitive market. Some rules may have been borrowed from the medieval Fair Courts, which had some of the characteristics of the system I have described.

Commenting on the evolution of British common law, the classical liberal economist <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a> noted in his treatise "The Wealth of Nations": The fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of the different courts of justice in England. Each court endeavoured to draw to itself as much business as it could, and was, upon that account, willing to take cognisance of many suits which were not originally intended to fall under its jurisdiction. The court of king's bench, instituted for the trial of criminal causes only, took cognisance of civil suits; the plaintiff pretending that the defendant, in not doing him justice, had been guilty of some trespass or misdemeanour. The court of exchequer, instituted for the levying of the king's revenue, and for enforcing the payment of such debts only as were due to the king, took cognisance of all other contract debts; the plaintiff alleging that he could not pay the king because the defendant would not pay him. In consequence of such fictions it came, in many cases, to depend altogether upon the parties before what court they would choose to have their cause tried; and each court endeavoured, by superior dispatch and impartiality, to draw to itself as many causes as it could. The present admirable constitution of the courts of justice in England was, perhaps, originally in a great measure formed by this emulation which anciently took place between their respective judges; each judge endeavouring to give, in his own court, the speediest and most effectual remedy which the law would admit for every sort of injustice.

<a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>, from 1991 to 2006, is cited as a real-world example of a <a href="stateless%20society">stateless society</a> and legal system. Since the fall of <a href="Siad%20Barre">Siad Barre</a>'s government in January 1991, there had been no central government in Somalia until the establishment of the <a href="Transitional%20National%20Government">Transitional National Government</a> and its successor the <a href="Transitional%20Federal%20Government">Transitional Federal Government</a>. While some urban areas such as Mogadishu had private police forces, many Somalis simply returned to the traditional <a href="Somali%20people%23Clan%20and%20family%20structure">clan</a>-based legal structures for local governance and dispute resolution. Anthropologist <a href="Spencer%20MacCallum">Spencer MacCallum</a> has identified the <a href="rule%20of%20law">rule of law</a> during the period as that of the <a href="Xeer">Xeer</a>, a customary law indigenous to Somalia. The law permits practices such as safe travel, trade, and marriage, which survives "to a significant degree" throughout Somalia, particularly in rural Somalia where it is "virtually unaffected".
MacCallum credits the Xeer with "Somalia's success without a central government, since it provides an authentic rule of law to support trade and economic development." In the Xeer, law and crime are defined in terms of <a href="property%20rights">property rights</a>; consequently the <a href="criminal%20justice">criminal justice</a> system is <a href="Damages">compensatory</a> rather than the <a href="Prison">punitive</a> system of the majority of <a href="Sovereign%20state">states</a>, and the Xeer is "unequivocal in its opposition" to any form of <a href="taxation">taxation</a>. Powell et al. (2006) find that the existence of the common law <a href="dispute%20resolution">dispute resolution</a> system in Somalia makes possible basic economic order. MacCallum compares the Xeer to the <a href="common%20law">common law</a> in 6th century Scotland, and notes that there is no monopoly of either <a href="police">police</a> nor <a href="judiciary">judicial services</a>, a condition of <a href="polycentric%20law">polycentric law</a>.

Nonetheless, many anarcho-capitalists argue that Somalia was not an anarchist society.

<a href="Benjamin%20Powell">Benjamin Powell</a> argued that statelessness led to more order and less chaos than had the previous state under central government, and economist <a href="Alex%20Tabarrok">Alex Tabarrok</a> claimed that Somalia in its stateless period provided a "unique test of the theory of <a href="anarchy">anarchy</a>", in some aspects near of that espoused by anarcho-capitalists <a href="David%20D.%20Friedman">David D. Friedman</a> and <a href="Murray%20Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a>.

Some critics argue that anarcho-capitalism turns <a href="justice">justice</a> into a commodity; private defense and court firms would favour those who pay more for their services. <a href="Randall%20G.%20Holcombe">Randall G. Holcombe</a> argues that defense agencies could form cartels and oppress people without fear of competition. Philosopher <a href="Albert%20Meltzer">Albert Meltzer</a> argued that since anarcho-capitalism promotes the idea of private armies, it actually supports a "limited State." He contends that it "is only possible to conceive of Anarchism which is free, communistic and offering no economic necessity for repression of countering it."

<a href="Robert%20Nozick">Robert Nozick</a> argues in "<a href="Anarchy%2C%20State%2C%20and%20Utopia">Anarchy, State, and Utopia</a>" that an anarcho-capitalist society would inevitably transform into a <a href="night%20watchman%20state">minarchist state</a> through the eventual emergence of a monopolistic private defense and judicial agency that no longer faces competition. He argues that anarcho-capitalism results in an unstable system that would not endure in the real world. Paul Birch argues that legal disputes involving several jurisdictions and different legal systems will be too complex and costly. Thus, the largest private protection business in a territory will develop into a <a href="natural%20monopoly">natural monopoly</a>.

Anarcho-capitalists counter that this argument is circular, because monopolies are artificial constructs that can only be maintained by political immunity to natural market processes, or by perpetual provision of superior quality products and services. Unless competitors are prevented from entering a market, the profit incentive, which is fueled by constant demand for improvement, proportionately draws them into it. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the medieval systems in Ireland and Iceland, treating the right to justice as a property means that it is sold – not purchased – by victims.

Many anarcho-capitalists believe that <a href="negative%20rights">negative rights</a> should be recognized as legitimate but <a href="positive%20rights">positive rights</a> should be rejected. Some critics, including <a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, reject the distinction between positive and negative rights.

Chomsky said, "Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history. There isn't the slightest possibility that its (in my view, horrendous) ideas would be implemented, because they would quickly destroy any society that made this colossal error. The idea of "free contract" between the potentate and his starving subject is a sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic seminar exploring the consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but nowhere else".

Most anarchists argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary, and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion, which violates anarchist principles. <a href="David%20Graeber">David Graeber</a> noted his skepticism about anarcho-capitalism along the same lines:

Some critics argue that the anarcho-capitalist concept of voluntary choice ignores constraints due to both human and non-human factors, such as the need for food and shelter, and active restriction of both used and unused resources by those enforcing property claims. Thus, if a person requires employment in order to feed and house himself, the employer–employee relationship could be considered involuntary. Another criticism is that employment is involuntary because the economic system that makes it necessary for some individuals to serve others is supported by the enforcement of coercive private property relations.

Some philosophies view any ownership claims on land and natural resources as immoral and illegitimate.

Some libertarian critics of anarcho-capitalism who support the full privatization of capital, such as <a href="geolibertarianism">geolibertarians</a>, argue that <a href="land%20%28economics%29">land</a> and the raw materials of nature remain a distinct <a href="factors%20of%20production">factor of production</a> and cannot be justly converted to private property because they are not products of human labor. Some <a href="socialism">socialists</a>, including other market anarchists such as <a href="mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29">mutualists</a>, adamantly oppose absentee ownership. Anarcho-capitalists have strong abandonment criteria – one maintains ownership (more or less) until one agrees to trade or gift it. Anti-state critics of this view tend to have comparatively weak abandonment criteria; for example, one loses ownership (more or less) when one stops personally occupying and using it. Also, the idea of perpetually binding original appropriation is anathema to socialism and traditional schools of anarchism, as well as to any moral or economic philosophy that takes equal natural rights to land and the earth's resources as a premise.

Anarcho-capitalists counter that property is not only natural, but unavoidable, citing the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> as an inevitable result of its prohibition and collectivization, which they claim eliminates the incentives and accountability of ownership and <a href="Black%20market">blackens markets</a>. Kosanke further challenges what he perceives as egalitarian dogma by attempting to demonstratrate that all costs of living are naturally determined, subject to a variety of factors, and can not be politically manipulated without net negative consequences.

The following is a partial list of notable nonfiction works discussing anarcho-capitalism.

Anarcho-capitalism has been examined in certain works of literature, particularly science fiction. An early example is <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s 1966 novel "<a href="The%20Moon%20Is%20a%20Harsh%20Mistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a>", in which he explores what he terms "rational anarchism".

<a href="Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</a> and <a href="postcyberpunk">postcyberpunk</a> authors have been particularly fascinated by the idea of the breakdown of the nation-state. Several stories of <a href="Vernor%20Vinge">Vernor Vinge</a>, including "<a href="Marooned%20in%20Realtime">Marooned in Realtime</a>" and "<a href="The%20Collected%20Stories%20of%20Vernor%20Vinge%23Conquest%20by%20Default">Conquest by Default</a>", feature anarcho-capitalist societies, sometimes portrayed in a favorable light, and sometimes not. <a href="Neal%20Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>'s "<a href="Snow%20Crash">Snow Crash</a>" and "<a href="The%20Diamond%20Age">The Diamond Age</a>", <a href="Max%20Barry">Max Barry</a>'s "<a href="Jennifer%20Government">Jennifer Government</a>" and <a href="L.%20Neil%20Smith">L. Neil Smith</a>'s "<a href="The%20Probability%20Broach">The Probability Broach</a>" all explore anarcho-capitalist ideas. The cyberpunk portrayal of anarchy varies from the downright grim to the cheerfully optimistic, and it need not imply anything specific about the writer's political views. Neal Stephenson, in particular, refrains from sweeping political statements when deliberately provoked.

In Matt Stone's (Richard D. Fuerle) novelette "On the Steppes of Central Asia" an American grad student is invited to work for a newspaper in Mongolia, and discovers that the Mongolian society is indeed stateless in a semi-anarcho-capitalist way. The novelette was originally written to advertise Fuerle's 1986 economics treatise "The Pure Logic of Choice".

"Sharper Security: A Sovereign Security Company Novel", part of a series by Thomas Sewell, is "set a couple of decades into the near-future with a liberty view of society based on individual choice and free market economics" and features a society where individuals hire a security company to protect and insure them from crime. The security companies are sovereign, but customers are free to switch between them. They behave as a combination of insurance/underwriting and para-military police forces. Anarcho-capitalist themes abound, including an exploration of not honoring sovereign immunity, privately owned road systems, a laissez faire market and competing currencies.

<a href="Sandy%20Sandfort">Sandy Sandfort</a>'s, <a href="Scott%20Bieser">Scott Bieser</a>'s and <a href="Lee%20Oaks">Lee Oaks</a>'s Webcomic "<a href="Escape%20from%20Terra">Escape from Terra</a>", examines a market anarchy based on Ceres
and its interaction with the aggressive statist society on Terra.

Aristophanes

Aristophanes ( or ; , ; c. 446 – c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the <a href="deme">deme</a> <a href="Kydathenaion">Kydathenaion</a> (), was a <a href="comedy">comic</a> <a href="playwright">playwright</a> of <a href="Classical%20Athens">ancient Athens</a>. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20comedy">Old Comedy</a>, and are used to define it.

Also known as "the Father of Comedy" and "the Prince of Ancient Comedy", Aristophanes has been said to recreate the life of ancient Athens more convincingly than any other author. His powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries; <a href="Plato">Plato</a> singled out Aristophanes' play "<a href="The%20Clouds">The Clouds</a>" as <a href="slander">slander</a> that contributed to the trial and subsequent condemning to death of <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a> although other <a href="Socrates%23Satirical%20playwrights">satirical playwrights</a> had also caricatured the philosopher.

His second play, "The Babylonians" (now lost), was denounced by the demagogue <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a> as a slander against the Athenian <a href="polis">polis</a>. It is possible that the case was argued in court but details of the trial are not recorded and Aristophanes caricatured Cleon mercilessly in his subsequent plays, especially "<a href="The%20Knights">The Knights</a>", the first of many plays that he directed himself. "In my opinion," he says through the Chorus in that play, "the author-director of comedies has the hardest job of all." ()

Less is known about Aristophanes than about his plays. In fact, his plays are the main source of information about him and his life. It was conventional in <a href="Old%20Comedy">Old Comedy</a> for the <a href="Greek%20chorus">Chorus</a> to speak on behalf of the author during an address called the '<a href="Aristophanes%23Parabasis">parabasis</a>' and thus some biographical facts can be found there. However, these facts relate almost entirely to his career as a dramatist and the plays contain few clear and unambiguous clues about his personal beliefs or his private life. He was a comic "poet" in an age when it was conventional for a poet to assume the role of 'teacher' (<a href="Theatre%20director%23The%20director%20in%20theatre%20history">didaskalos</a>), and though this specifically referred to his training of the Chorus in rehearsal, it also covered his relationship with the audience as a commentator on significant issues.

Aristophanes claimed to be writing for a clever and discerning audience, yet he also declared that 'other times' would judge the audience according to its reception of his plays. He sometimes boasts of his originality as a dramatist yet his plays consistently espouse opposition to radical new influences in Athenian society. He caricatured leading figures in the arts (notably <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>, whose influence on his own work however he once begrudgingly acknowledged), in politics (especially the populist <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a>), and in philosophy/religion (where Socrates was the most obvious target). Such caricatures seem to imply that Aristophanes was an old-fashioned conservative, yet that view of him leads to contradictions.

It has been argued that Aristophanes produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitions. His plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of Athens, the <a href="Lenaia">Lenaia</a> and <a href="City%20Dionysia">City Dionysia</a>, where they were judged and awarded prizes in competition with the works of other comic dramatists. An elaborate series of lotteries, designed to prevent prejudice and corruption, reduced the voting judges at the City Dionysia to just five in number. These judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences. The theatres were certainly huge, with seating for at least 10 000 at the Theatre of Dionysus. The day's program at the City Dionysia for example was crowded, with three tragedies and a '<a href="satyr">satyr</a>' play ahead of a comedy, but it is possible that many of the poorer citizens (typically the main supporters of <a href="demagogues">demagogues</a> like Cleon) occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits. The conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of the dominant group in an unrepresentative audience.

The production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays. Throughout most of Aristophanes' career, the Chorus was essential to a play's success and it was recruited and funded by a "<a href="choregus">choregus</a>", a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the <a href="archon">archon</a>s. A choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the Chorus as a civic duty and a public honour, but Aristophanes showed in "<a href="The%20Knights">The Knights</a>" that wealthy citizens might regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like Cleon. Thus the political conservatism of the plays may reflect the views of the wealthiest section of Athenian society, on whose generosity all dramatists depended for putting on their plays.

When Aristophanes' first play "The Banqueters" was produced, Athens was an ambitious, imperial power and the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> was only in its fourth year. His plays often express pride in the achievement of the older generation (the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars%23Battle%20of%20Marathon">victors at Marathon</a>) yet they are not jingoistic, and they are staunchly opposed to the war with Sparta. The plays are particularly scathing in criticism of war profiteers, among whom populists such as Cleon figure prominently. By the time his last play was produced (around 386 BC) Athens had been defeated in war, its empire had been dismantled and it had undergone a transformation from being the political to the intellectual centre of Greece. Aristophanes was part of this transformation and he shared in the intellectual fashions of the period — the structure of his plays evolves from Old Comedy until, in his last surviving play, "<a href="Plutus%20%28play%29">Wealth II</a>", it more closely resembles <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20comedy%23New%20Comedy%20%28nea%29">New Comedy</a>. However it is uncertain whether he led or merely responded to changes in audience expectations.

Aristophanes won second prize at the <a href="City%20Dionysia">City Dionysia</a> in 427 BC with his first play "The Banqueters" (now lost). He won first prize there with his next play, "The Babylonians" (also now lost). It was usual for foreign dignitaries to attend the City Dionysia, and "The Babylonians" caused some embarrassment for the Athenian authorities since it depicted the cities of the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a> as slaves grinding at a mill. Some influential citizens, notably <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a>, reviled the play as slander against the "<a href="polis">polis</a>" and possibly took legal action against the author. The details of the trial are unrecorded but, speaking through the hero of his third play "<a href="The%20Acharnians">The Acharnians</a>" (staged at the <a href="Lenaia">Lenaia</a>, where there were few or no foreign dignitaries), the poet carefully distinguishes between the "polis" and the real targets of his acerbic wit:
Aristophanes repeatedly savages Cleon in his later plays. But these satirical diatribes appear to have had no effect on Cleon's political career — a few weeks after the performance of "The Knights" - a play full of anti-Cleon jokes - Cleon was elected to the prestigious board of ten generals. Cleon also seems to have had no real power to limit or control Aristophanes: the caricatures of him continued up to and even beyond his death.

In the absence of clear biographical facts about Aristophanes, scholars make educated guesses based on interpretation of the language in the plays. <a href="Inscriptiones%20Graecae">Inscriptions</a> and summaries or comments by Hellenistic and Byzantine scholars can also provide useful clues. We know however from a combination of these sources, and especially from comments in "The Knights" and "The Clouds", that Aristophanes' first three plays were not directed by him — they were instead directed by Callistratus and Philoneides, an arrangement that seemed to suit Aristophanes since he appears to have used these same directors in many later plays as well (Philoneides for example later directed "The Frogs" and he was also credited, perhaps wrongly, with directing "The Wasps".) Aristophanes's use of directors complicates our reliance on the plays as sources of biographical information because apparent self-references might have been made with reference to his directors instead. Thus for example a statement by the chorus in "The Acharnians" seems to indicate that the 'poet' had a close, personal association with the island of <a href="Aegina">Aegina</a>, yet the terms 'poet' ("poietes") and 'director' ("didaskalos") are often interchangeable as dramatic poets usually directed their own plays and therefore the reference in the play could be either to Aristophanes or Callistratus. Similarly, the hero in "The Acharnians" complains about Cleon "dragging me into court" over "last year's play" but here again it is not clear if this was said in reference to Aristophanes or Callistratus, either of whom might have been prosecuted by Cleon.

Comments made by the Chorus referring to Aristophanes in "<a href="The%20Clouds">The Clouds</a>" have been interpreted as evidence that he can hardly have been more than 18 years old when his first play "The Banqueters" was produced. The second parabasis in "Wasps" appears to indicate that he reached some kind of temporary accommodation with Cleon following either the controversy over "The Babylonians" or a subsequent controversy over "The Knights". It has been inferred from statements in "The Clouds" and "<a href="Peace%20%28play%29">Peace</a>" that Aristophanes was prematurely bald.

We know that Aristophanes was probably victorious at least once at the City Dionysia (with "Babylonians" in 427) and at least three times at the Lenaia, with "Acharnians" in 425, "Knights" in 424, and "Frogs" in 405. "Frogs" in fact won the unique distinction of a repeat performance at a subsequent festival. We know that a son of Aristophanes, Araros, was also a comic poet and he could have been heavily involved in the production of his father's play "<a href="Plutus%20%28play%29">Wealth II</a>" in 388. Araros is also thought to have been responsible for the posthumous performances of the now lost plays "Aeolosicon II" and "Cocalus", and it is possible that the last of these won the prize at the City Dionysia in 387. It appears that a second son, Philippus, was twice victorious at the Lenaia and he could have directed some of <a href="Eubulus%20%28poet%29">Eubulus</a>’ comedies. A third son was called either Nicostratus or Philetaerus, and a man by the latter name appears in the catalogue of Lenaia victors with two victories, the first probably in the late 370s.

Plato's "<a href="The%20Symposium">The Symposium</a>" appears to be a useful source of biographical information about Aristophanes, but its reliability is open to doubt. It purports to be a record of conversations at a dinner party at which both Aristophanes and Socrates are guests, held some seven years after the performance of "The Clouds", the play in which Socrates was cruelly caricatured. One of the guests, <a href="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>, even quotes from the play when teasing Socrates over his appearance and yet there is no indication of any ill-feeling between Socrates and Aristophanes. Plato's Aristophanes is in fact a genial character and this has been interpreted as evidence of Plato's own friendship with him (their friendship appears to be corroborated by an epitaph for Aristophanes, "reputedly" written by Plato, in which the playwright's soul is compared to an eternal shrine for the <a href="Graces">Graces</a>). Plato was only a boy when the events in "The Symposium" are supposed to have occurred and it is possible that his Aristophanes is in fact based on a reading of the plays. For example, conversation among the guests turns to the subject of Love and Aristophanes explains his notion of it in terms of an amusing allegory, a device he often uses in his plays. He is represented as suffering an attack of <a href="hiccoughs">hiccoughs</a> and this might be a humorous reference to the crude physical jokes in his plays. He tells the other guests that he is quite happy to be thought amusing but he is wary of appearing ridiculous. This fear of being ridiculed is consistent with his declaration in "The Knights" that he embarked on the career of comic playwright warily after witnessing the public contempt and ridicule that other dramatists had incurred.

Aristophanes survived <a href="The%20Peloponnesian%20War">The Peloponnesian War</a>, two oligarchic revolutions and two democratic restorations; this has been interpreted as evidence that he was not actively involved in politics despite his highly political plays. He was probably appointed to the <a href="Boule%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">Council of Five Hundred</a> for a year at the beginning of the fourth century but such appointments were very common in <a href="Athenian%20democracy">democratic Athens</a>. Socrates, in the trial leading up to his own death, put the issue of a personal conscience in those troubled times quite succinctly:

The language of Aristophanes' plays, and in Old Comedy generally, was valued by ancient commentators as a model of the <a href="Attic%20Greek">Attic dialect</a>. The orator <a href="Quintilian">Quintilian</a> believed that the charm and grandeur of the Attic dialect made Old Comedy an example for orators to study and follow, and he considered it inferior in these respects only to the works of Homer. A revival of interest in the Attic dialect may have been responsible for the recovery and circulation of Aristophanes' plays during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, resulting in their survival today. In Aristophanes' plays, the Attic dialect is couched in verse and his plays can be appreciated for their poetic qualities.

For Aristophanes' contemporaries the works of <a href="Homer">Homer</a> and <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> formed the cornerstones of Hellenic history and culture. Thus poetry had a moral and social significance that made it an inevitable topic of comic satire. Aristophanes was very conscious of literary fashions and traditions and his plays feature numerous references to other poets. These include not only rival comic dramatists such as <a href="Eupolis">Eupolis</a> and <a href="Hermippus">Hermippus</a> and predecessors such as <a href="Magnes%20%28comic%20poet%29">Magnes</a>, <a href="Crates%20%28comic%20poet%29">Crates</a> and <a href="Cratinus">Cratinus</a>, but also tragedians, notably <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> and <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>, all three of whom are mentioned in e.g. "The Frogs". Aristophanes was the equal of these great tragedians in his subtle use of lyrics. He appears to have modelled his approach to language on that of Euripides in particular, so much so that the comic dramatist <a href="Cratinus">Cratinus</a> labelled him a 'Euripidaristophanist' addicted to hair-splitting niceties.

A full appreciation of Aristophanes' plays requires an understanding of the poetic forms he employed with virtuoso skill, and of their different rhythms and associations. There were three broad poetic forms: iambic dialogue, tetrameter verses and lyrics:



The rhythm begins at a typical anapestic gallop, slows down to consider the revered poets Hesiod and Homer, then gallops off again to its comic conclusion at the expense of the unfortunate Pantocles. Such subtle variations in rhythm are common in the plays, allowing for serious points to be made while still whetting the audience's appetite for the next joke.

<poem style="margin-left:2em">
Though to myself I often seem
None comes close to Amynias,
Clan, a man I once saw
Now as poor as Antiphon,
Yet he got himself appointed
Way up there in <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>,
Happy to be where everyone

It can be argued that the most important feature of the language of the plays is imagery, particularly the use of similes, metaphors and pictorial expressions. In 'The Knights', for example, the ears of a character with selective hearing are represented as parasols that open and close. In "The Frogs", <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> is said to compose verses in the manner of a horse rolling in a sandpit. Some plays feature revelations of human perfectibility that are poetic rather than religious in character, such as the marriage of the hero Pisthetairos to <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>'s paramour in "The Birds" and the 'recreation' of old Athens, crowned with roses, at the end of "The Knights".

It is widely believed that Aristophanes condemned rhetoric on both moral and political grounds. He states, “a speaker trained in the new rhetoric may use his talents to deceive the jury and bewilder his opponents so thoroughly that the trial loses all semblance of fairness”
. He is speaking to the “art” of flattery, and evidence points towards the fact that many of Aristophanes’ plays were actually created with the intent to attack the view of rhetoric. The most noticeable attack can be seen in his play Banqueters, in which two brothers from different educational backgrounds argue over which education is better. One brother comes from a background of “old-fashioned” education while the other brother appears to be a product of the sophistic education 
The chorus was mainly used by Aristophanes as a defense against rhetoric and would often talk about topics such as the civic duty of those who were educated in classical teachings. In Aristophanes’ opinion it was the job of those educated adults to protect the public from the deception and to stand as a beacon of light for those who were more gullible than others. One of the main reasons why Aristophanes was so against the sophists came into existence from the requirements listed by the leaders of the organization. Money was essential, which meant that roughly all of the pupils studying with the sophists came from upper-class backgrounds and excluded the rest of the polis. Aristophanes believed that education and knowledge was a public service and that anything that excluded willing minds was nothing but an abomination. He concludes that all politicians that study rhetoric must have "doubtful citizenships, unspeakable morals, and too much arrogance”

The Greek word for comedy ("kōmōidía") derives from the words for 'revel' and 'song' ("kōmos" and "ōdē") and according to Aristotle comic drama actually developed from song. The first official comedy at the <a href="City%20Dionysia">City Dionysia</a> was not staged until 487/6 BC, by which time tragedy had already been long established there. The first comedy at the <a href="Lenaia">Lenaia</a> was staged later still, only about 20 years before the performance there of "The Acharnians", the first of Aristophanes' surviving plays. According to Aristotle, comedy was slow to gain official acceptance because nobody took it seriously, yet only sixty years after comedy first appeared at the City Dionysia, Aristophanes observed that producing comedies was the most difficult work of all. Competition at the Dionysian festivals needed dramatic conventions for plays to be judged, but it also fuelled innovations. Developments were quite rapid and Aristotle could distinguish between 'old' and 'new' comedy by 330 BC.

The trend from Old Comedy to New Comedy saw a move away from highly topical concerns with real individuals and local issues towards generalized situations and stock characters. This was partly due to the internationalization of cultural perspectives during and after the Peloponnesian War. For ancient commentators such as Plutarch, New Comedy was a more sophisticated form of drama than Old Comedy. However, Old Comedy was in fact a complex and sophisticated dramatic form incorporating many approaches to humour and entertainment. In Aristophanes' early plays, the genre appears to have developed around a complex set of dramatic conventions, and these were only gradually simplified and abandoned.

The City Dionysia and the Lenaia were celebrated in honour of Dionysus, the god of wine and ecstasy. (<a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>' play "<a href="The%20Bacchae">The Bacchae</a>" offers the best insight into 5th century ideas about this god.) Old Comedy can be understood as a celebration of the exuberant sense of release inherent in his worship It was more interested in finding targets for satire than in any kind of advocacy. During the City Dionysia, a statue of the god was brought to the theatre from a temple outside the city, and it remained in the theatre throughout the festival, overseeing the plays like a privileged member of the audience. In "The Frogs", the god appears also as a dramatic character, and he enters the theatre ludicrously disguised as <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a>. He observes to the audience that every time he is on hand to hear a joke from a comic dramatist like Phrynichus (one of Aristophanes' rivals) he ages by more than a year. This scene opens the play, and it is a reminder to the audience that nobody is above mockery in Old Comedy — not even its patron god and its practitioners. Gods, artists, politicians and ordinary citizens were legitimate targets, comedy was a kind of licensed buffoonery, and there was no legal redress for anyone who was slandered in a play. There were certain limits to the scope of the satire, but they are not easily defined. Impiety could be punished in 5th century Athens, but the absurdities implicit in the traditional religion were open to ridicule. The <a href="polis">polis</a> was not allowed to be slandered, but as stated in the biography section of this article, that could depend on who was in the audience and which festival was involved.

For convenience, Old Comedy, as represented by Aristophanes' early plays, is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristics — topicality, festivity and complexity. Dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of Aristophanes' plays. However, it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to English translations and it is therefore treated in a separate section.

Old Comedy's emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentaries — see for example articles on "<a href="The%20Knights">The Knights</a>", "<a href="The%20Wasps">The Wasps</a>" and "<a href="Peace%20%28play%29">Peace</a>" for lists of topical references. The topicality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient Athens.


The Lenaia and City Dionysia were religious festivals, but they resembled a gala rather than a church service.


The development of New Comedy involved a trend towards more realistic plots, a simpler dramatic structure and a softer tone. Old Comedy was the comedy of a vigorously democratic polis at the height of its power and it gave Aristophanes the freedom to explore the limits of humour, even to the point of undermining the humour itself.


The structural elements of a typical Aristophanic plot can be summarized as follows:
The rules of competition did not prevent a playwright arranging and adjusting these elements to suit his particular needs. In "The Acharnians" and "Peace", for example, there is no formal agon whereas in "The Clouds" there are two agons.

The parabasis is an address to the audience by the chorus or chorus leader while the actors leave or have left the stage. In this role, the chorus is sometimes out of character, as the author's voice, and sometimes in character, although these capacities are often difficult to distinguish. Generally the parabasis occurs somewhere in the middle of a play and often there is a second parabasis towards the end. The elements of a parabasis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that Aristophanes' own understanding was less formal. The selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second parabasis. The early plays ("The Acharnians" to "The Birds") are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within them.

"<a href="The%20Wasps">The Wasps</a>" is thought to offer the best example of a conventional approach and the elements of a parabasis can be identified and located in that play as follows.

Textual corruption is probably the reason for the absence of the antistrophe in the second parabasis.
However, there are several variations from the ideal even within the early plays. For example, the parabasis proper in "The Clouds" (lines 518-62) is composed in eupolidean meter rather than in anapests and the second parabasis includes a kommation but it lacks strophe, antistrophe and antepirrhema ("The Clouds" lines 1113-30). The second parabasis in "The Acharnians" lines 971-99 can be considered a hybrid parabasis/song (i.e. the declaimed sections are merely continuations of the strophe and antistrophe) and, unlike the typical parabasis, it seems to comment on actions that occur on stage during the address. An understanding of Old Comedy conventions such as the parabasis is necessary for a proper understanding of Aristophanes' plays; on the other hand, a sensitive appreciation of the plays is necessary for a proper understanding of the conventions.

The tragic dramatists, <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> and <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>, died near the end of the Peloponnesian War and the art of tragedy thereafter ceased to develop, yet comedy did continue to evolve after the defeat of Athens and it is possible that it did so because, in Aristophanes, it had a master craftsman who lived long enough to help usher it into a new age. Indeed, according to one ancient source (Platonius, c.9th Century AD), one of Aristophanes's last plays, "Aioliskon", had neither a parabasis nor any choral lyrics (making it a type of Middle Comedy), while "Kolakos" anticipated all the elements of New Comedy, including a rape and a recognition scene. Aristophanes seems to have had some appreciation of his formative role in the development of comedy, as indicated by his comment in "Clouds" that his audience would be judged by other times according to its reception of his plays. "Clouds" was awarded third (i.e. last) place after its original performance and the text that has come down to the modern age was a subsequent draft that Aristophanes intended to be read rather than acted. The circulation of his plays in manuscript extended their influence beyond the original audience, over whom in fact they seem to have had little or no practical influence: they did not affect the career of <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a>, they failed to persuade the Athenians to pursue an honourable peace with Sparta and it is not clear that they were instrumental in the trial and execution of Socrates, whose death probably resulted from public animosity towards the philosopher's disgraced associates (such as <a href="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>), exacerbated of course by his own intransigence during the trial. The plays, in manuscript form, have been put to some surprising uses — as indicated <a href="Aristophanes%23Aristophanes%20the%20Poet">earlier</a>, they were used in the study of rhetoric on the recommendation of <a href="Quintilian">Quintilian</a> and by students of the Attic dialect in the Fourth and Fifth Centuries AD. It is possible that Plato sent copies of the plays to Dionysius of Syracuse so that he might learn about Athenian life and government.

Latin translations of the plays by <a href="Andreas%20Divus">Andreas Divus</a> (Venice 1528) were circulated widely throughout Europe in the Renaissance and these were soon followed by translations and adaptations in modern languages. <a href="Jean%20Racine">Racine</a>, for example, drew "Les Plaideurs" (1668) from "The Wasps". <a href="Goethe">Goethe</a> (who turned to Aristophanes for a warmer and more vivid form of comedy than he could derive from readings of Terence and Plautus) adapted a short play "Die Vögel" from "The Birds" for performance in Weimar. Aristophanes has appealed to both conservatives and radicals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries — Anatoly Lunacharsky, first Commissar of Enlightenment for the USSR in 1917, declared that the ancient dramatist would have a permanent place in proletarian theatre and yet conservative, Prussian intellectuals interpreted Aristophanes as a satirical opponent of social reform. The avant-gardist stage-director <a href="Karolos%20Koun">Karolos Koun</a> directed a version of "The Birds" under the Acropolis in 1959 that established a trend in modern Greek history of breaking taboos through the voice of Aristophanes.

The plays have a significance that goes beyond their artistic function, as historical documents that open the window on life and politics in <a href="classical%20Athens">classical Athens</a>, in which respect they are perhaps as important as the writings of <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>. The artistic influence of the plays is immeasurable. They have contributed to the history of European theatre and that history in turn shapes our understanding of the plays. Thus for example the operettas of <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> can give us insights into Aristophanes' plays and similarly the plays can give us insights into the operettas. The plays are a source of famous sayings, such as "By words the mind is winged."

Listed below is a random and very tiny sample of works influenced (more or less) by Aristophanes.





Most of these are traditionally referred to by abbreviations of their "Latin" titles; Latin remains a customary language of scholarship in classical studies.

Albert Schweitzer

Albert Schweitzer, <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">OM</a> (14 January 1875 – 4 September 1965) was a French-German theologian, organist, writer, humanitarian, philosopher, and physician. A <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, Schweitzer challenged both the secular view of <a href="historical%20Jesus">Jesus as depicted by historical-critical methodology</a> current at this time, as well as the traditional <a href="Christology">Christian view</a>. His contributions to the interpretation of <a href="Pauline%20Christianity">Pauline Christianity</a> concern the role of <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a>'s <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a> of “being in Christ” as primary and the doctrine of <a href="Justification%20by%20faith">Justification by Faith</a> as secondary.

He received the 1952 <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his philosophy of “<a href="Reverence%20for%20Life">Reverence for Life</a>”, expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the <a href="Albert%20Schweitzer%20Hospital">Albert Schweitzer Hospital</a> in <a href="Lambar%C3%A9n%C3%A9">Lambaréné</a>, now in <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>, west central Africa (then French Equatorial Africa). As a music scholar and organist, he studied the music of German composer <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> and influenced the <a href="Organ%20reform%20movement">Organ Reform Movement</a> ("Orgelbewegung").

Schweitzer was born in the province of <a href="Alsace-Lorraine">Alsace-Lorraine</a>, which changed hands between France and Germany near and during his lifetime. Schweitzer considered himself <a href="French%20people">French</a> and wrote mostly in German. His mother-tongue was <a href="Alsatian%20dialect">Alsatian</a>.

Schweitzer was born in Kaysersberg, <a href="Alsace-Lorraine">Alsace-Lorraine</a>, the son of Louis Schweitzer and Adèle Schillinger. He spent his childhood in the Alsatian village of <a href="Gunsbach">Gunsbach</a>, where his father, the local <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran-Evangelical</a> pastor of the <a href="EPCAAL">EPCAAL</a>, taught him how to play music. The tiny village is home to the <a href="Association%20Internationale%20Albert%20Schweitzer">Association Internationale Albert Schweitzer</a> (AIAS). The medieval parish church of Gunsbach was shared by the Protestant and Catholic congregations, which held their prayers in different areas at different times on Sundays. This compromise arose after the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> and the <a href="Thirty%20Years%20War">Thirty Years War</a>. Schweitzer, the pastor's son, grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance, and developed the belief that true Christianity should always work towards a unity of Faith and Purpose.

Schweitzer's first language was the <a href="Alsatian%20dialect">Alsatian dialect</a>. At the <a href="Mulhouse">Mulhouse</a> <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">Gymnasium</a> he received his "<a href="Abitur">Abitur</a>" (the certificate at the end of secondary education) in 1893. He studied organ in Mulhouse from 1885 to 1893 with Eugène Munch, organist at the Protestant cathedral, who inspired Schweitzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of the German composer <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>. In 1893 he played for the French <a href="organist">organist</a> <a href="Charles-Marie%20Widor">Charles-Marie Widor</a> (at <a href="Saint-Sulpice%2C%20Paris">Saint-Sulpice, Paris</a>), for whom <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>'s organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal. Widor, deeply impressed, agreed to teach Schweitzer without fee, and a great and influential friendship thus began.

From 1893 Schweitzer studied Protestant theology at the <a href="University%20of%20Strasbourg">Kaiser Wilhelm University</a> in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. There he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor Gustav Jacobsthal, and associated closely with Ernest Munch (the brother of his former teacher), organist of St William church, who was also a passionate admirer of J.S. Bach's music. Schweitzer served his one-year compulsory military service in 1894. Schweitzer saw many operas of Richard Wagner in Strasbourg (under <a href="Otto%20Lohse">Otto Lohse</a>) and in 1896 he managed to afford a visit to the <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth</a> to see Wagner's "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a>" and "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>", which deeply impressed him. In 1898 he went back to Paris to write a PhD dissertation on "The Religious Philosophy of <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a>" at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a>, and to study in earnest with Widor. Here he often met with the elderly <a href="Aristide%20Cavaill%C3%A9-Coll">Aristide Cavaillé-Coll</a>. He also studied piano at that time with <a href="Marie%20Ja%C3%ABll">Marie Jaëll</a>. He completed his theology degree in 1899 and published his PhD thesis at the <a href="University%20of%20T%C3%BCbingen">University of Tübingen</a> in 1899.

Schweitzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organist, dedicated also to the rescue, restoration and study of historic <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a>s. With theological insight, he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">J. S. Bach</a>'s religious music. In 1899 he astonished Widor by explaining figures and motifs in Bach's <a href="Chorale%20Preludes">Chorale Preludes</a> as painter-like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based. They were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas, conceived visually. Widor had not grown up with knowledge of the old <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> hymns.

The exposition of these ideas, encouraged by Widor and Munch, became Schweitzer's last task, and appeared in the masterly study "J. S. Bach: Le Musicien-Poète", written in French and published in 1905. There was great demand for a German edition, but, instead of translating it, he decided to rewrite it. The result was two volumes ("J. S. Bach"), which were published in 1908 and translated into English by <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> in 1911. During its preparation he became a friend of <a href="Cosima%20Wagner">Cosima Wagner</a>, then resident in Strasbourg, with whom he had many theological and musical conversations, exploring his view of Bach's descriptive music, and playing the major Chorale Preludes for her at the Temple Neuf. Schweitzer's interpretative approach greatly influenced the modern understanding of Bach's music. He became a welcome guest at the Wagners' home, <a href="Wahnfried">Wahnfried</a>. He also corresponded with composer <a href="Clara%20Mathilda%20Faisst">Clara Faisst</a> and the two became good friends.

His pamphlet "The Art of Organ Building and Organ Playing in Germany and France" (1906, republished with an appendix on the state of the organ-building industry in 1927) effectively launched the 20th-century "<a href="Orgelbewegung">Orgelbewegung</a>", which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principles—although this sweeping reform movement in organ building eventually went further than Schweitzer himself had intended. In 1909 he addressed the "Third Congress of the International Society of Music" at <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> on the subject. Having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ-builders in several European countries, he produced a very considered report. This provided the basis for the "International Regulations for Organ Building". He envisaged instruments in which the French late-romantic full-organ sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic <a href="reed%20pipe">reed pipe</a>s, and with the classical Alsace <a href="Gottfried%20Silbermann">Silbermann</a> organ resources and baroque <a href="flue%20pipe">flue pipe</a>s, all in registers regulated (by <a href="Organ%20stop">stops</a>) to access distinct voices in <a href="fugue">fugue</a> or <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> capable of combination without loss of distinctness: different voices singing together in the same music.

Schweitzer also studied piano under <a href="Isidor%20Philipp">Isidor Philipp</a>, head of the piano department at the <a href="Paris%20Conservatory">Paris Conservatory</a>.

In 1905 Widor and Schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the <a href="Paris%20Bach%20Society">Paris Bach Society</a>, a choir dedicated to performing J.S. Bach's music, for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913. He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orféo Català at <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and often travelled there for that purpose. He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of Bach's <a href="List%20of%20compositions%20by%20Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach%23Works%20for%20organ">organ works</a>, with detailed analysis of each work in three languages (English, French, German). Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach's notation with no additional markings, wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912–14. Three more, to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzer's analyses, were to be worked on in Africa: but these were never completed, perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought.

On departure for Lambaréné in 1913 he was presented with a <a href="pedal%20piano">pedal piano</a>, a piano with pedal attachments (to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard). Built especially for the tropics, it was delivered by river in a huge dug-out canoe to Lambaréné, packed in a zinc-lined case. At first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art, and fell out of practice: but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of Bach, <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, <a href="Widor">Widor</a>, <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a>, and <a href="Max%20Reger">Max Reger</a> systematically. It became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on Sunday afternoons. Schweitzer's pedal piano was still in use at Lambaréné in 1946. And according to a visitor, Dr. Gaine Cannon, of Balsam Grove, N.C., the old, dilapidated piano-organ was still being played by Dr. Schweitzer in 1962 and stories told that "his fingers were still lively" on the old instrument at 88 years of age.

Sir <a href="Donald%20Tovey">Donald Tovey</a> dedicated his conjectural completion of Bach's "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Fugue">The Art of Fugue</a>" to Schweitzer.

Schweitzer's recordings of organ-music, and his innovative recording technique, are described separately below.

One of his notable pupils was conductor and composer <a href="Hans%20M%C3%BCnch%20%28conductor%29">Hans Münch</a>.

In 1899 Schweitzer became a deacon at the <a href="Saint%20Nicholas%20Church%2C%20Strasbourg">church of Saint Nicholas</a> in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. In 1900, with the completion of his licentiate in theology, he was ordained as curate, and that year he witnessed the <a href="Oberammergau%20Passion%20Play">Oberammergau Passion Play</a>. In the following year he became provisional Principal of the Theological College of <a href="Saint%20Thomas%20Church%20%28Strasbourg%29">Saint Thomas</a> (from which he had just graduated), and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent.

In 1906 he published "Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung" ("History of Life-of-Jesus research"). This book, which established his reputation, was first published in English in 1910 as "<a href="The%20Quest%20of%20the%20Historical%20Jesus">The Quest of the Historical Jesus</a>". Under this title the book became famous in the English-speaking world. A second German edition was published in 1913, containing theologically significant revisions and expansions: but this revised edition did not appear in English until 2001. Later, in 1931, he published "Mystik des Apostels Paulus" ("The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle"). A second edition was published in 1953.

In "The Quest", Schweitzer reviewed all former work on the "historical Jesus" back to the late 18th century. He showed that the image of Jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors, and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous century's findings. He maintained that the life of Jesus must be interpreted in the light of Jesus' own convictions, which reflected late Jewish <a href="eschatology">eschatology</a>. Schweitzer writes:
The concept that Christianity started as a Jewish apocalyptic movement is evidenced by the teachings of the Historical Jesus concerning the end of days. Not only did he preach he would rise from the grave, but that he would also ascend to the Heaven and one day return to judge and rule over the world, saying that no one, including himself, knew the exact time of his return, but it would be before the end of his generation. Schweitzer verified the many New Testament references clearly explaining that 1st-century Christians believed in the imminent fulfillment of the promise of the World's ending, within the lifetime of Jesus's original followers. He noted that in the gospel of Mark, Jesus speaks of a "tribulation", with his coming in the clouds with great power and glory" (St Mark), and states when it will happen: "This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled" (St Matthew, 24:34) (or, "have taken place" (Luke 21:32))

In The Quest of the Historical Jesus, Schweitzer observes the Bible contradicting the possibility of important events that never took place and never can take place as they are described; Jesus specifically states that we are to "not seal up the words of the prophecy" and promises that some of his listeners as well as the high priest at his trial would be alive to see him return to the Earth. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near" (Revelation 1:3). Saint Paul spoke of the "last times": "Brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none" (1 Corinthians 7:29); "God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son" (Hebrews 1:2); "There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom" (Matthew 16:28) (or, "until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power" (Mark 9:1); or, "till they see the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:27).)

Schweitzer continues writing in "The Quest of the Historical Jesus" that it is totally unreasonable to think that "coming quickly", "near", and "soon" could mean hundreds of years, much less, thousands of years in the future. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near." (Revelation 1:3) "And he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true'; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place." "And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book." And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near" (Revelation 22:6, 7, 10, 12). "All these things shall come upon this generation" (Matthew 23:36). Schweitzer concludes that the 1st-century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is totally incompatible with modern Christian belief.

In "The Quest of the Historical Jesus", Schweitzer notes the passage "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near." (Revelation 1:3) Similarly in St Peter: "Christ .. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you" (1 Peter 1:20), and "But the end of all things is at hand" (1 Peter 4:7). "Surely I come quickly" (Revelation 22:20). Schweitzer felt that St. Paul clearly believed in the immediacy of the "Second Coming of Jesus", in stark contrast to modern organized Christianity.

In "The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle", Schweitzer first distinguishes between two categories of <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>: primitive and developed. Primitive mysticism "has not yet risen to a conception of the universal, and is still confined to naive views of earthly and super-earthly, temporal and eternal." Additionally, he argues that this view of a "union with the divinity, brought about by efficacious ceremonies, is found even in quite primitive religions."

On the other hand, a more developed form of mysticism can be found in the Greek mystery-cults that were popular in 1st CE society. These included the cults of <a href="Attis">Attis</a>, <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, and <a href="Mithras">Mithras</a>. A developed form of mysticism is attained when the "conception of the universal is reached and a man reflects upon his relation to the totality of being and to Being in itself." Schweitzer claims that this form of mysticism is more intellectual and can be found "among the <a href="Brahman">Brahman</a>s and in the <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>, in <a href="Platonism">Platonism</a>, in <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>, in <a href="Spinoza">Spinoza</a>, <a href="Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>, and <a href="Hegel">Hegel</a>."

Next, Schweitzer poses the question: "Of what precise kind then is the mysticism of Paul?" He locates Paul between the two extremes of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism. Paul stands high above primitive mysticism, due to his intellectual writings, but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead, he conceives of <a href="Adoption%20%28theology%29">sonship</a> to God as "mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ." He summarizes Pauline mysticism as "being in Christ" rather than "being in God."

Paul’s imminent <a href="eschatology">eschatology</a> (from his background in <a href="Jewish%20eschatology">Jewish Eschatology</a>) causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ. Christ-mysticism holds the field until God-mysticism becomes possible, which is in the near future. Therefore, Schweitzer argues that Paul is the only theologian who does not claim that Christians can have an experience of "being-in-God." Rather, Paul uses the phrase "being-in-Christ" to illustrate how Jesus is a mediator between the Christian community and God. Additionally, Schweitzer explains how the experience of "being-in-Christ" is not a "static partaking in the spiritual being of Christ, but as the real co-experiencing of His dying and rising again." The "realistic" partaking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community.

One of Schweitzer's major arguments in "The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle" is that Paul's mysticism, marked by his phrase "being in Christ", gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology. Rather than reading <a href="justification%20by%20faith">justification by faith</a> as the main topic of Pauline thought, which has been the most popular argument set forward by <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, Schweitzer argues that Paul's emphasis was on the mystical union with God by "being in Christ." <a href="Jaroslav%20Pelikan">Jaroslav Pelikan</a>, in his Forward to "The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle," points out that:
Schweitzer contrasts Paul’s "realistic" dying and rising with Christ to the "symbolism" of <a href="Hellenism%20%28Greek%20culture%29">Hellenism</a>. Although Paul is widely influenced by Hellenistic thought, he is not controlled by it. Schweitzer explains that Paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the "realistic" dying and rising with Christ rather than the "symbolic" Hellenistic act of becoming like Christ through <a href="deification">deification</a>. After baptism, the Christian is continually renewed throughout his or her lifetime due to participation in the dying and rising with Christ (most notably through the <a href="Sacraments%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Sacraments</a>). On the other hand, the Hellenist "lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation" and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience.

Another major difference between Paul's "realism" and Hellenistic "symbolism" is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter. Schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes the fact that "Paul’s thought follows <a href="Predestination">predestinarian</a> lines." He explains, "only the man who is <a href="Election%20%28Christianity%29">elected</a> thereto can enter into relation with God." Although every human being is invited to become a Christian, only those who have undergone the initiation into the Christian community through <a href="baptism">baptism</a> can share in the "realistic" dying and rising with Christ.

At the age of 30, in 1905, Schweitzer answered the call of The Society of the Evangelist Missions of Paris, which was looking for a <a href="medical%20doctor">medical doctor</a>. However, the committee of this missionary society was not ready to accept his offer, considering his Lutheran theology to be "incorrect". He could easily have obtained a place in a German evangelical mission, but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties. Amid a hail of protests from his friends, family and colleagues, he resigned his post and re-entered the university as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of Doctorate in Medicine, a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labour of healing, rather than through the verbal process of preaching, and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.

Even in his study of medicine, and through his clinical course, Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work, he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911. His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus, "The Psychiatric Study of Jesus". In June 1912, he married <a href="Helene%20Bresslau%20Schweitzer">Helene Bresslau</a>, municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the Jewish pan-Germanist historian <a href="Harry%20Bresslau">Harry Bresslau</a>.

In 1912, now armed with a medical degree, Schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Society's mission at <a href="Lambar%C3%A9n%C3%A9">Lambaréné</a> on the <a href="Ogoou%C3%A9">Ogooué</a> river, in what is now <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>, in Africa (then a French colony). He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine, but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted. Through concerts and other fund-raising, he was ready to equip a small hospital. In spring 1913, he and his wife set off to establish a hospital (<a href="Albert%20Schweitzer%20Hospital">Albert Schweitzer Hospital</a>) near an already existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft) upstream from the mouth of the Ogooué at <a href="Port%20Gentil">Port Gentil</a> (<a href="Cape%20Lopez">Cape Lopez</a>) (and so accessible to external communications), but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambaréné.

In the first nine months, he and his wife had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In addition to injuries, he was often treating severe <a href="sandflea">sandflea</a> and crawcraw sores, "<a href="framboesia">framboesia</a>" (yaws), tropical <a href="Ulcer%20%28dermatology%29">eating sores</a>, heart disease, tropical <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, tropical <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">sleeping sickness</a>, <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a>, fevers, strangulated <a href="hernias">hernias</a>, <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a>, abdominal tumours and chronic <a href="constipation">constipation</a> and <a href="nicotine%20poisoning">nicotine poisoning</a>, while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings, <a href="fetishism">fetishism</a> and fear of <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a> among the <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Gabon">Mbahouin</a>.

Schweitzer's wife, Helene Schweitzer, was an anaesthetist for surgical operations. After briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were built, like native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking <a href="Galoa">Galoa</a> (<a href="Mpongwe">Mpongwe</a>) who first came as a patient.

When World War I broke out in summer of 1914, Schweitzer and his wife, German citizens in a French colony, were put under supervision at Lambaréné by the French military, where Schweitzer continued his work. In 1917, exhausted by over four years' work and by tropical <a href="anaemia">anaemia</a>, they were taken to <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> and interned first in <a href="Garaison">Garaison</a> and then from March 1918 in <a href="Saint-R%C3%A9my-de-Provence">Saint-Rémy-de-Provence</a>. In July 1918, after being transferred to his home in Alsace, he was a free man again. At this time Schweitzer, born a German citizen, had his parents' former (pre-1871) French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then, working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg, he advanced his project on The Philosophy of Civilization, which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920, his health recovering, he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922, he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in Oxford University, and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work, "The Decay and Restoration of Civilization" and "Civilization and Ethics". The two remaining volumes, on "The World-View of Reverence for Life " and a fourth on the Civilized State, were never completed.

In 1924, he returned without his wife but with an Oxford undergraduate, <a href="Noel%20Gillespie">Noel Gillespie</a>, as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed, and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had <a href="salvarsan">salvarsan</a> for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann, joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included <a href="Suramin">Germanin</a> and <a href="tryparsamide">tryparsamide</a>. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera <a href="vibrion">vibrion</a> (facultative anaerobic bacteria). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.

He was there again from 1929 to 1932. Gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged, not only in Europe, but worldwide. There was a further period of work in 1935. In January 1937, he returned again to Lambaréné and continued working there throughout World War II.

Schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response to Jesus' call to become "fishers of men" but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of European <a href="colonialism">colonizers</a>:
Schweitzer was one of colonialism's harshest critics. In a sermon that he preached on 6 January 1905, before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a doctor in Africa, he said:

Schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being <a href="Paternalism">paternalistic</a>, <a href="Colonialism">colonialist</a> and <a href="Racism">racist</a> in his attitude towards Africans, and in some ways his views did differ from that of many <a href="Liberalism">liberals</a> and other critics of colonialism. For instance, he thought that Gabonese independence came too early, without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances. <a href="Edgar%20Berman">Edgar Berman</a> quotes Schweitzer as having said in 1960, "No society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow." Schweitzer believed dignity and respect must be extended to blacks, while also sometimes characterizing them as children. He summarized his views on European-African relations by saying "The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother." <a href="Chinua%20Achebe">Chinua Achebe</a> has criticized him for this characterization, though Achebe acknowledges that Schweitzer's use of the word "brother" at all was, for a European of the early 20th century, an unusual expression of human solidarity between Europeans and Africans. Schweitzer eventually emended and complicated this notion with his later statement that "The time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed". Later in life he became more convinced that "modern civilization" was actually inferior to or the same as previous cultures in terms of morality.

American journalist John Gunther also visited Lambaréné in the 1950s and reported Schweitzer's patronizing attitude towards Africans. He also noted the lack of Africans trained to be skilled workers. By comparison, his contemporary <a href="Albert%20Ruskin%20Cook">Sir Albert Cook</a> in Uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 1910s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of Luganda. After three decades in Africa Schweitzer still depended on Europe for nurses.

The journalist <a href="James%20Cameron%20%28journalist%29">James Cameron</a> visited Lambaréné in 1953 (when Schweitzer was 78) and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of Schweitzer and his staff. The hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities, and Schweitzer had little contact with the local people. Cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time: according to a BBC dramatisation, he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story, and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposé.

The poor conditions of the hospital in Lambaréné were also famously criticized by Nigerian professor and novelist <a href="Chinua%20Achebe">Chinua Achebe</a> in his essay on <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>'s novel "<a href="Heart%20of%20Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a>": "In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being."

The keynote of Schweitzer's personal philosophy (which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind) was the idea of "<a href="Reverence%20for%20Life">Reverence for Life</a>" (""Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben""). He thought that <a href="Western%20culture">Western civilization</a> was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its <a href="Ethics">ethical</a> foundation.

In the Preface to "Civilization and Ethics" (1923) he argued that Western philosophy from <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">Descartes</a> to <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a> had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found, and the rational, life-affirming optimism of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view, as material knowledge, and the life-view, understood as <a href="Will%20%28philosophy%29">Will</a>, expressed in the <a href="Pessimism">pessimist</a> philosophies from <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a> onward. Scientific <a href="materialism">materialism</a> (advanced by <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a> and <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics, entirely an expression of the will-to-live.

Schweitzer wrote, "True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness, and this may be formulated as follows: 'I am life which wills to live, and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live.'" In nature one form of life must always prey upon another. However, human consciousness holds an awareness of, and sympathy for, the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.

Though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>ic philosophy.

For Schweitzer, mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to <a href="Volition%20%28psychology%29">volition</a> or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.

Such was the theory which Schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life. According to some authors, Schweitzer's thought, and specifically his development of reverence for life, was influenced by <a href="Indian%20religions">Indian religious</a> thought and in particular the <a href="Jainism">Jain</a> principle of <a href="Ahimsa%20in%20Jainism">ahimsa</a>, or non-violence Albert Schweitzer has noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book "Indian Thought and Its Development":

After the birth of their daughter (<a href="Rhena%20Schweitzer%20Miller">Rhena Schweitzer Miller</a>), Albert's wife, Helene Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to <a href="K%C3%B6nigsfeld%20im%20Schwarzwald">Königsfeld im Schwarzwald</a>, Baden-Württemberg, where he was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.

From 1939–48 he stayed in Lambaréné, unable to go back to Europe because of the war. Three years after the end of World War II, in 1948, he returned for the first time to Europe and kept traveling back and forth (and once to the US) as long as he was able. During his return visits to his home village of Gunsbach, Schweitzer continued to make use of the family house, which after his death became an Archive and Museum to his life and work. His life was portrayed in the 1952 movie "Il est minuit, Docteur Schweitzer", starring <a href="Pierre%20Fresnay">Pierre Fresnay</a> as Albert Schweitzer and <a href="Jeanne%20Moreau">Jeanne Moreau</a> as his nurse Marie. Schweitzer inspired actor <a href="Hugh%20O%27Brian">Hugh O'Brian</a> when O'Brian visited in Africa. O'Brian returned to the United States and founded the <a href="Hugh%20O%27Brian%20Youth%20Leadership%20Foundation">Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation</a> (HOBY).

Schweitzer was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> of 1952, and his acceptance speech, "The Problem of Peace", is considered one of the best speeches ever given. From 1952 until his death he worked against <a href="nuclear%20tests">nuclear tests</a> and <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s with <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>. In 1957 and 1958 he broadcast four speeches over Radio Oslo which were published in "Peace or Atomic War". In 1957, Schweitzer was one of the founders of <a href="Peace%20Action">The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy</a>. On 23 April 1957, Schweitzer made his "Declaration of Conscience" speech; it was broadcast to the world over Radio Oslo, pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons. His speech ended, "The end of further experiments with atom bombs would be like the early sunrays of hope which suffering humanity is longing for."

Weeks prior to his death, an American film crew was allowed to visit Schweitzer and Drs. Muntz and Friedman, both Holocaust survivors, to record his work and daily life at the hospital. The film "The Legacy of Albert Schweitzer", narrated by Henry Fonda, was produced by Warner Brothers and aired once. It resides in their vault today in deteriorating condition. Although several attempts have been made to restore and re-air the film, all access has been denied.

In 1955 he was made an honorary member of the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> by <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. He was also a <a href="Knight">chevalier</a> of the <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Lazarus">Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem</a>. Schweitzer died on 4 September 1965 at his beloved hospital in <a href="Lambar%C3%A9n%C3%A9">Lambaréné</a>, Gabon. His grave, on the banks of the <a href="Ogoou%C3%A9%20River">Ogooué River</a>, is marked by a cross he made himself.

His cousin Anne-Marie Schweitzer Sartre was the mother of <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>. Her father, Charles Schweitzer, was the older brother of Albert Schweitzer's father, Louis Théophile.

Schweitzer was a vegetarian.

The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship was founded in 1940 by Schweitzer to unite US supporters in filling the gap in support for his Hospital when his European supply lines were cut off by war, and continues to support the Lambaréné Hospital today. Schweitzer, however, considered his ethic of Reverence for Life, not his Hospital, his most important legacy, saying that his Lambaréné Hospital was just "my own improvisation on the theme of Reverence for Life. Everyone can have their own Lambaréné." Today ASF helps large numbers of young Americans in health-related professional fields find or create "their own Lambaréné" in the US or internationally. ASF selects and supports nearly 250 new US and Africa Schweitzer Fellows each year from over 100 of the leading US schools of medicine, nursing, public health, and every other health-related field (including music, law, and divinity), helping launch them on lives of Schweitzer-spirited service. The peer-supporting lifelong network of "Schweitzer Fellows for Life" numbered over 2,000 members in 2008, and is growing by nearly 1,000 every four years. Nearly 150 of these Schweitzer Fellows have served at the Hospital in Lambaréné, for three-month periods during their last year of medical school.

The prize was first awarded on 29 May 2011 to <a href="Eugen%20Drewermann">Eugen Drewermann</a> and the physician couple Rolf and Raphaela Maibach in <a href="K%C3%B6nigsfeld%20im%20Schwarzwald">Königsfeld im Schwarzwald</a>, where Schweitzer's former residence now houses the Albert Schweitzer Museum.

Recordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD. During 1934 and 1935 he resided in Britain, delivering the Gifford Lectures at <a href="Edinburgh%20University">Edinburgh University</a>, and those on "Religion in Modern Civilization" at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a> and <a href="University%20of%20London">London</a>. He had originally conducted trials for recordings for HMV on the organ of the old <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> in London. These records did not satisfy him, the instrument being too harsh. In mid-December 1935 he began to record for <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> on the organ of <a href="All%20Hallows-by-the-Tower">All Hallows, Barking-by-the-Tower</a> (London). Then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the <a href="Saint%20Aurelia%27s%20Church%2C%20Strasbourg">church of Ste Aurélie</a> in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, on a mid-18th-century organ by Johann Andreas <a href="Gottfried%20Silbermann">Silbermann</a> (brother of Gottfried), an organ-builder greatly revered by Bach, which had been restored by the <a href="Lorraine">Lorraine</a> organ-builder Frédéric Härpfer shortly before the First World War. These recordings were made in the course of a fortnight in October 1936.

Schweitzer developed a technique for recording the performances of Bach's music. Known as "The Schweitzer Technique", it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side. The mid-side sees a <a href="Microphone%23Bi-directional">figure-8 microphone</a> pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single <a href="Microphone%23Cardioid">cardioid microphone</a> is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm <a href="Microphone%23Condenser%20microphone">condenser microphones</a> pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.

Altogether his early Columbia discs included 25 records of Bach and eight of César Franck. The Bach titles were mainly distributed as follows:
Later recordings were made at Parish church, Günsbach: These recordings were made by C. Robert Fine during the time Dr. Schweitzer was being filmed in Günsbach for the documentary "Albert Schweitzer." Fine originally self-released the recordings but later licensed the masters to Columbia.
The above were released in the United States of America as Columbia Masterworks boxed set SL-175.

<doc id="1030" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1030" title="Austrian School">
Austrian School

The Austrian School is a <a href="Schools%20of%20economic%20thought">school of economic thought</a> that is based on <a href="methodological%20individualism">methodological individualism</a> – the concept that social phenomena result from the motivations and actions of individuals. It originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of <a href="Carl%20Menger">Carl Menger</a>, <a href="Eugen%20B%C3%B6hm%20von%20Bawerk">Eugen Böhm von Bawerk</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Wieser">Friedrich von Wieser</a>, and others. It was methodologically opposed to the <a href="Historical%20school%20of%20economics">Prussian Historical School</a> (in a dispute known as <a href="Methodenstreit">Methodenstreit</a>). Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many different countries, but their work is still referred to as Austrian economics.

Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the <a href="subjective%20theory%20of%20value">subjective theory of value</a>, <a href="marginalism">marginalism</a> in <a href="microeconomics">price theory</a>, and the formulation of the <a href="economic%20calculation%20problem">economic calculation problem</a>, each of which has become an accepted part of <a href="mainstream%20economics">mainstream economics</a>.

Since the mid-20th century, many economists have been critical of the modern day Austrian School and consider its rejection of <a href="econometrics">econometrics</a> and aggregate <a href="macroeconomics">macroeconomic</a> analysis to be outside of mainstream economic theory, or "<a href="Heterodox%20economics">heterodox</a>". Austrians are likewise critical of mainstream economics. Although the Austrian School has been considered heterodox since the late 1930s, it attracted renewed interest in the 1970s, after <a href="Friedrich%20Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a> shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

The Austrian School owes its name to members of the German <a href="historical%20school%20of%20economics">historical school of economics</a>, who argued against the Austrians during the late-19th century "<a href="Methodenstreit">Methodenstreit</a>" ("methodology struggle"), in which the Austrians defended the role of theory in economics as distinct from the study or compilation of historical circumstance. In 1883, Menger published "Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics", which attacked the methods of the Historical school. <a href="Gustav%20von%20Schmoller">Gustav von Schmoller</a>, a leader of the Historical school, responded with an unfavorable review, coining the term "Austrian School" in an attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincial. The label endured and was adopted by the adherents themselves.

The school originated in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, in the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>. <a href="Carl%20Menger">Carl Menger</a>'s 1871 book, "<a href="Principles%20of%20Economics%20%28Menger%29">Principles of Economics</a>", is generally considered the founding of the Austrian School. The book was one of the first modern treatises to advance the theory of <a href="marginal%20utility">marginal utility</a>. The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the marginalist revolution of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist approach in economics. While marginalism was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that began to coalesce around Menger's work, which came to be known as the “Psychological School,” “Vienna School,” or “Austrian School.”

Menger's contributions to economic theory were closely followed by those of <a href="Eugen%20B%C3%B6hm%20von%20Bawerk">Eugen Böhm von Bawerk</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Wieser">Friedrich von Wieser</a>. These three economists became what is known as the "first wave" of the Austrian School. Böhm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> in the 1880s and 1890s, as was part of the Austrians' participation in the late 19th-century "<a href="Methodenstreit">Methodenstreit</a>", during which they attacked the <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Hegelian</a> doctrines of the <a href="Historical%20school%20of%20economics">Historical School</a>.

<a href="Frank%20Albert%20Fetter">Frank Albert Fetter</a> (1863-1949) was a leader in the United States of Austrian thought; he obtained his PhD in 1894 from the <a href="University%20of%20Halle">University of Halle</a> and then was made Professor of Political Economy and Finance at <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell</a> in 1901. Several important Austrian economists trained at the University of Vienna in the 1920s and later participated in private seminars held by <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a>. These included <a href="Gottfried%20Haberler">Gottfried Haberler</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Machlup">Fritz Machlup</a>, <a href="Karl%20Menger">Karl Menger</a> (son of Carl Menger), Oskar Morgenstern, Paul Rosenstein-Rodan <a href="Abraham%20Wald">Abraham Wald</a>, among others.

By the mid-1930s, most economists had embraced what they considered the important contributions of the early Austrians. Fritz Machlup quoted Hayek's statement, "the greatest success of a school is that it stops existing because its fundamental teachings have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted thought." Sometime during the middle of the twentieth century, Austrian economics became disregarded or derided by mainstream economists because it rejected <a href="economic%20model">model</a> building, and mathematical and statistical methods in the study of economics. Mises' student, <a href="Israel%20Kirzner">Israel Kirzner</a> recalled that in 1954, when Kirzner was pursuing his PhD, there was no separate Austrian School as such. When Kirzner was deciding which graduate school to attend, Mises had advised him to accept an offer of admission at Johns Hopkins because it was a prestigious university and <a href="Fritz%20Machlup">Fritz Machlup</a> taught there.

After the 1940s, Austrian economics can be divided into two schools of economic thought, and the school "split" to some degree in the late 20th century. One camp of Austrians, exemplified by Mises, regards neoclassical methodology to be irredeemably flawed; the other camp, exemplified by Friedrich Hayek, accepts a large part of neoclassical methodology and is more accepting of government intervention in the economy. <a href="Henry%20Hazlitt">Henry Hazlitt</a> wrote economics columns and editorials for a number of publications and wrote many books on the topic of Austrian economics from the 1930s to the 1980s. Hazlitt's thinking was influenced by Mises. His book "<a href="Economics%20in%20One%20Lesson">Economics in One Lesson</a>" (1946) sold over a million copies, and he is also known for "<a href="The%20Failure%20of%20the%20New%20Economics">The Failure of the "New Economics"</a>" (1959), a line-by-line critique of <a href="John%20Maynard%20Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>'s "<a href="The%20General%20Theory%20of%20Employment%2C%20Interest%20and%20Money">General Theory</a>".

The reputation of the Austrian School rose in the late-20th century due in part to the work of Israel Kirzner and <a href="Ludwig%20Lachmann">Ludwig Lachmann</a> at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, and to renewed public awareness of the work of Hayek after he won the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Hayek's work was influential in the revival of "laissez-faire" thought in the 20th century.

According to economist <a href="Bryan%20Caplan">Bryan Caplan</a>, by the late twentieth century, a split had developed among those who self-identify with the Austrian School. One group, building on the work of Hayek, follows the broad framework of mainstream neoclassical economics, including its use of mathematical models and general equilibrium, and brings a critical perspective to mainstream methodology merely influenced by the Austrian notions such as the <a href="economic%20calculation%20problem">economic calculation problem</a> and the independent role of logical reasoning in developing economic theory.
A second group, following Mises and Rothbard, rejects the neoclassical theories of consumer and welfare economics, dismisses empirical methods and mathematical and statistical models as inapplicable to economic science, and asserts that economic theory went entirely astray in the twentieth century; they offer the Misesian view as a radical alternative paradigm to mainstream theory. Caplan wrote that if "Mises and Rothbard are right, then [mainstream] economics is wrong; but if Hayek is right, then mainstream economics merely needs to adjust its focus."

Economist <a href="Leland%20Yeager">Leland Yeager</a> discussed the late twentieth century rift and referred to a discussion written by Murray Rothbard, <a href="Hans-Hermann%20Hoppe">Hans-Hermann Hoppe</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Salerno">Joseph Salerno</a>, and others in which they attack and disparage Hayek. Yeager stated, "To try to drive a wedge between Mises and Hayek on [the role of knowledge in economic calculation], especially to the disparagement of Hayek, is unfair to these two great men, unfaithful to the history of economic thought" and went on to call the rift subversive to economic analysis and the historical understanding of the fall of Eastern European communism.

In a 1999 book published by the <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Mises%20Institute">Ludwig von Mises Institute</a> (Mises Institute), Hans-Hermann Hoppe asserted that Murray Rothbard was the leader of the "mainstream within Austrian Economics" and contrasted Rothbard with Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek, whom he identified as a <a href="British%20empiricism">British empiricist</a> and an opponent of the thought of Mises and Rothbard. Hoppe acknowledged that Hayek was the most prominent Austrian economist within academia, but stated that Hayek was an opponent of the Austrian tradition which led from Carl Menger and Böhm-Bawerk through Mises to Rothbard. Austrian economist <a href="Walter%20Block">Walter Block</a> says that the "Austrian school" can be distinguished from other schools of economic thought through two categories – economic theory and political theory. According to Block, while Hayek can be considered an "Austrian economist", his views on political theory clash with the libertarian political theory which Block sees as an integral part of the Austrian school.

However, both criticisms from Hoppe and Block to Hayek seem to apply to the founder of the Austrian School, Carl Menger, too. Hoppe emphasizes that Hayek, which for him is from the English empirical tradition, is an opponent of the supposed rationalist tradition of the Austrian School. However, Carl Menger made strong critiques to rationalism in his works, in similar vein as Hayek's. He emphasized the idea that there are several institutions which were not deliberately created, have a kind of 'superior wisdom' and serves important functions to society. He also talked about Burke and the English tradition to sustain these positions.

Block, when saying that the libertarian political theory is an integral part of the Austrian School, and supposing Hayek isn't a libertarian, excludes Menger from the Austrian School too, once Menger seems to defend broader state activity than Hayek. As examples, progressive taxation and extensive labour legislation.

Economists of the Hayekian view are affiliated with the <a href="Cato%20Institute">Cato Institute</a>, <a href="George%20Mason%20University">George Mason University</a> (GMU), and New York University, among other institutions. They include <a href="Peter%20Boettke">Peter Boettke</a>, <a href="Roger%20Garrison">Roger Garrison</a>, <a href="Steven%20Horwitz">Steven Horwitz</a>, <a href="Peter%20Leeson">Peter Leeson</a> and <a href="George%20Reisman">George Reisman</a>. Economists of the Mises–Rothbard view include <a href="Walter%20Block">Walter Block</a>, <a href="Hans-Hermann%20Hoppe">Hans-Hermann Hoppe</a>, <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Huerta%20de%20Soto">Jesús Huerta de Soto</a> and <a href="Robert%20P.%20Murphy">Robert P. Murphy</a>, each of whom is associated with the Mises Institute and some of them also with academic institutions. According to Murphy, a "truce between (for lack of better terms) the GMU Austro-libertarians and the Auburn Austro-libertarians" was signed around 2011.

The Austrian School theorizes that the subjective choices of individuals including individual knowledge, time, expectation, and other subjective factors, cause all economic phenomena. Austrians seek to understand the economy by examining the social ramifications of individual choice, an approach called "<a href="methodological%20individualism">methodological individualism</a>". It differs from other schools of economic thought, which have focused on aggregate variables, equilibrium analysis, and societal groups rather than individuals.
In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, economists with a methodological lineage to the early Austrian School developed many diverse approaches and theoretical orientations. For example, in 1949, <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a> organized his version of the subjectivist approach, which he called "<a href="praxeology">praxeology</a>", in a book published in English as "<a href="Human%20Action">Human Action</a>". In it, Mises stated that praxeology could be used to deduce "a priori" theoretical economic truths and that deductive economic <a href="thought%20experiment">thought experiment</a>s could yield conclusions which follow irrefutably from the underlying assumptions. He wrote that conclusions could not be inferred from empirical observation or statistical analysis and argued against the use of probabilities in economic models.

Since Mises' time, some Austrian thinkers have accepted his praxeological approach, while others have adopted alternative methodologies. For example, <a href="Fritz%20Machlup">Fritz Machlup</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a>, and others, did not take Mises' strong "<a href="A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">a priori</a>" approach to economics. <a href="Ludwig%20Lachmann">Ludwig Lachmann</a>, a radical subjectivist, also largely rejected Mises' formulation of Praxeology in favor of the "verstehende Methode" (interpretive method) articulated by <a href="Max%20Weber">Max Weber</a>.

In the 20th century, various Austrians incorporated models and mathematics into their analysis. Austrian economist <a href="Steven%20Horwitz">Steven Horwitz</a> argued in 2000, that Austrian methodology is consistent with <a href="macroeconomics">macroeconomics</a> and that Austrian macroeconomics can be expressed in terms of <a href="microeconomics">microeconomic</a> foundations. Austrian economist Roger Garrison writes that Austrian macroeconomic theory can be correctly expressed in terms of <a href="diagram">diagrammatic models</a>. In 1944, Austrian economist Oskar Morgenstern presented a rigorous schematization of an ordinal utility function (the <a href="Von%20Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern%20utility%20theorem">Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</a>) in <a href="Theory%20of%20Games%20and%20Economic%20Behavior">Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</a>.

In 1981, <a href="Fritz%20Machlup">Fritz Machlup</a> listed the typical views of Austrian economic thinking as:

He included two additional tenets held by the Mises branch of Austrian economics:

The opportunity cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Wieser">Friedrich von Wieser</a> in the late 19th century. Opportunity cost is the cost of any activity measured in terms of the value of the next best alternative foregone (that is not chosen). It is the sacrifice related to the second best choice available to someone, or group, who has picked among several <a href="mutually%20exclusive">mutually exclusive</a> choices.

Opportunity cost is a key concept in mainstream <a href="economics">economics</a>, and has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between <a href="scarcity">scarcity</a> and <a href="utility">choice</a>". The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that resources are used efficiently.

The Austrian theory of capital and interest was first developed by <a href="Eugen%20B%C3%B6hm%20von%20Bawerk">Eugen Böhm von Bawerk</a>. He stated that interest rates and profits are determined by two factors, namely, <a href="supply%20and%20demand">supply and demand</a> in the market for final goods and time preference.

Böhm-Bawerk's theory equates <a href="capital%20intensity">capital intensity</a> with the degree of <a href="roundaboutness">roundaboutness</a> of production processes. Böhm-Bawerk also argued that the law of <a href="marginal%20utility">marginal utility</a> necessarily implies the classical law of costs. Some Austrian economists therefore entirely reject the notion that interest rates are affected by <a href="liquidity%20preference">liquidity preference</a>.

In Mises's definition, inflation is an increase in the supply of money:

In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader sense of the term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader sense of the term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur.

Hayek pointed out that inflationary stimulation exploits the lag between an increase in money supply and the consequent increase in the prices of goods and services:

And since any inflation, however modest at first, can help employment only so long as it accelerates, adopted as a means of reducing unemployment, it will do so for any length of time only while it accelerates. "Mild" steady inflation cannot help—it can lead only to outright inflation. That inflation at a constant rate soon ceases to have any stimulating effect, and in the end merely leaves us with a backlog of delayed adaptations, is the conclusive argument against the "mild" inflation represented as beneficial even in standard economics textbooks.

The economic calculation problem refers to a criticism of <a href="socialist%20economics">socialism</a> which was first stated by <a href="Max%20Weber">Max Weber</a> in 1920. Mises subsequently discussed Weber's idea with his student Friedrich Hayek, who developed it in various works including "<a href="The%20Road%20to%20Serfdom">The Road to Serfdom</a>". The problem concerns the means by which resources are allocated and distributed in an economy.

Austrian theory emphasizes the <a href="spontaneous%20order">organizing power</a> of markets. Hayek stated that market prices reflect information, the totality of which is not known to any single individual, which determines the allocation of resources in an economy. Because socialist systems lack the individual incentives and <a href="price%20discovery">price discovery</a> processes by which individuals act on their personal information, Hayek argued that socialist economic planners lack all of the knowledge required to make optimal decisions. Those who agree with this criticism view it as a refutation of socialism showing that socialism is not a viable or sustainable form of economic organization. The debate rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as "The Socialist Calculation Debate."

Mises argued in a 1920 essay "<a href="Economic%20Calculation%20in%20the%20Socialist%20Commonwealth">Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth</a>" that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned the <a href="means%20of%20production">means of production</a>, then no prices could be obtained for <a href="capital%20good">capital good</a>s as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not "objects of exchange," unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently. This led him to write "that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth."

The Austrian theory of the <a href="business%20cycle">business cycle</a> ("ABCT") focuses on banks' issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who believed that banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively <a href="Roundaboutness">roundabout</a> production processes. Mises stated that this led to a misallocation of resources which he called "<a href="malinvestment">malinvestment</a>".

According to <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a>, <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a>s enable the commercial banks to fund loans at artificially low interest rates, thereby inducing an unsustainable expansion of bank credit and impeding any subsequent contraction. <a href="Friedrich%20Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a> disagreed. Prior to the 1970s, Hayek did not favor <a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> in banking and said that a freely competitive banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical, mimicking the effects which Rothbard attributed to central bank policy. Hayek stated that the need for <a href="central%20banking">central banking</a> control was inescapable.

Many theories developed by "first wave" Austrian economists have long been absorbed into <a href="mainstream%20economics">mainstream economics</a>. These include Carl Menger's theories on marginal utility, Friedrich von Wieser's theories on <a href="opportunity%20cost">opportunity cost</a>, and Eugen Böhm von Bawerk's theories on time preference, as well as Menger and Böhm-Bawerk's criticisms of <a href="Marxian%20economics">Marxian economics</a>.

Former <a href="U.S.%20Federal%20Reserve">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> Chairman <a href="Alan%20Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a> said that the founders of the Austrian School "reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country." In 1987, Nobel Laureate <a href="James%20M.%20Buchanan">James M. Buchanan</a> told an interviewer, "I have no objections to being called an Austrian. Hayek and Mises might consider me an Austrian but, surely some of the others would not." Chinese economist <a href="Zhang%20Weiying">Zhang Weiying</a> supports some Austrian theories such as the Austrian theory of the business cycle.

Currently, universities with a significant Austrian presence are <a href="George%20Mason%20University">George Mason University</a>, <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, <a href="Loyola%20University%20New%20Orleans">Loyola University New Orleans</a>, and <a href="Auburn%20University">Auburn University</a> in the United States, <a href="King%20Juan%20Carlos%20University">King Juan Carlos University</a> in Spain and <a href="Universidad%20Francisco%20Marroqu%C3%ADn">Universidad Francisco Marroquín</a> in Guatemala. Austrian economic ideas are also promoted by privately funded organizations such as the <a href="Mises%20Institute">Mises Institute</a>, and the <a href="Cato%20Institute">Cato Institute</a>.

Mainstream economists have argued that Austrians are excessively averse to the use of mathematics and statistics in economics.

Economist <a href="Bryan%20Caplan">Bryan Caplan</a> argues that many Austrians have not understood valid contributions of modern mainstream economics, causing them to overstate their differences with it. For example, Murray Rothbard stated that he objected to the use of <a href="cardinal%20utility">cardinal utility</a> in microeconomic theory. Caplan says that Rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking, because microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results hold for any <a href="monotonic">monotonic</a> transformation of an <a href="ordinal%20utility">ordinal utility</a> function, and do not entail cardinal utility.

Economist <a href="Paul%20Krugman">Paul Krugman</a> has stated that because Austrians do not use "explicit models" they are unaware of holes in their own thinking.

Economist Benjamin Klein has criticized the economic methodological work of Austrian economist <a href="Israel%20M.%20Kirzner">Israel M. Kirzner</a>. While praising Kirzner for highlighting shortcomings in traditional methodology, Klein argued that Kirzner did not provide a viable alternative for economic methodology. Economist Tyler Cowen has written that Kirzner's theory of entrepreneurship can ultimately be reduced to a neoclassical search model and is thus not in the radical subjectivist tradition of Austrian praxeology. Cowen states that Kirzner's entrepreneurs can be modeled in mainstream terms of search.

Economist <a href="Jeffrey%20Sachs">Jeffrey Sachs</a> argues that among developed countries, those with high rates of taxation and high social welfare spending perform better on most measures of economic performance compared to countries with low rates of taxation and low social outlays. He concludes that Friedrich Hayek was wrong to argue that high levels of government spending harms an economy, and "a generous social-welfare state is not a road to serfdom but rather to fairness, economic equality and international competitiveness." Austrian economist <a href="Sudha%20Shenoy">Sudha Shenoy</a> responded by arguing that countries with large public sectors have grown more slowly.

Economist Bryan Caplan has noted that Mises has been criticized for overstating the strength of his case in describing socialism as "impossible" rather than as something that would need to establish non-market institutions to deal with the inefficiency.

Critics generally argue that Austrian economics lacks scientific rigor and rejects scientific methods and the use of empirical data in modelling economic behavior. Some economists describe Austrian methodology as being "<a href="A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">a priori</a>" or <a href="empirical">non-empirical</a>.

Economist <a href="Mark%20Blaug">Mark Blaug</a> has criticized over-reliance on methodological individualism, arguing it would rule out all macroeconomic propositions that cannot be reduced to microeconomic ones, and hence reject almost the whole of received macroeconomics.

Economist <a href="Thomas%20Mayer%20%28American%20economist%29">Thomas Mayer</a> has stated that Austrians advocate a rejection of the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a> which involves the development of empirically falsifiable <a href="Scientific%20theory%23Pedagogical%20definition">theories</a>. Furthermore, many supporters of using models of market behavior to analyze and test economic theory argue that economists have developed numerous experiments that elicit useful information about individual preferences.

Although economist Leland Yeager is sympathetic to Austrian economics, he rejects many favorite views of the Misesian group of Austrians, in particular, "the specifics of their business-cycle theory, ultra-subjectivism in value theory and particularly in interest-rate theory, their insistence on unidirectional causality rather than general interdependence, and their fondness for methodological brooding, pointless profundities, and verbal gymnastics."

Economist <a href="Paul%20A.%20Samuelson">Paul A. Samuelson</a> wrote in 1964 that most economists believe that economic conclusions reached by pure logical deduction are limited and weak. According to Samuelson and economist <a href="Bryan%20Caplan">Bryan Caplan</a>, Mises' deductive methodology also embraced by <a href="Murray%20Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> and to a lesser extent by Mises' student, Israel Kirzner was not sufficient in and of itself. Bryan Caplan wrote that the Austrian challenge to the realism of neoclassical assumptions helped work towards making those assumptions more plausible.

Mainstream economic research regarding <a href="Austrian%20business%20cycle%20theory">Austrian business cycle theory</a> finds that it is inconsistent with empirical evidence. Economists such as <a href="Gordon%20Tullock">Gordon Tullock</a>, <a href="Milton%20Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Krugman">Paul Krugman</a> have said that they regard the theory as incorrect. Austrian economist Ludwig Lachmann noted that the Austrian theory was rejected during the 1930s:
The promise of an Austrian theory of the trade cycle, which might also serve to explain the severity of the Great Depression, a feature of the early 1930s that provided the background for Hayek’s successful appearance on the London scene, soon proved deceptive. Three giants – Keynes, Knight and Sraffa – turned against the hapless Austrians who, in the middle of that black decade, thus had to do battle on three fronts. Naturally it proved a task beyond their strength.

Some economists argue that Austrian business cycle theory requires bankers and investors to exhibit a kind of irrationality, because the Austrian theory posits that investors will be fooled repeatedly (by temporarily low interest rates) into making unprofitable investment decisions. Bryan Caplan writes: "Why does Rothbard think businessmen are so incompetent at forecasting government policy? He credits them with entrepreneurial foresight about all market-generated conditions, but curiously finds them unable to forecast government policy, or even to avoid falling prey to simple accounting illusions generated by inflation and deflation.

Milton Friedman objected to the policy implications of the theory, stating the following in a 1998 interview:

I think the Austrian business-cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm. If you go back to the 1930s, which is a key point, here you had the Austrians sitting in London, Hayek and Lionel Robbins, and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world. You’ve just got to let it cure itself. You can’t do anything about it. You will only make it worse. You have Rothbard saying it was a great mistake not to let the whole banking system collapse. I think by encouraging that kind of do-nothing policy both in Britain and in the United States, they did harm.

In 1969, Milton Friedman, after examining the history of business cycles in the U.S., concluded that "The Hayek-Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence. It is, I believe, false." He analyzed the issue using newer data in 1993, and again reached the same conclusion. Referring to Friedman's discussion of the business cycle, Austrian economist Roger Garrison argued that Friedman's empirical findings are "broadly consistent with both Monetarist and Austrian views", and goes on to argue that although Friedman's model "describes the economy's performance at the highest level of aggregation; Austrian theory offers an insightful account of the market process that might underlie those aggregates."

Abscess

An abscess () is a collection of <a href="pus">pus</a> that has built up within the <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissue</a> of the body. Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness, pain, warmth, and swelling. The swelling may feel fluid-filled when pressed. The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling. <a href="Carbuncle">Carbuncle</a>s and <a href="boil">boil</a>s are types of abscess that often involve <a href="hair%20follicle">hair follicle</a>s, with carbuncles being larger.
They are usually caused by a <a href="bacterial%20infection">bacterial infection</a>. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is "<a href="methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</a>". Rarely, <a href="parasites">parasites</a> can cause abscesses; this is more common in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a>. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like, and is confirmed by cutting it open. <a href="Ultrasound">Ultrasound</a> imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the <a href="anus">anus</a>, <a href="computer%20tomography">computer tomography</a> (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.
Standard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage. There does not appear to be any benefit from also using <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s for this type of abscess in most people who are otherwise healthy. A small amount of evidence supports not packing the cavity that remains with <a href="Gauze%20sponge">gauze</a> after drainage. Closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning. Sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient.
Skin abscesses are common, and have become more common in recent years. Risk factors include <a href="intravenous%20drug%20use">intravenous drug use</a> with rates reported as high as 65% in this population. In 2005 in the United States, 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess. In Australia around 13,000 people were hospitalized in 2008 with the condition.

Abscesses may occur in any kind of solid tissue but most frequently on skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules (<a href="boil">boil</a>s) or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, <a href="brain%20abscess">brain</a>, <a href="Tooth%20abscess">teeth</a>, kidneys, and tonsils. Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues, and extensive regional tissue death (<a href="gangrene">gangrene</a>).

The main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function. There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills.

An internal abscess is more difficult to identify, but signs include pain in the affected area, a high temperature, and generally feeling unwell.
Internal abscesses rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated if such an abscess is suspected.
An abscess could potentially be fatal (although this is rare) if it compresses vital structures such as the <a href="Vertebrate%20trachea">trachea</a> in the context of a deep neck abscess.

If superficial, abscesses may be fluctuant when <a href="palpation">palpated</a>. This is a wave-like motion that is caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess.

Risk factors for abscess formation include <a href="intravenous%20drug%20use">intravenous drug use</a>. Another possible risk factor is a prior history of disc herniation or other spinal abnormality, though this has not been proven.

Abscesses are caused by <a href="bacterial%20infection">bacterial infection</a>, parasites, or foreign substances.
Bacterial infection is the most common cause. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is "<a href="methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</a>". Among spinal subdural abscesses, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism involved.

Rarely <a href="parasites">parasites</a> can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Specific parasites known to do this include <a href="dracunculiasis">dracunculiasis</a> and <a href="myiasis">myiasis</a>.

Surgery of the <a href="anal%20fistula">anal fistula</a> to drain an abscess treats the fistula and reduces likelihood of its recurrence and the need for repeated surgery. There is no evidence that <a href="fecal%20incontinence">fecal incontinence</a> is a consequence of this surgery for abscess drainage.

<a href="Perianal%20abscess">Perianal abscess</a>es can be seen in patients with for example <a href="inflammatory%20bowel%20disease">inflammatory bowel disease</a> (such as <a href="Crohn%27s%20disease">Crohn's disease</a>) or <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>. Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication. This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess. This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the <a href="anus">anus</a> which grows larger and more painful with time. Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and <a href="debridement">debridement</a> or <a href="Lancing%20%28surgical%20procedure%29">lancing</a>.

An "incisional abscess" is one that develops as a complication secondary to a <a href="surgical%20incision">surgical incision</a>. It presents as redness and warmth at the margins of the incision with purulent drainage from it. If the diagnosis is uncertain, the wound should be aspirated with a needle, with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for <a href="Gram%20stain">Gram stain</a> and <a href="bacterial%20culture">bacterial culture</a>.

An abscess is a <a href="immune%20system">defensive reaction</a> of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body.

The organisms or foreign materials kill the local <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a>, resulting in the release of <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s. The cytokines trigger an <a href="inflammation">inflammatory response</a>, which draws large numbers of <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s to the area and increases the regional blood flow.

The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.

An abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by pyogenic membrane. <a href="Ultrasound">Ultrasound</a> imaging in the emergency department can help in diagnosis.

Abscesses may be classified as either "skin abscesses" or "internal abscesses". Skin abscesses are common; internal abscesses tend to be harder to diagnose, and more serious. Skin abscesses are also called cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses.

For those with a history of intravenous drug use, an <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> is recommended before treatment to verify that no needle fragments are present. In this population if there is also a fever present <a href="infectious%20endocarditis">infectious endocarditis</a> should be considered.

Abscesses should be differentiated from <a href="empyema">empyema</a>s, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity.

Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms include: <a href="cellulitis">cellulitis</a>, a <a href="sebaceous%20cyst">sebaceous cyst</a> and <a href="necrotising%20fasciitis">necrotising fasciitis</a>. Cellulitis typically also has an erythematous reaction, but does not confer any purulent drainage.

The standard treatment for an uncomplicated skin or soft tissue abscess is opening and draining. There does not appear to be any benefit from also using <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s in most cases. A small amount of evidence did not find benefit from packing the abscess with gauze.

The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, which may require their removal. If foreign objects are not the cause, incising and draining the abscess is standard treatment.

In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort. The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the <a href="respiratory%20tract">respiratory tract</a>. Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.

Most people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics. Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of <a href="cellulitis">cellulitis</a>, symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing <a href="immunosuppression">immunosuppression</a>. People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics. If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.

In those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>" bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as <a href="flucloxacillin">flucloxacillin</a> or <a href="dicloxacillin">dicloxacillin</a> is used. The <a href="Infectious%20Diseases%20Society%20of%20America">Infectious Diseases Society of America</a> advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired <a href="Methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus"</a> (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective. Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include <a href="clindamycin">clindamycin</a>, <a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a>, <a href="minocycline">minocycline</a>, and <a href="trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>. The <a href="American%20College%20of%20Emergency%20Physicians">American College of Emergency Physicians</a> advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment. If the condition is thought to be <a href="cellulitis">cellulitis</a> rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. <a href="Antibiotic">Antibiotic</a> therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low <a href="pH">pH</a> levels.

<a href="Cell%20culture">Culturing the wound</a> is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage. Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.

In North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, bring more rapid healing, or lead to fewer physician visits.

More recently, several North American hospitals have opted for less-invasive loop drainage over standard drainage and wound packing. In one study of 143 pediatric outcomes, a failure rate of 1.4% was reported in the loop group versus 10.5% in the packing group (P<.030), while a separate study reported a 5.5% failure rate among loop patients.

Closing an abscess immediately after draining it appears to speed healing without increasing the risk of recurrence. This may not apply to anorectal abscesses. While they heal faster, there may be a higher rate of recurrence than those left open.

Even without treatment they rarely result in death as they will naturally break through the skin.

Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. Risk factors include <a href="intravenous%20drug%20use">intravenous drug use</a> with rates reported as high as 65% in this population. In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess. In Australia around 13,000 people were hospitalized in 2008 for the disease.

The <a href="Latin">Latin</a> medical <a href="aphorism">aphorism</a> ""<a href="ubi%20pus%2C%20ibi%20evacua">ubi pus, ibi evacua</a>"" expresses "where there is pus, there evacuate it" and is classical advice in the culture of Western medicine.

<a href="Needle%20exchange%20programmes">Needle exchange programmes</a> often administer or provide referrals for abscess treatment to <a href="injection%20drug%20users">injection drug users</a> as part of a <a href="harm%20reduction">harm reduction</a> public health strategy.

An abscess is so called because there is an "abscessus" (a going away or departure) of portions of the animal tissue from each other to make room for the suppurated matter lodged between them.

The word carbuncle is believed to have originated from the Latin: "carbunculus", originally a small coal; diminutive of "carbon-", "carbo": charcoal or ember, but also a <a href="carbuncle%20%28gemstone%29">carbuncle stone</a>, "precious stones of a red or fiery colour", usually <a href="garnet">garnet</a>s.

The following types of abscess are listed in the medical dictionary:

Aarhus

Aarhus (; officially spelled Århus from 1948 until 31 December 2010) is the second-largest city in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> and the seat of <a href="Aarhus%20municipality">Aarhus municipality</a>. It is located on the east coast of the <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, northwest of <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and north of <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. The inner <a href="urban%20area">urban area</a> contains 269,022 inhabitants () and the municipal population is 335,684 (). Aarhus is the central city in the <a href="East%20Jutland%20metropolitan%20area">East Jutland metropolitan area</a>, which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016.

The history of Aarhus began as a fortified <a href="Viking">Viking</a> settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the <a href="bishopric">bishopric</a> seated here from at least 948. The city was founded on the northern shores of <a href="F%C3%B6rden%20and%20East%20Jutland%20Fjorde">a fjord</a> at a <a href="natural%20harbour">natural harbour</a> and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products. <a href="Market%20town">Market town</a> privileges were granted in 1441, but growth stagnated in the 17th century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the <a href="Dano-Swedish%20War%20%281658%E2%80%9360%29">Swedish Wars</a>. In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the <a href="First%20Schleswig%20War">Schleswig Wars</a> but avoided destruction. As the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a> took hold, the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century.

Today Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade, services and industry in Jutland. The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, and as <a href="List%20of%20largest%20cities%20of%20the%20European%20Union%20by%20population%20within%20city%20limits">number 234</a> among <a href="world%20cities">world cities</a>. It is also a top 100 <a href="Meeting">conference</a> city in the world. Aarhus is the principal industrial <a href="port">port</a> of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>. Major Danish companies have based their headquarters here and people commute for work and leisure from a wide area in <a href="Region%20Midtjylland">Region Midtjylland</a>. It is a centre for research and education in the <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a> and home to <a href="Aarhus%20University">Aarhus University</a>, <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>'s largest university, including <a href="Aarhus%20University%20Hospital">Aarhus University Hospital</a> and <a href="INCUBA%20Science%20Park">INCUBA Science Park</a>. Being the Danish city with the youngest demographics, with 48,482 inhabitants aged under 18, Aarhus is also the second fastest growing Danish city, with an average growth of 4,500 people per annum since 2008.

Aarhus is known for its musical history. In the 1950s many <a href="jazz">jazz</a> clubs sprang up around the city, fuelled by the young population. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> and other genres. In the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became the centre for Denmark's rock music fostering many iconic bands such as <a href="TV-2%20%28band%29">TV-2</a> and <a href="Gnags">Gnags</a>. Aarhus is home to the annual eight-day <a href="Aarhus%20International%20Jazz%20Festival">Aarhus International Jazz Festival</a>, the <a href="Spot%20%28music%20festival%29">SPoT Festival</a> and the <a href="NorthSide%20Festival%20%28Denmark%29">NorthSide Festival</a>.

In 2017, Aarhus has been selected as <a href="European%20Capital%20of%20Culture">European Capital of Culture</a> along with <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a> in Cyprus. In August 2018, Aarhus will host the <a href="Sailing%20World%20Championships">Hempel Sailing World Championships</a>.

In <a href="Valdemar%27s%20Census%20Book">Valdemar's Census Book</a> (1231) the city was called "Arus", and in Icelandic it was known as "Aros", later written as Aars. It is a compound of the two words "ār", genitive of "ā" ("river", Modern Danish "å"), and "ōss" ("mouth", in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for "river delta"). The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of Aarhus Å (<a href="Aarhus%20River">Aarhus River</a>). The spelling "Aarhus" is first found in 1406 and gradually became the norm in the 17th century.

With the <a href="%C3%85%23Origin">Danish spelling reform of 1948</a>, "Aa" was changed to "Å". Some Danish cities resisted the new spelling of their names, notably <a href="Aalborg">Aalborg</a> and <a href="Aabenraa">Aabenraa</a>. Århus city council explicitly embraced the new spelling, as it was thought to enhance an image of progressiveness. In 2010, the city council voted to change the name from "Århus" to "Aarhus" in order to strengthen the international profile of the city. The renaming came into effect on 1 January 2011.

Certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city, such as the Aarhus River, changed from "Århus Å" to "Aarhus Å". It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter Å and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative. Whichever spelling local authorities choose, most newspapers and public institutions will accept it. Some official authorities such as the <a href="Dansk%20Sprogn%C3%A6vn">Danish Language Committee</a>, publisher of the <a href="Retskrivningsordbogen">Danish Orthographic Dictionary</a>, still retain "Århus" as the main name, providing "Aarhus" as a new, second option, in brackets.

Founded in the early <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a>, Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, along with <a href="Ribe">Ribe</a> and <a href="Hedeby">Hedeby</a>.

Archaeological evidence under the Aros settlement's defences indicate the site was a town as early as the last quarter of the 8th century, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried <a href="longhouse">longhouse</a>s, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.

The centre of Aarhus was once a <a href="Germanic%20paganism">pagan burial site</a> until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of <a href="Frode">Frode</a>, King of Jutland, around 900. In the 900s an earth rampart for the defence of the early city was constructed, encircling the settlement, much like the defence structures found at <a href="Viking%20ring%20fortress">Viking ring fortress</a>es elsewhere. The rampart was later reinforced by <a href="Harald%20Bluetooth">Harald Bluetooth</a>, and together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military centre. There are strong indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in <a href="Viby%20J">Viby</a>, a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.

The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 948 when <a href="Adam%20of%20Bremen">Adam of Bremen</a> reported the bishop <a href="Reginbrand">Reginbrand</a> attended the <a href="synod%20of%20Ingelheim">synod of Ingelheim</a> in Germany. The bishopric and the town's geographical location propelled prosperous growth and development of the early medieval town. The finding of six <a href="runestone">runestone</a>s in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000, as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them. The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city, such as <a href="Harald%20Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a>'s assault around 1050, when the Holy Trinity Church was burned to the ground.

The growing influence of the Church during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the city; notably <a href="Aarhus%20Cathedral">Aarhus Cathedral</a> was initiated in the late 12th century by the influential bishop <a href="Peder%20Vognsen">Peder Vognsen</a>. In 1441, <a href="Christopher%20III">Christopher III</a> issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the 12th century. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.

The official and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were abandoned to accommodate expansion. Parts of the ramparts are still in existence today and can be experienced as steep slopes at the riverside and they have also survived in some place names of the inner city, including the streets of <a href="Volden%2C%20Aarhus">Volden</a> (The Rampart) and <a href="Graven%2C%20Aarhus">Graven</a> (The Moat). Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early 16th century. In 1657, <a href="octroi">octroi</a> was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades. Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling, with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares, <a href="Mejlgade">Mejlgade</a> and <a href="Studsgade">Studsgade</a>. The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where <a href="merchant">merchant</a> quarters were built.

In the 17th century, Aarhus entered a period of recession as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the <a href="Dano-Swedish%20War%20%281658%E2%80%9360%29">Swedish wars</a> and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state. It was not until the middle of the 18th century growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural <a href="catchment%20area">catchment area</a>s around the city; particularly <a href="grain">grain</a> proved to be a remunerative export. The first factories were established at this time as the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a> reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.

Following the <a href="Napoleonic%20wars">Napoleonic wars</a>, Denmark lost Norway and was excluded from international trade for some years which caused a recession for Aarhus' trade-based economy that lasted until the 1830s. The economy turned around as the <a href="History%20of%20Denmark%23Industrialisation">industrial revolution</a> reached the city and factories with steam-driven machinery became more productive.

In 1838, the electoral laws were reformed leading to elections for the 15 seats on the city council. The rules were initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run. In the 1844 elections only 174 citizens qualified out of a total population of more than 7,000. The first city council, mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the <a href="Aarhus%20River">Aarhus River</a>. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the city council, as it is to this day.
During the <a href="First%20Schleswig%20War">First Schleswig War</a> Aarhus was occupied by German troops from 21 June to 24 July 1849. The city was spared any fighting, but in <a href="Vejlby">Vejlby</a> north of the city a cavalry skirmish known as <a href="Skirmish%20of%20%C3%85rhus">Rytterfægtningen</a> took place which stopped the German advance through Jutland. The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets, particularly in <a href="Frederiksbjerg">Frederiksbjerg</a>, are named after Danish officers of the time. Fifteen years later, in 1864, the city was occupied again, this time for seven months, during the <a href="Second%20Schleswig%20War">Second Schleswig War</a>.

In spite of wars and occupation the city continued to develop. In 1851 <a href="octroi">octroi</a> was abolished and the city walls were removed to provide easier access for trade. Regular <a href="steamship">steamship</a> links with Copenhagen had begun in 1830 and in 1862 Jutland's first railway was established between Aarhus and <a href="Randers">Randers</a>.
In the second half of the 19th century industrialisation came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The <a href="Ceres%20Brewery">Ceres Brewery</a> was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: "the Ceres-grounds"). In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created <a href="Korn-%20og%20Foderstof%20Kompagniet">Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet</a> (KFK), focused on grain and <a href="Animal%20feed">feedstuffs</a>. KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today. <a href="Otto%20M%C3%B8nsted">Otto Mønsted</a> created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on <a href="butter">butter</a> export to England, China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish margarine factory. The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre. Other new factories of note included the <a href="dockyard">dockyard</a> <a href="Aarhus%20Flydedok">Aarhus Flydedok</a>, the <a href="oil%20mill">oil mill</a> <a href="Aarhus%20Oliefabrik%20A/S">Århus Oliefabrik</a> and the <a href="ironworks">ironworks</a> <a href="Frichs">Frichs</a>.

Aarhus became the largest provincial city in the country by the turn of the century and the city marketed itself as the "Capital of Jutland". The population increased from 15,000 in 1870 to 52,000 in 1901 and, in response, the city annexed large land areas to develop new residential quarters such as <a href="Tr%C3%B8jborg">Trøjborg</a>, <a href="Frederiksbjerg">Frederiksbjerg</a> and <a href="Marselisborg">Marselisborg</a>. Many of its cultural institutions were also established at this time such as <a href="Aarhus%20Theatre">Aarhus Theatre</a> (1900), the <a href="State%20and%20University%20Library%2C%20Denmark">State Library</a> (1902), <a href="Aarhus%20University">Aarhus University</a> (1928) and several hospitals.

On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark, occupying Aarhus the following day and 5 years hence. The occupation was a destructive period with major disasters, loss of life and economic depression. The <a href="Port%20of%20Aarhus">Port of Aarhus</a> became a hub for supplies to the <a href="Baltics">Baltics</a> and <a href="Norway">Norway</a> while the surrounding rail network supplied the <a href="Atlantic%20Wall">Atlantic Wall</a> in west Jutland and cargo headed for Germany. Combined, these factors resulted in a strong German presence, especially in 1944–45. The first years were peaceful in conjunction with the policies of the Danish <a href="Denmark%20in%20World%20War%20II%23Protectorate%20Government%201940%E2%80%9343">Protectorate Government</a>, but following the enactment of the <a href="Communist%20Law">Communist Law</a> in August 1941, the first armed resistance and sabotage commenced, gradually growing in intensity over the years with repression and terror in response.

Small, independent <a href="Danish%20resistance%20movement">resistance groups</a> first appeared in 1941–42 but the first to coordinate with the <a href="Danish%20Freedom%20Council">Freedom Council</a> was the <a href="Samsing%20Group">Samsing Group</a>, responsible for most operations from early 1943. The Samsing group, along with others in and around Aarhus, was dismantled in June 1944 when <a href="Grethe%20Bartram">Grethe "Thora" Bartram</a> turned her family and acquaintances over to German authorities. In response, requests for assistance was sent to contacts in <a href="England">England</a> and in October 1944 the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> <a href="Aarhus%20Air%20Raid">bombed the Gestapo headquarters</a> successfully destroying archives and obstructing the ongoing investigation. The <a href="5%20Kolonne">5 Kolonne</a> group was established with assistance from <a href="Holger%20Danske%20%28resistance%20group%29">Holger Danske</a> to restore a resistance movement in Aarhus along with the <a href="L-groups">L-groups</a>, tasked with assassinating collaborators. Resistance operations escalated from mid-1944 with most major sabotage operations and assassinations occurring in the period 1944–45. The growing resistance was countered with 19 <a href="Schalburgtage">Schalburgtage</a> terror operations by the <a href="Peter%20group">Peter Group</a> from August 1944, including large-scale fire bombings and murders. The increasingly destructive occupation was compounded when an <a href="1944%20explosion%20in%20Aarhus">ammunition barge exploded</a> in 1944, destroying much of the harbor and damaging the inner city. On 5 May 1945 German forces in Denmark surrendered but during the transitional period fighting broke out in Aarhus between the resistance and German soldiers resulting in 22 dead. Order was restored by the end of the day and on 8 May the British <a href="1st%20The%20Royal%20Dragoons">Royal Dragoons</a> entered the city.

In the 1980s the city entered a period of rapid growth and the service sector overtook trade, industry and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time. Workers gradually began commuting to the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education. The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; <a href="Gaffa%20%28magazine%29">Gaffa</a> and the <a href="KaosPilot">KaosPilot</a> school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as <a href="TV-2%20%28band%29">TV2</a>, <a href="Gnags">Gnags</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Helmig">Thomas Helmig</a>, <a href="Bamses%20Venner">Bamses Venner</a>, <a href="Anne%20Dorte%20Michelsen">Anne Dorte Michelsen</a>, <a href="Mek%20Pek">Mek Pek</a> and <a href="Shit%20%26amp%3B%20Chanel">Shit & Chanel</a>.

Since the turn of the millennium both skyline and land use has changed as former industrial sites are being redeveloped into new city districts. Starting in 2007, the former docklands are being converted to a new mixed use district dubbed "Aarhus Ø" (<a href="Aarhus%20Docklands">Aarhus Docklands</a>). The site of the former <a href="Royal%20Unibrew">Royal Unibrew</a> <a href="Ceres%20Brewery">Ceres breweries</a> began redevelopment in 2012 into "<a href="CeresByen">CeresByen</a>", a residential district with educational institutions. The former <a href="DSB%20%28railway%20company%29">DSB</a> repair facilities at Frederiks Plads have been demolished and are being developed into a new business district with high-rise buildings scheduled for completion in 2017. The main bus terminal is planned to be moved to the central railway station by 2018 and the current site will be made into a new residential district. Construction of the first <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> system in the city commenced in 2013, with the first increment to be finished in 2017. The light rail system is planned to eventually tie many of the suburbs closer to central Aarhus. The next phase will connect a large planned suburb west of <a href="Lisbjerg">Lisbjerg</a>.

Accelerating growth since the early 2000s brought the inner urban area to roughly 260,000 inhabitants by 2014. The rapid growth is expected to continue until at least 2030 when Aarhus municipality has set an ambitious target for 375,000 inhabitants.

Aarhus is located at the <a href="Bay%20of%20Aarhus">Bay of Aarhus</a> facing the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> sea in the east with the peninsulas of <a href="Mols">Mols</a> and <a href="Helgen%C3%A6s">Helgenæs</a> across the bay to the northeast. Mols and Helgenæs are both part of the larger regional peninsula of <a href="Djursland">Djursland</a>. A number of larger cities and towns is within easy reach from Aarhus by road and rail, including <a href="Randers">Randers</a> ( by road north), <a href="Gren%C3%A5">Grenå</a> (northeast), <a href="Horsens">Horsens</a> ( south) and <a href="Silkeborg">Silkeborg</a> ( east).

At Aarhus' location, the Bay of Aarhus provides a natural harbour with a depth of quite close to the shore. Aarhus was founded at the mouth of a brackish water <a href="F%C3%B6rden%20and%20East%20Jutland%20Fjorde">fjord</a>, but the original fjord no longer exists, as it has gradually narrowed into what is now the <a href="Aarhus%20River">Aarhus River</a> and the <a href="Brabrand%20Lake">Brabrand Lake</a>, due to natural <a href="Sediment%20transport%23Fluvial">sedimentation</a>. The land around Aarhus was once covered by forests, remains of which exist in parts of <a href="Marselisborg%20Forest">Marselisborg Forest</a> to the south and <a href="Riis%20Skov">Riis Skov</a> to the north. Several lakes extend west from the inner city as the landscape merges with the larger region of <a href="S%C3%B8h%C3%B8jlandet">Søhøjlandet</a> with heights exceeding at <a href="Himmelbjerget">Himmelbjerget</a> between <a href="Skanderborg">Skanderborg</a> and <a href="Silkeborg">Silkeborg</a>.

The hilly area around Aarhus consists of a <a href="moraine">moranial plateau</a> from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of <a href="tunnel%20valley">tunnel valley</a>s. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake and the <a href="Eg%C3%A5">Egå Valley</a> to the north, with the stream of <a href="Eg%C3%A5">Egå</a>en, the bog of <a href="Geding-Kasted%20Mose">Geding-Kasted Mose</a> and Geding Lake. Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, but in the early 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbygård Å in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the <a href="quaternary">pre-quaternary</a>. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late <a href="glacial%20meltwater%20valley">glacial meltwater valley</a>s. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow <a href="tertiary">tertiary</a> clay from the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> and <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> (57 to 24 million years ago).

Aarhus is in the <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a> zone (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a>: "Dfb") and the weather is influenced by <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure systems</a> from the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.

Western winds from the Atlantic and <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> are dominant resulting in more precipitation in western Denmark. In addition, Jutland rises sufficiently in the centre to lift air to higher, colder altitudes contributing to increased precipitation in eastern Jutland. Combined these factors make east and south Jutland comparatively wetter than other parts of the country. Average temperature over the year is with February being the coldest month (0.1 °C) and August the warmest ( ). Temperatures in the sea can reach in June to August, but it is not uncommon for beaches to register locally.

The geography in the area affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. <a href="Brabrand%20Lake">Brabrand Lake</a> to the west further contributes to this effect and as a result the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining <a href="boulder%20clay">boulder clay</a>. These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.

Because of the northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes.

Aarhus is the seat of Aarhus Municipality and Aarhus City Council ("Aarhus Byråd") is also the municipal government. The <a href="Mayor">Mayor</a> of Aarhus until 2017 is <a href="Jacob%20Bundsgaard">Jacob Bundsgaard</a> of the <a href="Social%20Democrats%20%28Denmark%29">Social Democrats</a>. Municipal elections are held every fourth year on the third Tuesday of November. The city council consists of 31 members elected for four-year terms. When an election has determined the composition of the council, it elects a mayor, two deputy mayors and five <a href="alderman">aldermen</a> from their ranks. Anyone who is eligible to vote and who resides within the municipality can run for a seat on the city council provided they can secure endorsements and signatures from 50 inhabitants of the municipality.

The first publicly elected mayor of Aarhus was appointed in 1919. In the <a href="1970%20Danish%20Municipal%20Reform">1970 Danish Municipal Reform</a> the current Aarhus municipality was created by merging 20 municipalities. Aarhus was the seat of <a href="Aarhus%20County">Aarhus County</a> until the 2007 Danish municipal reform, which substituted the Danish counties with five regions and replaced Aarhus County with <a href="Central%20Denmark%20Region">Central Denmark Region</a> ("Region Midtjylland"), seated in <a href="Viborg%2C%20Denmark">Viborg</a>.

Aarhus Municipality has 45 <a href="electoral%20wards">electoral wards</a> and <a href="polling%20station">polling station</a>s in four <a href="electoral%20districts">electoral districts</a> for the <a href="Folketing">Folketing</a> (national Parliament). The <a href="diocese%20of%20Aarhus">diocese of Aarhus</a> has four <a href="deanery">deaneries</a> composed of 60 <a href="parish">parish</a>es within Aarhus municipality. Aarhus municipality contains 21 <a href="Postal%20code">postal districts</a> and some parts of another 9. The urban area of Aarhus and the immediate suburbs are divided into the districts <a href="Aarhus%20C">Aarhus C</a>, <a href="Aarhus%20N">Aarhus N</a>, <a href="Aarhus%20V">Aarhus V</a>, <a href="Viby%20J">Viby J</a>, <a href="H%C3%B8jbjerg">Højbjerg</a> and <a href="Brabrand">Brabrand</a>.

Aarhus has increasingly been investing in <a href="environmental%20planning">environmental planning</a> and, in accordance with national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a>s for heating by 2030. The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015 the municipality took over 3 private <a href="straw">straw</a>-fired heating plants and the year after a new 77 <a href="Megawatt">MW</a> <a href="combined%20heat%20and%20power">combined heat and power</a> biomass plant at <a href="Lisbjerg%20Power%20Station">Lisbjerg Power Station</a> was completed while <a href="Studstrup%20Power%20Station">Studstrup Power Station</a> finished a refit to move from <a href="coal">coal</a> to wood chips. In conjunction with the development of the <a href="Aarhus%20Docklands">Docklands district</a> there are plans for a utility scale seawater <a href="heat%20pump">heat pump</a> which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the <a href="district%20heating">district heating</a> system.
The municipality aims for a coherent and holistic administration of the <a href="water%20cycle">water cycle</a> to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage <a href="green%20growth">green growth</a> and self-sufficiency. The main issues are <a href="nutrient%20pollution">excessive nutrients</a>, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested in a number of large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes <a href="Brabrand%20Lake">Årslev Engsø</a> and <a href="Eg%C3%A5%20Engs%C3%B8">Egå Engsø</a> were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage treatment</a> plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025. The treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are planned to take over all waste treatment and have been refitted for <a href="biogas">biogas</a> production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new systems, sewage and <a href="stormwater">stormwater</a> throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into different systems by 2085.

<a href="Afforestation">Afforestation</a> projects have been undertaken to prevent <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> pollution, secure drinking water, <a href="carbon%20sequestration">sequester CO2</a>, increase <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the <a href="New%20Forests%20of%20Aarhus">New Forests of Aarhus</a>, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realized as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a <a href="rewilding%20%28conservation%20biology%29">rewilding</a> effort in <a href="Geding-Kasted%20Mose">Geding-Kasted Bog</a> and continuous monitoring of the four <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a> areas in the municipality.

Aarhus has a population of 261,570 on for a density of 2,874/km (7,444/sq mi). Aarhus municipality has a population of 330,639 on 468 km with a density of 706/km (1,829/sq mi). Less than a fifth of the municipal population resides beyond city limits and almost all live in an urban area. The population of Aarhus is both younger and better-educated than the national average which can be attributed to the high concentration of educational institutions. More than 40% of the population have an academic degree while only some 14% have no secondary education or trade. The largest age group is 20- to 29-year-olds and the average age is 37.5, making it the youngest city in the country and one of its youngest municipalities. Women have slightly outnumbered men for many years.

The city is home to 75 different religious groups and denominations most of which are Christian or Muslim with a smaller number of Buddhist and Hindu communities. Since the 1990s there has been a marked growth in diverse new spiritual groups although the total number of followers remains small. The majority of the population are members of the Protestant state church, <a href="Church%20of%20Denmark">Church of Denmark</a>, which is by far the largest religious institution both in the city and the country as a whole. Some 20% of the population are not officially affiliated with any religion, a percentage that has been slowly rising for many years.

Aarhus has the highest ratio of immigrants in Denmark, 14.8% of the population, outside the Copenhagen area. During the 1990s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in recent years, there has been high growth in the overall immigrant community, from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008. The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and north Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.

Many immigrants have established themselves in <a href="Brabrand">Brabrand</a>, <a href="Hasle%2C%20Aarhus">Hasle</a> and <a href="Viby%20J">Viby</a>, where the percentage of inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000. This has resulted in several 'especially vulnerable residential areas' (a.k.a. <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>s), with <a href="Gellerup">Gellerup</a> as the most notable neighbourhood. In Brabrand and Gellerup, two thirds of the population now have a non-Danish ethnic background. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including <a href="Bazar%20Vest">Bazar Vest</a>, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.

The economy of Aarhus is predominantly knowledge and service based, strongly influenced by the <a href="University%20of%20Aarhus">University of Aarhus</a> and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 in the private sector and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major <a href="agriculture">agricultural producer</a>, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus from as far away as <a href="Randers">Randers</a>, <a href="Silkeborg">Silkeborg</a> and <a href="Skanderborg">Skanderborg</a> and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a center for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many specialty shops.

The job market is knowledge and service based and the largest employment sectors are healthcare and social services, trade, education, consulting, research, industry and telecommunications. The municipality has more high and middle income jobs, and fewer low income jobs, than the national average. Today the majority of the largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade, transport and media. The wind power industry has strong roots in Aarhus, and the larger region of <a href="Midtjylland">Midtjylland</a>, and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area. The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy. The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium-sized companies mainly focused on research and development.

Several major companies have their headquarters in Aarhus such as <a href="Arla%20Foods">Arla Foods</a>, one of the largest dairy groups in Europe, <a href="Dansk%20Supermarked%20A/S">Dansk Supermarked</a>, Denmark's largest retailer, <a href="Jysk%20%28store%29">Jysk</a>, a worldwide retailer specializing in household goods, bedding, furniture and interior design, <a href="Vestas">Vestas</a>, one of the major wind turbine producers worldwide, and several leading retail companies. In total four of the 10 largest companies in the country are based in the municipality. Since the early 2000s the city has experienced an influx of larger companies moving from other parts of the Jutland peninsula. Other large employers of note include Krifa (a <a href="trades%20union">trades union</a> organisation) and 5R, a <a href="telemarketing">telemarketing</a> company, while metallurgy and electronics remain important sectors.

The Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in <a href="northern%20Europe">northern Europe</a> with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world. It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5 million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while <a href="animal%20feed">feedstuff</a>s, stone, cement and <a href="coal">coal</a> are among the chief imports. Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the <a href="Port%20of%20Hamburg">Port of Hamburg</a> and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008.

The ferry terminal presents the only alternative to the <a href="Great%20Belt%20Link">Great Belt Link</a> for passenger transport between Jutland and <a href="Zealand">Zealand</a>. It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830. Currently <a href="Mols-Linien">Mols-Linien</a> operates the route and annually transports some 2 million passengers and a million vehicles. Additional <a href="roll-on/roll-off">roll-on/roll-off</a> cargo ferries serve <a href="Finland">Finland</a> and <a href="Kalundborg">Kalundborg</a> on a weekly basis and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals. Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>.

The <a href="ARoS%20Aarhus%20Kunstmuseum">ARoS Art Museum</a>, the <a href="The%20Old%20Town%2C%20Aarhus">Old Town Museum</a> and <a href="Tivoli%20Friheden">Tivoli Friheden</a> are among Denmark's <a href="List%20of%20tourist%20attractions%20in%20Denmark">top tourist attractions</a>. With a combined total of almost 1.4 million visitors they represent the driving force behind tourism but other venues such as <a href="Moesg%C3%A5rd%20Museum">Moesgård Museum</a> and <a href="Kvindemuseet">Kvindemuseet</a> are also popular. The city's extensive shopping facilities are also said to be a major attraction for tourists, as are festivals, especially <a href="NorthSide%20Festival%20%28Denmark%29">NorthSide</a> and <a href="Spot%20%28music%20festival%29">SPOT</a>. Many visitors arrive on cruise ships: in 2012, 18 vessels visited the port with over 38,000 passengers.

In the 2010s there has been a significant expansion of tourist facilities, culminating in the opening of the 240-room Comwell Hotel in July 2014, which increased the number of hotel rooms in the city by 25%. Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as 750,000 a year, most of them Danes from other regions, the remainder coming mainly from Norway, Sweden, northern Germany and the United Kingdom. Overall, they spend about DKK 3 billion ($540 million) in the city each year. The primary motivation for tourists choosing Aarhus as a destination is experiencing the city and culture, family and couples vacation or as a part of a round trip in Denmark. The average stay is little more than three days on average.

There are more than 30 tourist information spots across the city, some of them staffed, while others are on-line, publicly accessible touch screens. The official tourist information service in Aarhus is organised under VisitAaarhus, a corporate foundation initiated in 1994 by Aarhus Municipality and local commercial interest organisations.

The largest research park in Aarhus is <a href="INCUBA%20Science%20Park">INCUBA Science Park</a>, focused on <a href="IT">IT</a> and <a href="biomedical%20research">biomedical research</a>, It is based on Denmark's first research park, "Forskerpark Aarhus" (Research Park Aarhus), founded in 1986, which in 2007 merged with another research park to form INCUBA Science Park. The organization is owned partly by <a href="Aarhus%20University">Aarhus University</a> and private investors and aims to foster close relationships between public institutions and startup companies. It is physically divided across 4 locations after a new department was inaugurated in <a href="Navitas">Navitas Park</a> in 2015, which it will share with the <a href="Aarhus%20School%20of%20Marine%20and%20Technical%20Engineering">Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering</a> and <a href="AU%20Engineering">AU Engineering</a>. Another major center for knowledge is <a href="Agro%20Food%20Park">Agro Food Park</a> in <a href="Skejby">Skejby</a>, established to facilitate cooperation between companies and public institutions working within food science and agriculture. In January 2017 <a href="Arla%20Foods">Arla Foods</a> will open the global innovation center "Arla Nativa" in Agro Food Park and in 2018 Aarhus University is moving the "Danish Centre for Food and Agriculture" there as well. In 2016 some 1000 people worked at Agro Food Park, spread across 50 companies and institutions and in August 2016 Agro Food Park management published plans to expand facilities from 92.000 m to .

In addition, Aarhus is home to the <a href="Aarhus%20School%20of%20Architecture">Aarhus School of Architecture</a>, one of two Danish <a href="Ministry%20of%20Science%2C%20Innovation%20and%20Higher%20Education%20%28Denmark%29">Ministry of Education</a> institutions that provide degree programs in architecture, and some of the largest architecture firms in the <a href="Nordic%20Countries">Nordic Countries</a> such as <a href="schmidt%20hammer%20lassen%20architects">schmidt hammer lassen architects</a>, <a href="Arkitema%20Architects">Arkitema Architects</a> and <a href="C.%20F.%20M%C3%B8ller%20Architects">C. F. Møller Architects</a>. Taken together these organizations form a unique concentration of expertise and knowledge in architecture outside Copenhagen which the "Danish Ministry of Business and Growth" refer to as "arkitekturklyngen" (the architecture cluster). To promote the "cluster" the School of Architecture will be given new school buildings centrally in the new <a href="Aarhus%20Godsbaneg%C3%A5rd">Freight Station Neighborhood</a>, planned for development in the 2020s. In the interim the city council supports a culture, business and education center in the area which may continue in the future neighborhood in some form. The future occupants of the neighborhood will be businesses and organizations selected for their ability to be involved in the local community and it is hoped the area will evolve into a hotspot for creativity and design.

Aarhus has developed in stages, from the Viking age to modern times, all visible in the city today. Many architectural styles are represented in different parts of the city such as <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a>, <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a>, <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a>, <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a>, <a href="National%20Romantic%20Style">National Romantic</a>, <a href="Nordic%20Classicism">Nordic classicism</a>, <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical</a>, <a href="empire%20style">Empire</a> and <a href="Functionalism%20%28architecture%29">Functionalism</a>. The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the harbour and later the railway station and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.

The streets <a href="Volden%2C%20Aarhus">Volden</a> (The Rampart) and <a href="Graven%2C%20Aarhus">Graven</a> (The Moat) testify to the defences of the initial Viking settlement and "Allégaderingen" in <a href="Midtbyen%2C%20Aarhus">Midtbyen</a> roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network in the <a href="Midtbyen%20%28Aarhus%29">inner city</a> formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. "Vesterport" (Westward Gate) still bears the name of a medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways "Posthussmøgen" and "Telefonsmøgen" are remnants of toll stations from that time. The inner city has the oldest preserved houses, especially the <a href="Latinerkvarteret%2C%20Aarhus">Latin Quarter</a>, with buildings dating back to the early 17th century in <a href="Mejlgade">Mejlgade</a> and <a href="Skolegade">Skolegade</a>. Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in <a href="Klostergade">Klostergade</a>, <a href="Studsgade">Studsgade</a> and Skolegade.

<a href="Aarhus%20Cathedral">Aarhus Cathedral</a> ("Århus Domkirke") in the centre of Aarhus, is the longest and tallest church in Denmark at and in length and height respectively. Originally built as a <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> basilica in the 13th century, it was rebuilt and enlarged as a <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> cathedral in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Even though the cathedral stood finished around 1300, it took more than a century to build; the associated cathedral school of "<a href="Aarhus%20Katedralskole">Aarhus Katedralskole</a>" was already founded in 1195 and ranks as the <a href="List%20of%20the%20oldest%20schools%20in%20the%20world%23">44th oldest school in the world</a>. Another important and historic church in the inner city, is the <a href="Church%20of%20Our%20Lady%20%28Aarhus%29">Church of our Lady</a> ("Vor Frue Kirke") also from the 13th century in Romanesque and Gothic style. It is smaller and less impressive, but it was the first cathedral of Aarhus and founded on an even older church constructed in 1060; the oldest stone church in Scandinavia. Parts of this former church were excavated in the 1950s and can now be experienced as a crypt beneath the nave of "Vor Frue Kirke". <a href="Langelandsgade%20Kaserne">Langelandsgade Kaserne</a> in <a href="National%20Romantic%20Style">National Romantic style</a> from 1889 is the oldest former military barracks left in the country; home to the university Department of Aesthetics and Communication since 1989.

<a href="Marselisborg%20Palace">Marselisborg Palace</a> ("Marselisborg Slot"), designed by <a href="Hack%20Kampmann">Hack Kampmann</a> in <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical</a> and <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> styles, was donated by the city to <a href="Christian%20X">Prince Christian</a> and <a href="Alexandrine%20of%20Mecklenburg-Schwerin">Princess Alexandrine</a> as a wedding present in 1898. The <a href="Aarhus%20Custom%20House">Aarhus Custom House</a> ("Toldkammeret") from 1898, is said to be Hack Kampmann's finest work.

<a href="Tivoli%20Friheden">Tivoli Friheden</a> (Tivoli Freedom) opened in 1903 and has since been the largest amusement park in the city and a tourist attraction. <a href="Aarhus%20Theatre">Aarhus Theatre</a> from 1916 in the Art Nouveau style is the largest provincial theatre in Denmark. The early buildings of <a href="Aarhus%20University">Aarhus University</a>, especially the main building completed in 1932, designed by <a href="Kay%20Fisker">Kay Fisker</a>, <a href="Povl%20Stegmann">Povl Stegmann</a> and by <a href="C.F.%20M%C3%B8ller">C.F. Møller</a> have gained an international reputation for their contribution to <a href="functionalism%20%28architecture%29">functionalist architecture</a>. The <a href="Aarhus%20City%20Hall">City Hall</a> ("Aarhus Rådhus") from 1941 with an iconic tower clad in marble, was designed by <a href="Arne%20Jacobsen">Arne Jacobsen</a> and <a href="Erik%20M%C3%B8ller">Erik Møller</a> in a modern Functionalist style.

Aarhus is home to many annual cultural events and festivals, museums, theatres, and sport events of both national and international importance, and presents some of the largest cultural attractions in Denmark. There is a long tradition here in music of all genres and many Danish bands have emerged from Aarhus. Libraries, cultural centres and educational institutions present free or easy opportunities for the citizens to participate in, engage in, or be creative with cultural events and productions of all kinds.

Since 1938, Aarhus has marketed itself as "Smilets by" (City of smiles) which has become both an informal moniker and official slogan. In 2011, the city council opted to change the slogan to "Aarhus. Danish for Progress" but it was unpopular and abandoned after just a few years. Other slogans that have occasionally been used are "Byen ved havet" (City by the sea), "Mellem bugt og bøgeskov" (Between bay and beechwood) and "Verdens mindste storby" (World's smallest big city). Aarhus is featured in popular musical numbers such as "Hjem til Aarhus" by <a href="P%C3%A5%20Slaget%2012">På Slaget 12</a>, "Lav sol over Aarhus" by <a href="Gnags">Gnags</a>, "8000 Aarhus C" by <a href="Flemming%20J%C3%B8rgensen">Flemming Jørgensen</a>, "Pigen ud af Aarhus" by <a href="Tina%20Dickow">Tina Dickow</a> and "Slingrer ned ad Vestergade" by <a href="Gnags">Gnags</a>. In 1919, the number "Sangen til Aarhus" (Song to Aarhus) had become a popular hit for a time, but the oldest and perhaps best known "national anthem" for the city is the classical "Aarhus Tappenstreg" from 1872 by <a href="Carl%20Christian%20M%C3%B8ller">Carl Christian Møller</a> which is occasionally played at official events or at performances by local marching bands and orchestras.

Aarhus has a range of museums, including <a href="List%20of%20tourist%20attractions%20in%20Denmark">two of the largest</a> in the country measured by the number of visitors, "<a href="Den%20Gamle%20By">Den Gamle By</a>" and "<a href="ARoS%20Aarhus%20Kunstmuseum">ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum</a>".
"Den Gamle By" (The Old Town), officially "Danmarks Købstadmuseum" (Denmark's Market Town Museum), presents Danish townscapes from the 16th century to the 1970s with individual areas focused on different time periods. 75 historic buildings collected from different parts of the country have been brought here to create a small town in its own right.
ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum, the city's main art museum is one of the largest art museums in Scandinavia with a collection covering Danish art from the 18th century to the present day as well as paintings, installations and sculptures representing international <a href="art%20movement">art movement</a>s and artists from all over the world. The iconic glass structure on the roof, "Your Rainbow Panorama", was designed by <a href="Olafur%20Eliasson">Olafur Eliasson</a> and features a promenade offering a colourful panorama of the city.

Strictly speaking it is not a museum but an <a href="arts%20centre">arts centre</a>, and one of the oldest in Europe, built and founded in 1917.

Libraries in Denmark are also cultural and community centres. They play an active role in the cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of <a href="Dokk1">Dokk1</a> opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a local library engaged in similar cultural and educational activities, but on a more local scale.

There are also several cultural and community centres scattered throughout the city. This includes Folkestedet in the central <a href="%C3%85parken">Åparken</a>, facilitating events for and by non-commercial associations, organisations and clubs, and activities for the elderly, the nearby <a href="Godsbanen">Godsbanen</a> at the railway yard, with workshops, events and exhibitions, and Globus1 in <a href="Brabrand">Brabrand</a> facilitating sports and various cultural activities. The <a href="State%20and%20University%20Library%2C%20Denmark">State Library</a> ("Statsbiblioteket") at the university campus has status of a <a href="national%20library">national library</a>. The city is a member of the ICORN organisation (<a href="International%20Cities%20of%20Refuge%20Network">International Cities of Refuge Network</a>) in an effort to provide a safe haven to authors and writers persecuted in their countries of origin.

The city enjoys strong musical traditions, both classical and alternative, underground and popular, with educational and performance institutions such as the concert halls of <a href="Musikhuset%20Aarhus">Musikhuset</a>, the opera of <a href="Den%20Jyske%20Opera">Den Jyske Opera</a>, <a href="Aarhus%20Symfoniorkester">Aarhus Symfoniorkester</a> (Aarhus Symphony Orchestra) and <a href="Det%20Jyske%20Musikkonservatorium">Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium</a> (Royal Academy of Music, Aarhus/Aalborg).

The outdoor <a href="Gr%C3%B8n%20Koncert">Grøn Koncert</a> music festival takes place every year in many cities across Denmark, including Aarhus. <a href="Danmarks%20grimmeste%20festival">Danmarks grimmeste festival</a> (lit. Denmark's ugliest Festival) is a small summer music festival held in <a href="Skjoldh%C3%B8jkilen">Skjoldhøjkilen</a>, <a href="Brabrand">Brabrand</a>.

Aarhus also hosts recurring events dedicated to specific art genres. International Living theatre (ILT) is a bi-annual festival established in 2009, but with <a href="performing%20arts">performing arts</a> and stage art on a broad scale. The festival has a vision of showing the best plays and stage art experiences of the world, by presenting the best stage art companies of the world, while at the same time attracting stage art interested people from both Aarhus and Europe at large.

Notable events of a local scope include the <a href="Aarhus%20University">university</a> boat-race, held in the University Park since 1991, which has become a local spectator event attracting some 20,000 people. The boat race pits costumed teams from the university departments against each other in inflatable boats in a challenge to win the "Gyldne Bækken" (Golden Chamber Pot) trophy. The annual lighting of the Christmas lights on the <a href="Salling%20%28department%20store%29">Salling</a> department store in <a href="S%C3%B8ndergade%2C%20Aarhus">Søndergade</a> has also become an attraction in recent times, packing the pedestrianized city center with thousands of revellers.

The relatively mild, temperate marine climate, allows for outdoor recreation year round, including walking, hiking, cycling and outdoor team sports. Mountain biking is usually restricted to marked routes. Watersports like sailing, kayaking, motor boating, etc. are also popular, and since the bay rarely freezes up in winter, they can also be practised most of the year.

Aarhusian, as most local dialects in Denmark, has diminished in use through the 20th century and most people today speak some version of Standard Danish with regional features although it still has a strong presence in older segments of the population and in areas with high numbers of immigrants. Common or traditional Aarhusian words are: træls (tiresome), noller (silly or dumb) and dælme (<a href="Phrasal%20exclamation">Excl</a>. damn me). The dialect is notable for single syllable words ending in "d" being pronounced with <a href="st%C3%B8d">stød</a> while the same letter in multiple syllable words is pronounced as "j", i.e.. <a href="Odder">Odder</a> is pronounced "Ojjer". Like other dialects in East Jutland it has two <a href="grammatical%20gender">grammatical gender</a>s, similar to Standard Danish, but different from West Jutlandic dialects which have only one. In 2009 the University of Aarhus compiled a list of contemporary public figures, who best exemplify the dialect, including <a href="Jacob%20Haugaard">Jacob Haugaard</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Helmig">Thomas Helmig</a>, <a href="Steffen%20Brandt">Steffen Brandt</a>, <a href="Stig%20T%C3%B8fting">Stig Tøfting</a>, <a href="Flemming%20J%C3%B8rgensen">Flemming Jørgensen</a>, <a href="Tina%20Dickow">Tina Dickow</a> and <a href="Camilla%20Martin">Camilla Martin</a>. In popular culture the dialect features prominently in <a href="Niels%20Malmros">Niels Malmros</a>' movie "Aarhus By Night" and 90s comedy sketches by Jacob Haugaard and <a href="Finn%20N%C3%B8rbygaard">Finn Nørbygaard</a>.

The five sailing clubs routinely win national and international titles in a range of disciplines and the future national watersports stadium will be located on the <a href="Aarhus%20Docklands">Aarhus Docklands</a> in the city centre. The Bakken Bears have most recently won the Danish basketball championships in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.

The municipality actively supports sports organisations in and around the city, providing public organisations that aim to attract major sporting events and strengthen professional sports. The <a href="National%20Olympic%20Committee%20and%20Sports%20Confederation%20of%20Denmark">National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark</a> counts some 380 sports organisations within the municipality and about one third of the population are members of one. Soccer is by far the most popular sport followed by <a href="Gymnastics">Gymnastics</a>, <a href="Handball">Handball</a> and <a href="Badminton">Badminton</a>.

In recent decades, many free and public sports facilities have sprung up across the city, such as <a href="street%20football">street football</a>, basketball, <a href="climbing%20wall">climbing wall</a>s, <a href="skateboarding">skateboarding</a> and <a href="beach%20volley">beach volley</a>. Several natural sites also offer <a href="green%20exercise">green exercise</a>, with exercise equipment installed along the paths and tracks reserved for <a href="mountain%20biking">mountain biking</a>. The newly reconstructed area of <a href="Skjoldh%C3%B8jkilen">Skjoldhøjkilen</a> is a prime example.

Aarhus has hosted many sporting events including the <a href="2010%20European%20Women%27s%20Handball%20Championship">2010 European Women's Handball Championship</a>, the <a href="2014%20European%20Men%27s%20Handball%20Championship">2014 European Men's Handball Championship</a>, the <a href="Men%27s%20European%20Volleyball%20Championship">2013 Men's European Volleyball Championships</a>, the 2005 <a href="European%20Table%20Tennis%20Championships">European Table Tennis Championships</a>, the <a href="Denmark%20Open">Denmark Open</a> in <a href="badminton">badminton</a>, the <a href="Union%20Cycliste%20Internationale">UCI</a> <a href="UCI%20Women%27s%20Road%20World%20Cup">Women's Road Cycling World Cup</a>, the 2006 <a href="World%20Orienteering%20Championships">World Orienteering Championships</a>, the <a href="2006%20World%20Artistic%20Gymnastics%20Championships">2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships</a> and the <a href="GF%20World%20Cup">GF World Cup</a> (women's handball). Aarhus is on average host to one or two international sailing competitions every year and hosted the <a href="ISAF%20Youth%20Sailing%20World%20Championships">ISAF Youth Sailing World Championships</a> in 2008 and will in 2018 host the <a href="ISAF%20Sailing%20World%20Championships">ISAF Sailing World Championships</a>, the world championship for the 12 Olympic sailing disciplines and an important qualifier for the 2020 Olympics.

Aarhus is the principal centre for education in the Jutland region. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. Aarhus has the greatest concentration of students in Denmark, fully 12% of those living there attending short, medium or long courses of study. In addition to around 25 institutions of higher education, several research forums have evolved to assist in the transfer of expertise from education to business. The city is home to more than 55,000 students.

On 1 January 2012, <a href="Aarhus%20University">Aarhus University</a> (AU) was the largest university in Denmark by number of students enrolled. It is <a href="University%20ranking">ranked</a> among the top 100 universities in the world by several of the most influential and respected rankings. The university has approximately 41,500 <a href="Bachelor%27s%20degree">Bachelor</a> and <a href="Master%27s%20degree">Master</a> students enrolled as well as about 1,500 <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> students. It is possible to engage in higher academic studies in many areas, from the traditional spheres of <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a>, <a href="humanities">humanities</a> and <a href="theology">theology</a> to more vocational academic areas like <a href="engineering">engineering</a> and <a href="dentistry">dentistry</a>.

<a href="Aarhus%20Tech">Aarhus Tech</a> is one of the largest technical colleges in Denmark, teaching undergraduate study programmes in English, including <a href="vocational%20education%20and%20training">vocational education and training</a> (VET), continuing vocational training (CVT), and <a href="human%20resource%20development">human resource development</a>. <a href="Business%20Academy%20Aarhus">Business Academy Aarhus</a> is among the largest business academies in Denmark and offers undergraduate and some academic degrees, in <a href="IT">IT</a>, business and technical fields.

The <a href="Danish%20School%20of%20Media%20and%20Journalism">Danish School of Media and Journalism</a> (DMJX) is the oldest and largest of the colleges, offering journalism courses since 1946. In 2014 it had approximately 1,700 students. In 1974 it became an independent institution conducting research and teaching at undergraduate level. In 2004, the school collaborated with Aarhus University to establish the Centre for University studies in Journalism, offering master's courses in journalism, and granting degrees through the university.

The <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music%2C%20Aarhus/Aalborg">Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus</a> ("Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium") is a <a href="conservatoire">conservatoire</a>, established under the auspices of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Culture%20%28Denmark%29">Danish Ministry of Culture</a> in 1927. In 2010, it merged with the Royal Academy of Music in Aalborg, which was founded in 1930. Under the patronage of His Royal Highness <a href="Frederik%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Denmark">Crown Prince Frederik</a>, it offers graduate level studies in areas such as music teaching, and solo and professional musicianship. <a href="VIA%20University%20College">VIA University College</a> was established in January 2008 and is one of eight new regional organisations offering <a href="bachelor">bachelor</a> courses of all kinds, throughout the <a href="Central%20Denmark%20Region">Central Denmark Region</a>. It offers over 50 higher educations, taught in Danish or sometimes in English, with vocational education and it participates in various research and development projects. <a href="Aarhus%20School%20of%20Architecture">Aarhus School of Architecture</a> ("Arkitektskolen Aarhus") was founded in 1965. Along with the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts</a> of Copenhagen, it is responsible for the education of architects in Denmark. With an enrolment of approximately 900 students, it teaches in five main departments: architecture and aesthetics, urban and landscape, architectonic heritage, design and architectural design. Also of note is <a href="KaosPilots">KaosPilots</a> and several other higher education centres.

The main railway station in Aarhus is <a href="Aarhus%20Central%20Station">Aarhus Central Station</a> located in the city centre. <a href="DSB%20%28railway%20company%29">DSB</a> has connections to destinations throughout Denmark and beyond. Two local railways provide commuter services to <a href="Grenaa">Grenaa</a> and <a href="Odder">Odder</a>. The <a href="Aarhus%20Letbane">Aarhus Letbane</a> is a planned <a href="tram-train">tram-train</a> project that will link two railway lines with a new light rail route through the city. Most city bus lines go through the inner city and pass through either <a href="Park%20All%C3%A9%2C%20Aarhus">Park Allé</a> or <a href="Baneg%C3%A5rdsplads%2C%20Aarhus">Banegårdspladsen</a> (lit.: The Central Station Square) or both. Regional and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal, located north-west of Banegårdspladsen, in front of the <a href="Radisson%20SAS">Radisson SAS</a> Scandinavia hotel at Margrethepladsen. The long-distance buses of "linie888" connect Aarhus to other cities in Jutland and <a href="Zealand">Zealand</a>.
Ferries administered by Danish ferry company <a href="Mols-Linien">Mols-Linien</a> transports passengers and motorvehicles between Aarhus and <a href="Sj%C3%A6llands%20Odde">Sjællands Odde</a> on <a href="Zealand">Zealand</a>. The ferries comprises "<a href="HSC%20KatExpress%201">HSC KatExpress 1</a>" and "<a href="HSC%20KatExpress%202">HSC KatExpress 2</a>", the world's largest diesel-powered <a href="catamaran">catamaran</a>s, and "<a href="HSC%20Max%20Mols">HSC Max Mols</a>". <a href="Aarhus%20Airport">Aarhus Airport</a>, is located on Djursland, north-east of Aarhus near <a href="Tirstrup">Tirstrup</a> and provides transport to both Copenhagen and international destinations. The larger <a href="Billund%20Airport">Billund Airport</a> is situated south-west of Aarhus.

Regarding air transport, Aarhus is served by the <a href="Aarhus%20Airport">Aarhus Airport</a> in Tirstrup about 35 km northeast of the city centre. There has been much discussion about constructing a new airport closer to the city for many years, but so far, no plans have been realised. In August 2014, the city council officially initiated a process to assert the viability of a new international airport. A small <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> now operates four flights daily between Aarhus harbour and Copenhagen harbour.

Aarhus has a free bike sharing system, <a href="Aarhus%20Bycykler">Aarhus Bycykler</a> (Aarhus City Bikes). The bicycles are available from 1 April to 30 October at 57 stands throughout the city and can be obtained by placing a DKK 20 coin in the release slot, like caddies in a supermarket. The coin can be retrieved when the bike is returned. Bicycles can also be hired from many shops.

Aarhus is home to <a href="Aarhus%20University%20Hospital">Aarhus University Hospital</a>, one of six Danish "Super Hospitals" officially established in 2007 when <a href="Regions%20of%20Denmark">the regions</a> reformed the Danish healthcare sector. The university hospital is the result of a series of mergers in the 2000s between the former hospitals <a href="Skejby%20Sygehus">Skejby Sygehus</a>, the <a href="Aarhus%20Municipal%20Hospital">Municipal Hospital</a>, the <a href="Aarhus%20County%20Hospital">County Hospital</a>, <a href="Marselisborg%20Hospital">Marselisborg Hospital</a> and <a href="Jydske%20Asyl">Risskov Psychiatric Hospital</a>. It is today the largest hospital in Denmark with a combined staff of some 10,000 and 1,150 patient beds, across five locations. In 2012 construction of "Det Nye Universitetshospital" (The New University Hospital) began which ending in 2019 will centralize all departments by expanding the former Skejby Sygehus to with an additional for a new psychiatric center. The hospital is divided in four clinical centers, a service center and one administrative unit along with twelve research centers. It was ranked the best hospital in Denmark in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.

Private hospitals specialized in different areas from plastic surgery to fertility treatments operate in Aarhus as well. "Ciconia Aarhus Private Hospital" founded in 1984 is a leading Danish fertility clinic and the first of its kind in Denmark. Ciconia has provided for the birth of 6,000 children by artificial insemination and continually conducts research into the field of fertility. "Aagaard Clinic", established in 2004, is another private fertility and <a href="gynecology">gynecology</a> clinic which since 2004 has undertaken fertility treatments that has resulted in 1550 births. <a href="Aarhus%20Municipality">Aarhus Municipality</a> also offers a number of specialized services in the areas of nutrition, exercise, sex, smoking and drinking, activities for the elderly, health courses and lifestyle.

The first daily newspaper to appear in Aarhus was "<a href="%C3%85rhus%20Stiftstidende">Århus Stiftstidende</a>", established in 1794 as "Aarhuus Stifts Adresse-Contoirs Tidender", with a moderately conservative approach. Once one of Denmark's largest, it was a leading provincial newspaper for a time, but after the Second World War it increasingly faced competition from "<a href="Demokraten%20%281873%29">Demokraten</a>" (1884–1974) and "Jyllands-Posten", both published in Aarhus. In 1998, it merged with "Randers Amtsavis" and is now run by Midtjyske Medier, part of <a href="Berlingske%20Media">Berlingske Media</a>. The daily newspaper of "Jyllandsposten" (today known as "<a href="Jyllands-Posten">Jyllands-Posten</a>") was established in 1871 in Aarhus, and takes a generally right-wing editorial approach. With a reputation as a serious news publication, the paper has always included news from <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> in particular, but somewhat less so since its promotion as a national newspaper ("Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten") in the 1960s. Today it is one of the three leading serious newspapers in Denmark, the others being "<a href="Berlingske">Berlingske</a>" and "<a href="Politiken">Politiken</a>". Jyllands-Posten publishes "JP Aarhus", a section dedicated to news in and around Aarhus, and the free cityguide website of "Aarhusportalen" (The Aarhus Portal). The Copenhagen-based media company of "Politiken", also publishes several free local papers once a week in parts of Denmark and Sweden. In Aarhus, they publish a total of five local newspapers; "Aarhus Midt", "Aarhus Nord", "Aarhus Vest", "Aarhus Syd" and "Aarhus Weekend".

<a href="Danmarks%20Radio">Danmarks Radio</a> has a large department in Aarhus with over 200 employees. It runs the DR Østjylland radio programme, provides local contributions to <a href="DR%20P4">DR P4</a>, and produces local regional television programmes. In 1990, <a href="TV%202%20%28Denmark%29">TV 2</a> established its Jutland headquarters in <a href="Randers">Randers</a> but moved to <a href="Skejby">Skejby</a> in northern Aarhus in 1999. The station broadcasts regional news and current affairs television and radio programmes. Since 2012, it has run its own TV channel, <a href="TV%202/%C3%98stjylland">TV 2 Østjylland</a>. Aarhus has its own local TV channel TVAarhus, transmitting since 1984. After an agreement on 1 July 2014, TVAarhus can be watched by 130,000 households in Aarhus, making it the largest cable-transmitted local TV channel in Denmark.

With over 1,700 students, the <a href="Danish%20School%20of%20Media%20and%20Journalism">Danish School of Media and Journalism</a> ("Danmarks Medie- og Journalisthøjskole") is the country's largest and oldest school of journalism. The school works closely with Aarhus University where the first journalism course was established in 1946. In 2004, the two institutions established the Centre for University Studies in Journalism, which offers master's courses.

Aarhus is home to 32 <a href="consulate">consulate</a>s and the city is <a href="Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities">twinned</a> with seven cities, all co-operating in the spheres of public schools, culture, welfare and commercial interests.

<doc id="1051" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1051" title="Alexis Carrel">
Alexis Carrel

Alexis Carrel (; 28 June 1873 – 5 November 1944) was a <a href="French%20people">French</a> surgeon and biologist who was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> in 1912 for pioneering vascular <a href="suturing">suturing</a> techniques. He invented the first <a href="perfusion%20pump">perfusion pump</a> with <a href="Charles%20A.%20Lindbergh">Charles A. Lindbergh</a> opening the way to <a href="organ%20transplantation">organ transplantation</a>. Like many intellectuals of his time, he promoted <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>. 
He was a regent for the French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems during <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy France</a> which implemented the eugenics policies there; his association with the Foundation and with <a href="Jacques%20Doriot">Jacques Doriot</a>'s ultra-nationalist <a href="Parti%20Populaire%20Fran%C3%A7ais">Parti Populaire Français</a> led to investigations of collaborating with the Nazis, but he died before any trial could be held. He faced media attacks towards the end of his life over his alleged involvement with the Nazis.

A <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> laureate in 1912, Alexis Carrel was also elected twice, in 1924 and 1927, as an honorary member of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20the%20USSR">Academy of Sciences of the USSR</a>.

Born in <a href="Sainte-Foy-l%C3%A8s-Lyon">Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon</a>, <a href="Rh%C3%B4ne%20%28department%29">Rhône</a>, Carrel was raised in a devout Catholic family and was educated by <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>, though he had become an agnostic by the time he became a university student. He was a pioneer in <a href="transplantology">transplantology</a> and <a href="thoracic%20surgery">thoracic surgery</a>. Alexis Carrel was also a member of <a href="learned%20societies">learned societies</a> in the U.S., Spain, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Vatican City, Germany, Italy and Greece and received honorary doctorates from <a href="Queen%27s%20University%20Belfast">Queen's University of Belfast</a>, <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, California, New York, <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> and <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>.

In 1902, he was claimed to have witnessed the miraculous cure of Marie Bailly at <a href="Lourdes">Lourdes</a>, made famous in part because she named Carrel as a witness of her cure. After the notoriety surrounding the event, Carrel could not obtain a hospital appointment because of the pervasive anticlericalism in the French university system at the time. In 1903 he emigrated to Montreal, Canada, but soon relocated to Chicago, Illinois to work for Hull Laboratory. While there he collaborated with American physician <a href="Charles%20Claude%20Guthrie">Charles Claude Guthrie</a> in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs as well as the <a href="head%20transplant">head</a>, and Carrel was awarded the 1912 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for these efforts.

In 1906 he joined the newly formed <a href="Rockefeller%20Institute%20of%20Medical%20Research">Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research</a> in New York where he spent the rest of his career. There he did significant work on tissue cultures with pathologist <a href="Montrose%20Thomas%20Burrows">Montrose Thomas Burrows</a>. In the 1930s, Carrel and <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> became close friends not only because of the years they worked together but also because they shared personal, political, and social views. Lindbergh initially sought out Carrel to see if his sister-in-law's heart, damaged by <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a>, could be repaired. When Lindbergh saw the crudeness of Carrel's machinery, he offered to build new equipment for the scientist. Eventually they built the first perfusion pump, an invention instrumental to the development of organ transplantation and open heart surgery. Lindbergh considered Carrel his closest friend, and said he would preserve and promote Carrel's ideals after his death.

Due to his close proximity with <a href="Jacques%20Doriot">Jacques Doriot</a>'s fascist <a href="Parti%20Populaire%20Fran%C3%A7ais">Parti Populaire Français</a> (PPF) during the 1930s and his role in implementing eugenics policies during Vichy France, he was accused after the Liberation of collaboration, but died before the trial.

In his later life he returned to his Catholic roots. In 1939 he met with <a href="Trappist%20monk">Trappist monk</a> Alexis Presse on a recommendation. Although Carrel was skeptical about meeting with a priest, Presse ended up having a profound influence on the rest of Carrel's life. In 1942, he said "I believe in the existence of God, in the immortality of the soul, in Revelation and in all the Catholic Church teaches." He summoned Presse to administer the Catholic <a href="Sacrament">Sacrament</a>s on his death bed in November 1944.

For much of his life, Carrel and his wife spent their summers on the Ile Saint-Gildas, which they owned. After he and Lindbergh became close friends, Carrel persuaded him to also buy a neighboring island, the <a href="Ile%20Illiec">Ile Illiec</a>, where the Lindberghs often resided in the late 1930s.

Carrel was a young surgeon in 1894, when the French president <a href="Marie%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Sadi%20Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> was assassinated with a knife. Carnot bled to death due to severing of his portal vein, and surgeons who treated the president felt that the could not be successfully reconnected. This left a deep impression on Carrel, and he set about developing new techniques for suturing blood vessels. The technique of "triangulation", using three stay-sutures as traction points in order to minimize damage to the vascular wall during suturing, was inspired by sewing lessons he took from an embroideress and is still used today. Julius Comroe wrote: "Between 1901 and 1910, Alexis Carrel, using experimental animals, performed every feat and developed every technique known to vascular surgery today." He had great success in reconnecting arteries and veins, and performing surgical grafts, and this led to his Nobel Prize in 1912.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–1918), Carrel and the English chemist <a href="Henry%20Drysdale%20Dakin">Henry Drysdale Dakin</a> developed the Carrel–Dakin method of treating wounds based on chlorine (Dakin's solution) which, preceding the development of <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a>, was a major medical advance in the care of traumatic wounds. For this, Carrel was awarded the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>.

Carrel co-authored a book with famed pilot <a href="Charles%20A.%20Lindbergh">Charles A. Lindbergh</a>, "The Culture of Organs", and worked with Lindbergh in the mid-1930s to create the "perfusion pump," which allowed living organs to exist outside the body during surgery. The advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of <a href="open-heart%20surgery">open-heart surgery</a> and <a href="organ%20transplants">organ transplants</a>, and to have laid the groundwork for the <a href="artificial%20heart">artificial heart</a>, which became a reality decades later. Some critics of Lindbergh claimed that Carrel overstated Lindbergh's role to gain media attention, but other sources say Lindbergh played an important role in developing the device. Both Lindbergh and Carrel appeared on the cover of <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a> on June 13, 1938.

Carrel was also interested in the phenomenon of <a href="senescence">senescence</a>, or aging. He claimed that all cells continued to grow indefinitely, and this became a dominant view in the early 20th century. Carrel started an experiment on January 17, 1912, where he placed tissue cultured from an <a href="embryo">embryo</a>nic chicken heart in a stoppered <a href="Pyrex">Pyrex</a> flask of his own design. He maintained the living culture for over 20 years with regular supplies of nutrient. This was longer than a chicken's normal lifespan. The experiment, which was conducted at the <a href="Rockefeller%20University">Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</a>, attracted considerable popular and scientific attention.

Carrel's experiment by some was never successfully replicated, and in the 1960s <a href="Leonard%20Hayflick">Leonard Hayflick</a> and <a href="Paul%20Moorhead">Paul Moorhead</a> proposed that <a href="Cellular%20differentiation">differentiated cells</a> can undergo only a limited number of divisions before dying. This is known as the <a href="Hayflick%20limit">Hayflick limit</a>, and is now a pillar of biology.

L. Hayflick has shown that a cell has a limited number of divisions, equal to the so called "Hayflick’s Limit." However, L. Franks and others (Loo et al. 1987; Nooden and Tompson 1995; Frolkis 1988a), have shown that the number of cell divisions can be considerably greater than that stipulated by the "Hayflick Limit", having practically no limit at all.

It is not certain how Carrel obtained his anomalous results. <a href="Leonard%20Hayflick">Leonard Hayflick</a> suggests that the daily feeding of nutrient was continually introducing new living cells to the alleged immortal culture. J. A. Witkowski has argued that, while "immortal" strains of visibly mutated cells have been obtained by other experimenters, a more likely explanation is deliberate introduction of new cells into the culture, possibly without Carrel's knowledge.

In 1972, the Swedish Post Office honored Carrel with a stamp that was part of its Nobel stamp series. In 1979, the <a href="lunar%20crater">lunar crater</a> <a href="Carrel%20%28crater%29">Carrel</a> was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs.

In February 2002, as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's birth, the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston established the Lindbergh-Carrel Prize, given to major contributors to "development of perfusion and bioreactor technologies for organ preservation and growth". <a href="Michael%20DeBakey">Michael DeBakey</a> and nine other scientists received the prize, a bronze statuette <a href="http%3A//www.fondazionecarrel.org/carrel/1.htm"></a> created for the event by the Italian artist C. Zoli and named "Elisabeth" after Elisabeth Morrow, sister of Lindbergh's wife Anne Morrow, who died from heart disease. It was in fact Lindbergh's disappointment that contemporary medical technology could not provide an artificial heart pump which would allow for heart surgery on her that led to Lindbergh's first contact with Carrel.

In 1902 Alexis Carrel went from being a skeptic of the visions and miracles reported at <a href="Lourdes">Lourdes</a> to being a believer in spiritual cures after experiencing a healing of Marie Bailly that he could not explain. The Catholic journal "Le nouvelliste" reported that she named him as the prime witness of her cure. Alexis Carrel refused to discount a supernatural explanation and steadfastly reiterated his beliefs, even writing a book describing his experience, though it was not published until four years after his death. This was a detriment to his career and reputation among his fellow doctors, and feeling he had no future in academic medicine in France, he emigrated to Canada with the intention of farming and raising cattle. After a brief period, he accepted an appointment at the University of Chicago and two years later at the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research.

In 1935, Carrel published a book titled "L'Homme, cet inconnu" ("Man, The Unknown"), which became a best-seller. In the book, he attempted to outline a comprehensive account what is known and more importantly unknown of the human body and human life "in light of discoveries in biology, physics, and medicine", to elucidate problems of the modern world, and to provide possible routes to a better life for human beings.

For Carrel, the fundamental problem was that:

[M]en cannot follow modern civilization along its present course, because they are degenerating. They have been fascinated by the beauty of the sciences of inert matter. They have not understood that their body and consciousness are subjected to natural laws, more obscure than, but as inexorable as, the laws of the sidereal world. Neither have they understood that they cannot transgress these laws without being punished. They must, therefore, learn the necessary relations of the cosmic universe, of their fellow men, and of their inner selves, and also those of their tissues and their mind. Indeed, man stands above all things. Should he degenerate, the beauty of civilization, and even the grandeur of the physical universe, would vanish. ... Humanity’s attention must turn from the machines of the world of inanimate matter to the body and the soul of man, to the organic and mental processes which have created the machines and the universe of Newton and Einstein.

Carrell advocated, in part, that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group of intellectuals, and by incorporating eugenics into the social framework. He argued for an aristocracy springing from individuals of potential, writing:

We must single out the children who are endowed with high potentialities, and develop them as completely as possible. And in this manner give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.

Carrel advocated the use of <a href="gas%20chambers">gasses</a> to rid humanity of "defectives", thus endorsing the <a href="scientific%20racism">scientific racism</a> <a href="discourse">discourse</a>. His endorsement of this idea began in the mid-1930s, prior to the <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> implementation of such practices in Germany. In the 1936 German introduction of his book, at the publisher's request, he added the following praise of the Nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages:

For the insane and the criminal, he endorsed the use of gassing for euthanasia: 
"(t)he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane, guilty of criminal acts.".

Otherwise he endorsed voluntary positive eugenics. He wrote:
We have mentioned that natural selection has not played its part for a long while. That many inferior individuals have been conserved through the efforts of hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We should, then, turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them and construct greater men.

He continued:
The progress of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired in the course of their existence. Modern society must, therefore, allow to all a certain stability of life, a home, a garden, some friends. Children must be reared in contact with things which are the expression of the mind of their parents. It is imperative to stop the transformation of the farmer, the artisan, the artist, the professor, and the man of science into manual or intellectual proletarians, possessing nothing but their hands or their brains. The development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of <a href="industrial%20civilization">industrial civilization</a>. It has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit, and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense. It is destroying the remains of culture. All forms of the proletariat must be suppressed. Each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family. Marriage must cease being only a temporary union. The union of man and woman, like that of the higher anthropoids, ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection. The laws relating to education, and especially to that of girls, to marriage, and divorce should, above all, take into account the interest of children. Women should receive a higher education, not in order to become doctors, lawyers, or professors, but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings.

The free practice of eugenics could lead not only to the development of stronger individuals, but also of strains endowed with more endurance, intelligence, and courage. These strains should constitute an aristocracy, from which great men would probably appear. Modern society must promote, by all possible means, the formation of better human stock. No financial or moral rewards should be too great for those who, through the wisdom of their marriage, would engender geniuses. The complexity of our civilization is immense. No one can master all its mechanisms. However, these mechanisms have to be mastered. There is need today of men of larger mental and moral size, capable of accomplishing such a task. The establishment of a hereditary biological aristocracy through voluntary eugenics would be an important step toward the solution of our present problems.

In 1937, Carrel joined <a href="Jean%20Coutrot">Jean Coutrot</a>’s "Centre d’Etudes des Problèmes Humains" - Coutrot’s aim was to develop what he called an "economic humanism" through "collective thinking." In 1941, through connections to the cabinet of <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy France</a> president <a href="Philippe%20P%C3%A9tain">Philippe Pétain</a> (specifically, French industrial physicians <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gros">André Gros</a> and Jacques Ménétrier) he went on to advocate for the creation of the "Fondation Française pour l’Etude des Problèmes Humains" (French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems) which was created by <a href="decree">decree</a> of the Vichy regime in 1941, and where he served as 'regent'.

The foundation was at the origin of the October 11, 1946, law, enacted by the <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20the%20French%20Republic">Provisional Government of the French Republic</a> (GPRF), which institutionalized the field of <a href="occupational%20medicine">occupational medicine</a>. It worked on <a href="demographics">demographics</a> (Robert Gessain, Paul Vincent, Jean Bourgeois-Pichat), on <a href="economics">economics</a>, (<a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Perroux">François Perroux</a>), on <a href="nutrition">nutrition</a> (Jean Sutter), on habitation (Jean Merlet) and on the first <a href="opinion%20poll">opinion poll</a>s (Jean Stoetzel). "The foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of finance and public health. It was given financial autonomy and a budget of forty million francs—roughly one franc per inhabitant—a true luxury considering the burdens imposed by the German Occupation on the nation’s resources. By way of comparison, the whole <a href="Centre%20National%20de%20la%20Recherche%20Scientifique">Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</a> (CNRS) was given a budget of fifty million francs."

The Foundation made many positive accomplishments during its time. Yet it was also behind the origin of the December 16, 1942 Act inventing the "prenuptial certificate", which had to precede any marriage and was supposed, after a biological examination, to insure the "good health" of the spouses, in particular in regard to sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and "life hygiene" (sic). The institute also conceived the "scholar book" ("livret scolaire"), which could be used to record students' grades in the French secondary schools, and thus classify and select them according to scholastic performance.

According to Gwen Terrenoire, writing in "Eugenics in France (1913-1941) : a review of research findings", "The foundation was a pluridisciplinary centre that employed around 300 researchers (mainly statisticians, psychologists, physicians) from the summer of 1942 to the end of the autumn of 1944. After the <a href="liberation%20of%20Paris">liberation of Paris</a>, Carrel was suspended by the Minister of Health; he died in November 1944, but the Foundation itself was "purged", only to reappear in a short time as the <a href="Institut%20national%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9tudes%20d%C3%A9mographiques">Institut national d’études démographiques</a> (INED) that is still active." Although Carrel himself was dead most members of his team did move to the INED, which was led by famous <a href="demographist">demographist</a> <a href="Alfred%20Sauvy">Alfred Sauvy</a>, who coined the expression "<a href="Third%20World">Third World</a>". Others joined <a href="Robert%20Debr%C3%A9">Robert Debré</a>'s "<a href="Institut%20national%20d%27hygi%C3%A8ne">Institut national d'hygiène</a>" (National Hygiene Institute), which later became the <a href="INSERM">INSERM</a>.

Experiments with the Carrel-Dakin method were depicted in the 2014 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a>, "<a href="The%20Crimson%20Field">The Crimson Field</a>".

All Souls' Day

In <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, All Souls' Day commemorates All Souls, the Holy Souls, or the Faithful Departed; that is, the <a href="soul">soul</a>s of Christians who have died. Observing Christians typically remember deceased relatives on the day. In <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western Christianity</a> the annual celebration is now held on 2 November and is associated with the three days of <a href="Allhallowtide">Allhallowtide</a>, including <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Day">All Saints' Day</a> (1 November) and its vigil, <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> (31 October). In the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Faithful%20%28baptized%20Catholic%29">"the faithful"</a> refers specifically to baptized Catholics; "all souls" commemorates the <a href="church%20penitent">church penitent</a> of souls in <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a>, whereas "all saints" commemorates the <a href="church%20triumphant">church triumphant</a> of <a href="saint">saint</a>s in Heaven. In the <a href="liturgy">liturgical</a> books of the western <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> (the <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin Church</a>) it is called the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (), and is celebrated annually on 2 November. In the ordinary form and Divine Worship form of the Roman Rite, it remains on 2 November if this date falls on a Sunday; in the extraordinary form, it is transferred to Monday, 3 November. On this day in particular, Catholics <a href="pray%20for%20the%20dead">pray for the dead</a>. In <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a> it is called Commemoration of All Faithful Departed and is an optional celebration; Anglicans view All Souls' Day as an extension of the observance of All Saints' Day and it serves to "remember those who have died", in connection with the theological doctrines of the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">resurrection of the body</a> and the <a href="Communion%20of%20Saints">Communion of Saints</a>. In the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> and the associated <a href="Eastern%20Catholic%20Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a>, it is celebrated several times during the year and is not associated with the month of November.

Beliefs and practices associated with All Souls' Day vary widely among Christian churches and denominations.

Among <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Rite">Byzantine (Greek)</a> <a href="Eastern%20Catholic">Catholics</a>, there are several All Souls' Days during the year. Most of these fall on Saturday, since <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> lay in the <a href="Holy%20Sepulchre">Tomb</a> on <a href="Holy%20Saturday">Holy Saturday</a>. They occur on the following occasions:

In the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> there is also a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday closest to the Conception of <a href="St.%20John%20the%20Baptist">St. John the Baptist</a>—<a href="September%2023%20%28Eastern%20Orthodox%20liturgics%29">23 September</a>

In Slavic and Greek Churches, all of the Lenten Soul Saturdays are typically observed. In some of the Churches of the Eastern Mediterranean, Meatfare Saturday, Radonitsa and the Saturday before Pentecost are typically observed.

In addition to the Sundays mentioned above, Saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints, and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the <a href="Octoechos%20%28liturgy%29">Octoechos</a>, unless some greater <a href="Great%20Feasts">feast</a> or <a href="saint">saint</a>'s commemoration occurs.

East Syriac churches including the Syro Malabar Church and Chaldean Catholic Church commemorates the feast of departed faithful on the last Friday of Epiphany(which means Friday just before start of Great Lent). The season of Epiphany remembers the revelation of Christ to the world. And on each Fridays of season of Epiphany the church remembers some important figures in the evangelism.

Apart from this In <a href="Syro%20Malabar%20Church">Syro Malabar Church</a> Friday before the parish festival is also celebrated as feast of departed faithful. Here the parish remembers the activities of forefathers who worked for the parish and faithful. They also request the intercession of all departed for the faithful celebration of parish festival.

In east Syriac liturgy the church remembers departed souls including saints on every Fridays throughout the year since the Christ was crucified and died on Friday.

<a href="Prayer%20for%20the%20dead">Prayer for the dead</a> is a documented practice in Judaism and Christianity. The setting aside of a particular day for praying not for certain named individuals but for whole classes of the departed or for the dead in general cannot be traced to the earliest Christian centuries, but was well established by the end of the first millennium. Prayers for the deceased members of Benedictine monasteries were offered in the week after Pentecost and the practice of praying for the dead at a date near Pentecost was also followed in Spain in the 7th century. Other dates chosen were Epiphany and the anniversary of the death of some well-known saint, as shown by evidence from the beginning of the 9th century. By about 980, 1 October was an established date in Germany. The 11th century saw the introduction of a liturgical commemoration in diocesan calendars. 
In Milan the date was 16 October until changed in the second half of the 16th century to 2 November. This date, the day after <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Day">All Saints' Day</a>, was that which Saint <a href="Odilo%20of%20Cluny">Odilo of Cluny</a> chose in the 11th century for all the monasteries dependent on the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Cluny">Abbey of Cluny</a>. From these the 2 November custom spread to other Benedictine monasteries and thence to the Western Church in general.

The official name of the celebration in the <a href="Roman%20Rite">Roman Rite</a> <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> is "The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed". In some countries the celebration is known as the "<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Dead">Day of the Dead</a>".

In the Roman Rite as revised in 1969, if 2 November falls on a Sunday, the Mass is of All Souls, but the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</a> is that of the Sunday. However, public celebration of Lauds and Vespers of the Dead with the people participating is permitted. While celebration of a Sunday, a solemnity or a feast of the Lord replacing a Sunday begins on the previous evening with Vespers and perhaps evening Mass, the general norms do not allow for anticipation on Saturday evening of the liturgy of All Souls' Day falling on a Sunday, and so they suggest that the formula of the Mass on that Saturday evening is that of the solemnity of All Saints, which outranks the Sunday of Ordinary Time whose Mass would be celebrated on that evening. However, in 2014, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided that for that year the Saturday evening (Sunday vigil) Mass in that country was to be that of All Souls; in countries such as Italy the situation was less clear.

In countries where All Saints' Day is not a <a href="holy%20day%20of%20obligation">holy day of obligation</a> attendance at an evening Mass of All Saints on Saturday 1 November satisfies the Sunday obligation. In England and Wales, where holy days of obligation that fall on a Saturday are transferred to the following day, if 2 November is a Sunday, the solemnity of All Saints is transferred to that date, and All Souls Day is transferred to 3 November. In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, still observed by some, if All Souls Day falls on a Sunday, it is always transferred to 3 November.

Faithful departed may gain <a href="indulgence">indulgence</a>, either plenary or partial indulgence, if the living perform certain acts and meet the specified requirements.

In the minor propers (Introit, Gradual, Tract, Sequence, Offertory, and Communion) are those used for Renaissance and Classical musical <a href="requiem">requiem</a> settings, including the <a href="Dies%20Irae">Dies Irae</a>. This permits the performance of traditional requiem settings in the context of the Divine Worship Form of the Roman Rite on All Souls Day as well as at funerals, votive celebrations of all faithful departed, and anniversaries of deaths.

In the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, All Souls' Day is known liturgically as the Commemoration of All Faithful Departed, and is an optional observance seen as "an extension of All Saints' Day", the latter of which marks the second day of <a href="Allhallowtide">Allhallowtide</a>. Historically and at present, several Anglican churches are dedicated to All Souls. During the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, the observance of All Souls' Day lapsed, although a new Anglican theological understanding of the day has "led to a widespread acceptance of this commemoration among Anglicans". Patricia Bays, with regard to the Anglican view of All Souls' Day, wrote that:

As such, Anglican parishes "now commemorate all the faithful departed in the context of the All Saints' Day celebration", in keeping with this fresh perspective. Contributing to the revival was the need "to help Anglicans mourn the deaths of millions of soldiers in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>". Members of the <a href="Guild%20of%20All%20Souls">Guild of All Souls</a>, an <a href="Anglican%20devotional%20society">Anglican devotional society</a> founded in 1873, "are encouraged to pray for the dying and the dead, to participate in a requiem of All Souls' Day and say a Litany of the Faithful Departed at least once a month".

At the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a> the celebration of All Souls' Day was fused with <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Day">All Saints' Day</a> in the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> or, in the judgement of some, it was "deservedly abrogated". It was reinstated in certain parishes in connection with the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a> of the 19th century and was officially restored in United States Anglicanism with the 1979 Book of Common Prayer and in the Church of England with the 1980 "<a href="Alternative%20Service%20Book">Alternative Service Book</a>". It features in "<a href="Common%20Worship">Common Worship</a>" as a <a href="Lesser%20Festival">Lesser Festival</a> called "Commemoration of the Faithful Departed (All Souls' Day)".

Among continental <a href="Protestantism">Protestants</a> its tradition has been more tenaciously maintained. During <a href="Martin%20Luther%20%28religious%20leader%29">Luther's</a> lifetime, All Souls' Day was widely observed in <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a> although the Roman Catholic meaning of the day was discarded; ecclesiastically in the <a href="Lutheran%20Church">Lutheran Church</a>, the day was merged with, and is often seen as an extension of All Saints' Day, with many Lutherans still visiting and decorating graves on all the days of Allhallowtide, including All Souls' Day. Just as it is the custom of <a href="French%20people">French people</a>, of all ranks and creeds, to decorate the graves of their dead on the "jour des morts", so <a href="German%20people">German</a>, <a href="Poles">Polish</a> and <a href="Hungarians">Hungarian</a> people stream to the graveyards once a year with offerings of flowers and special grave lights (see the picture). Among <a href="Czech%20people">Czech people</a> the custom of visiting and tidying graves of relatives on the day is quite common. In 1816, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> introduced a new date for the remembrance of the Dead among its Lutheran citizens: <a href="Totensonntag">Totensonntag</a>, the last Sunday before <a href="Advent">Advent</a>. This custom was later also adopted by the non-Prussian Lutherans in Germany, but it has not spread much beyond the Protestant areas of Germany.

In the <a href="Methodist%20Church">Methodist Church</a>, <a href="Saints%20in%20Methodism">saints</a> refer to all <a href="Christian">Christian</a>s and therefore, on <a href="All%20Saint%27s%20Day">All Saint's Day</a>, the <a href="Church%20Universal">Church Universal</a>, as well as the deceased members of a <a href="local%20congregation">local congregation</a> are honoured and remembered. In Methodist congregations that celebrate the liturgy on All Souls Day, the observance, as with Anglicanism and Lutheranism, is viewed as an extension of All Saints' Day and as such, Methodists "remember our loved ones who had died" in their observance of this feast.

Some believe that the origins of All Souls' Day in <a href="European%20folklore">European folklore</a> and <a href="folk%20belief">folk belief</a> are related to customs of <a href="ancestor%20veneration">ancestor veneration</a> practiced worldwide, through events such as, in India <a href="Pitru%20Paksha">Pitru Paksha</a>, the Chinese <a href="Ghost%20Festival">Ghost Festival</a>, the Japanese <a href="Bon%20Festival">Bon Festival</a>. The Roman custom was that of the <a href="Lemuria%20%28festival%29">Lemuria</a>.

The formal commemoration of the saints and martyrs (<a href="All%20Saints%27%20Day">All Saints' Day</a>) existed in the early Christian church since its <a href="Edict%20of%20Toleration%20by%20Galerius">legalization</a>, and alongside that developed a day for commemoration of all the dead (All Souls' Day). The modern date of All Souls' Day was first popularized in the early eleventh century after <a href="Odilo%20of%20Cluny">Abbot Odilo</a> established it as a day for the monks of Cluny and associated monasteries to pray for the souls in purgatory.

Many of these European traditions reflect the dogma of <a href="purgatory">purgatory</a>. For example, ringing bells for the dead was believed to comfort them in their cleansing there, while the sharing of <a href="soul%20cakes">soul cakes</a> with the poor helped to buy the dead a bit of respite from the suffering of purgatory. In the same way, lighting candles was meant to kindle a light for the dead souls languishing in the darkness. Out of this grew the traditions of "going souling" and the baking of special types of bread or cakes.

In <a href="Tyrol%20%28state%29">Tirol</a>, cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort. In <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, people flock to the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel, bareheaded, at the graves of their loved ones, and to anoint the hollow of the <a href="tomb%20stone">tombstone</a> with <a href="holy%20water">holy water</a> or to pour libations of milk on it. At bedtime, the supper is left on the table for the souls.

In Bolivia, many people believe that the dead eat the food that is left out for them.
In Brazil people attend a Mass or visit the cemetery taking flowers to decorate their relatives' grave, but no food is involved.

In <a href="Malta">Malta</a> many people make pilgrimages to graveyards, not just to visit the graves of their dead relatives, but to experience the special day in all its significance. Visits are not restricted to this day alone. During the month of November, Malta's cemeteries are frequented by families of the departed. Mass is also said throughout the month, with certain Catholic parishes organising special events at cemetery chapels.

In <a href="Linz">Linz</a>, funereal musical pieces known as <a href="aequale">aequale</a>s were played from tower tops on All Soul's Day and the evening before.

André Gide

André Paul Guillaume Gide (; 22 November 1869 – 19 February 1951) was a French author and winner of the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> in 1947 "for his comprehensive and artistically significant writings, in which human problems and conditions have been presented with a fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight". Gide's career ranged from its beginnings in the <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">symbolist</a> movement, to the advent of <a href="Anti-imperialism">anticolonialism</a> between the two World Wars.

Known for his fiction as well as his autobiographical works, Gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation of the two sides of his personality, split apart by a straitlaced traducing of education and a narrow social <a href="moralism">moralism</a>. Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and <a href="puritan">puritan</a>ical constraints, and centres on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as indicated by his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">USSR</a>.

Gide was born in Paris on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> family. His father was a <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Paris University</a> professor of law who died in 1880. His uncle was the political economist <a href="Charles%20Gide">Charles Gide</a>.

Gide was brought up in isolated conditions in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing his first novel, "The Notebooks of André Walter" (French: "Les Cahiers d'André Walter"), in 1891, at the age of twenty-one.

In 1893 and 1894, Gide travelled in Northern Africa, and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys.

He befriended <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> in Paris, and in 1895 Gide and Wilde met in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>. Wilde had the impression that he had introduced Gide to homosexuality, but, in fact, Gide had already discovered this on his own.

In 1895, after his mother's death, he married his cousin Madeleine Rondeaux, but the marriage remained unconsummated. In 1896, he became mayor of <a href="La%20Roque-Baignard">La Roque-Baignard</a>, a <a href="Communes%20of%20France">commune</a> in Normandy.

In 1901, Gide rented the property <a href="Maderia">Maderia</a> in <a href="St.%20Br%C3%A9lade%27s%20Bay">St. Brélade's Bay</a> and lived there while residing in <a href="Jersey">Jersey</a>. This period, 1901–07, is commonly seen as a time of apathy and turmoil for him.

In 1908, Gide helped found the literary magazine "<a href="Nouvelle%20Revue%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Nouvelle Revue Française</a>" ("The New French Review"). In 1916, <a href="Marc%20All%C3%A9gret">Marc Allégret</a>, only 15 years old, became his lover. Marc was the son – one of five children – of Elie Allégret, who years before had been hired by Gide's mother to tutor her son in light of his weak grades in school, after which he and Gide became fast friends; Allégret was best man at Gide's wedding. Gide and Marc fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence – "the best part of myself," he later commented. In 1918, he met <a href="Dorothy%20Bussy">Dorothy Bussy</a>, who was his friend for over thirty years and translated many of his works into English.

In the 1920s, Gide became an inspiration for writers such as <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a> and <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>. In 1923, he published a book on <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoyevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a>; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of "<a href="Corydon%20%28book%29">Corydon</a>" (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.

In 1923, he sired a daughter, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, a woman who was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter <a href="Th%C3%A9o%20van%20Rysselberghe">Théo van Rysselberghe</a>. This caused the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between Allégret and Gide and damaged the relation with van Rysselberghe. This was possibly Gide's only sexual liaison with a woman, and it was brief in the extreme. Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth "La Dame Blanche" ("The White Lady"). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each on the rue Vavin). She worshiped him, but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship. Gide's legal wife, Madeleine, died in 1938. Later he explored their unconsummated marriage in his memoir of Madeleine, "Et Nunc Manet in Te".

In 1924, he published an autobiography, "If it Die..." (French: "<a href="Si%20le%20grain%20ne%20meurt">Si le grain ne meurt</a>").

In the same year, he produced the first French language editions of <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>'s "<a href="Heart%20of%20Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a>" and "<a href="Lord%20Jim">Lord Jim</a>".

After 1925, he began to campaign for more humane conditions for convicted criminals.

From July 1926 to May 1927, he travelled through the <a href="French%20Equatorial%20Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a> colony with his lover <a href="Marc%20All%C3%A9gret">Marc Allégret</a>. Gide went successively to <a href="Middle%20Congo">Middle Congo</a> (now the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a>), <a href="Ubangi-Shari">Ubangi-Shari</a> (now the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>), briefly to <a href="Chad">Chad</a> and then to <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called "<a href="Travels%20in%20the%20Congo">Travels in the Congo</a>" (French: "Voyage au Congo") and "<a href="Return%20from%20Chad">Return from Chad</a>" (French: "Retour du Tchad"). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform. In particular, he strongly criticized the "Large Concessions" regime (French: "régime des Grandes Concessions"), "i.e.," a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area's <a href="natural%20resource">natural resource</a>s, in particular rubber. He related, for instance, how natives were forced to leave their village for several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their exploitation to <a href="slavery">slavery</a>. The book had important influence on <a href="anti-colonialism">anti-colonialism</a> movements in France and helped re-evaluate the <a href="Impact%20of%20Western%20European%20colonialism%20and%20colonisation">impact of colonialism</a>.

During the 1930s, he briefly became a communist, or more precisely, a <a href="Fellow%20traveller">fellow traveler</a> (he never formally joined the Communist Party). As a distinguished writer sympathizing with the cause of communism, he was invited to tour the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> as a guest of the Soviet Union of Writers. The tour disillusioned him and he subsequently became quite critical of Soviet communism. This criticism of communism caused him to lose socialist friends, especially when he made a clean break with it in "Retour de L'U.R.S.S." in 1936. He was also a contributor to "<a href="The%20God%20that%20Failed">The God That Failed</a>".

...and after his visit to the Soviet Union:

In 1930 Gide published a book about the <a href="Blanche%20Monnier">Blanche Monnier</a> case called "La Séquestrée de Poitiers", changing little but the names of the protagonists. Monnier was a young woman who was kept captive by her own mother for more than 25 years.

In 1939, Gide became the first living author to be published in the prestigious "<a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20de%20la%20Pl%C3%A9iade">Bibliothèque de la Pléiade</a>".

He left France for Africa in 1942 and lived in <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> until the end of World War II. In 1947, he received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>. He devoted much of his last years to publishing his Journal. Gide died in Paris on 19 February 1951. The Roman Catholic Church placed his works on the "<a href="Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum">Index of Forbidden Books</a>" in 1952.

Gide’s biographer Alan Sheridan summed up Gide’s life as a writer and an intellectual:

“Gide’s fame rested ultimately, of course, on his literary works. But, unlike many writers, he was no recluse: he had a need of friendship and a genius for sustaining it.” But his “capacity for love was not confined to his friends: it spilled over into a concern for others less fortunate than himself.”

André Gide’s writings spanned many genres – “As a master of prose narrative, occasional dramatist and translator, literary critic, letter writer, essayist, and diarist, André Gide provided twentieth-century French literature with one of its most intriguing examples of the man of letters.”

But as Gide’s biographer Alan Sheridan points out, “It is the fiction that lies at the summit of Gide’s work.” "Here, as in the "oeuvre" as a whole, what strikes one first is the variety. Here, too, we see Gide’s curiosity, his youthfulness, at work: a refusal to mine only one seam, to repeat successful formulas...The fiction spans the early years of Symbolism, to the “comic, more inventive, even fantastic” pieces, to the later “serious, heavily autobiographical, first-person narratives"...In France Gide was considered a great stylist in the classical sense, “with his clear, succinct, spare, deliberately, subtly phrased sentences.”

Gide was also an avid letter writer, and his surviving letters run into the thousands. But it is the "Journal" that Sheridan calls “the pre-eminently Gidean mode of expression.” "His first novel emerged from Gide’s own journal, and many of the first-person narratives read more or less like journals. In "<a href="The%20Counterfeiters%20%28novel%29">Les faux-monnayeurs</a>", Edouard's journal provides an alternative voice to the narrator's.” “In 1946, when Pierre Herbert asked Gide which of his books he would choose if only one were to survive,” Gide replied, 'I think it would be my "Journal."'" Beginning at the age of eighteen or nineteen, Gide kept a journal all of his life and when these were first made available to the public, they ran to thirteen hundred pages.

“Each volume that Gide wrote was intended to challenge itself, what had preceded it, and what could conceivably follow it. This characteristic, according to Daniel Moutote in his "Cahiers de André Gide" essay, is what makes Gide's work ‘essentially modern’: the 'perpetual renewal of the values by which one lives.'" Gide wrote in his "Journal" in 1930: “The only drama that really interests me and that I should always be willing to depict anew, is the debate of the individual with whatever keeps him from being authentic, with whatever is opposed to his integrity, to his integration. Most often the obstacle is within him. And all the rest is merely accidental.”

As a whole, “The works of André Gide reveal his passionate revolt against the restraints and conventions inherited from 19th-century France. He sought to uncover the authentic self beneath its contradictory masks.”

In his journal, Gide distinguishes between adult-attracted “sodomites” and boy-loving “pederasts”, categorizing himself as the latter.
In the company of <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, he had several sexual encounters with young boys abroad. 

Gide’s novel "<a href="Corydon%20%28book%29">Corydon</a>", which he considered his most important work, erects a defense of pederasty.

Algorithms for calculating variance

Algorithms for calculating variance play a major role in <a href="computational%20statistics">computational statistics</a>. A key difficulty in the design of good <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s for this problem is that formulas for the <a href="variance">variance</a> may involve sums of squares, which can lead to <a href="numerical%20instability">numerical instability</a> as well as to <a href="arithmetic%20overflow">arithmetic overflow</a> when dealing with large values.

A formula for calculating the variance of an entire <a href="statistical%20population">population</a> of size "N" is:

Using <a href="Bessel%27s%20correction">Bessel's correction</a> to calculate an <a href="estimator%20bias">unbiased</a> estimate of the population variance from a finite <a href="statistical%20sample">sample</a> of "n" observations, the formula is:

Therefore, a naive algorithm to calculate the estimated variance is given by the following:

This algorithm can easily be adapted to compute the variance of a finite population: simply divide by "N" instead of "n" − 1 on the last line.

Because and can be very similar numbers, <a href="Loss%20of%20significance">cancellation</a> can lead to the <a href="precision%20%28arithmetic%29">precision</a> of the result to be much less than the inherent precision of the <a href="floating-point%20arithmetic">floating-point arithmetic</a> used to perform the computation. Thus this algorithm should not be used in practice. This is particularly bad if the standard deviation is small relative to the mean. However, the algorithm can be improved by adopting the method of the <a href="assumed%20mean">assumed mean</a>.

We can use a property of the variance to avoid the catastrophic cancellation in this formula,
namely the variance is <a href="Invariant%20%28mathematics%29">invariant</a> with respect to changes in a <a href="location%20parameter">location parameter</a>

with formula_4 any constant, which leads to the new formula

the closer formula_4 is to the mean value the more accurate the result will be, but just choosing a value inside the
samples range will guarantee the desired stability. If the values formula_7 are small then there are no problems with the sum of its squares, on the contrary, if they are large it necessarily means that the variance is large as well. In any case the second term in the formula is always smaller than the first one therefore no cancellation may occur.

If we take just the first sample as formula_4 the algorithm can be written in <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python programming language</a> as
this formula facilitates as well the incremental computation, that can be expressed as
An alternative approach, using a different formula for the variance, first computes the sample mean,
and then computes the sum of the squares of the differences from the mean,
where s is the standard deviation. This is given by the following pseudocode:

This algorithm is numerically stable if "n" is small. However, the results of both of these simple algorithms ("Naïve" and "Two-pass") can depend inordinately on the ordering of the data and can give poor results for very large data sets due to repeated roundoff error in the accumulation of the sums. Techniques such as <a href="compensated%20summation">compensated summation</a> can be used to combat this error to a degree.

It is often useful to be able to compute the variance in a single pass, inspecting each value formula_11 only once; for example, when the data are being collected without enough storage to keep all the values, or when costs of memory access dominate those of computation. For such an <a href="online%20algorithm">online algorithm</a>, a <a href="recurrence%20relation">recurrence relation</a> is required between quantities from which the required statistics can be calculated in a numerically stable fashion.

The following formulas can be used to update the <a href="mean">mean</a> and (estimated) variance of the sequence, for an additional element "x". Here, denotes the sample mean of the first "n" samples ("x", ..., "x"), "s" their sample variance, and "σ" their population variance.

These formulas suffer from numerical instability. A better quantity for updating is the sum of squares of differences from the current mean, formula_15, here denoted formula_16:

A numerically stable algorithm for the sample variance is given below. It also computes the mean.
This algorithm was found by Welford, and it has been thoroughly analyzed. It is also common to denote formula_20 and formula_21.

This algorithm is much less prone to loss of precision due to <a href="catastrophic%20cancellation">catastrophic cancellation</a>, but might not be as efficient because of the division operation inside the loop. For a particularly robust two-pass algorithm for computing the variance, one can first compute and subtract an estimate of the mean, and then use this algorithm on the residuals.

The <a href="Algorithms%20for%20calculating%20variance%23Parallel%20algorithm">parallel algorithm</a> below illustrates how to merge multiple sets of statistics calculated online.

The algorithm can be extended to handle unequal sample weights, replacing the simple counter "n" with the sum of weights seen so far. West (1979) suggests this <a href="incremental%20algorithm">incremental algorithm</a>:

Chan et al. note that the above "On-line" algorithm is a special case of an algorithm that works for any partition of the sample formula_22 into sets formula_23, formula_24:
This may be useful when, for example, multiple processing units may be assigned to discrete parts of the input.

Chan's method for estimating the mean is numerically unstable when formula_28 and both are large, because the numerical error in formula_29 is not scaled down in the way that it is in the formula_30 case. In such cases, prefer formula_31.
def parallel_variance(avg_a, count_a, var_a, avg_b, count_b, var_b):
Assume that all floating point operations use the standard <a href="IEEE%20754%23Double-precision%2064%20bit">IEEE 754 double-precision</a> arithmetic. Consider the sample (4, 7, 13, 16) from an infinite population. Based on this sample, the estimated population mean is 10, and the unbiased estimate of population variance is 30. Both "Naïve" algorithm and "Two-pass" algorithm compute these values correctly. Next consider the sample (, , , ), which gives rise to the same estimated variance as the first sample. "Two-pass" algorithm computes this variance estimate correctly, but "Naïve" algorithm returns 29.333333333333332 instead of 30. While this loss of precision may be tolerable and viewed as a minor flaw of "Naïve" algorithm, it is easy to find data that reveal a major flaw in the naive algorithm: Take the sample to be (, , , ). Again the estimated population variance of 30 is computed correctly by "Two-pass"" algorithm, but "Naïve" algorithm now computes it as −170.66666666666666. This is a serious problem with "Naïve" algorithm and is due to <a href="catastrophic%20cancellation">catastrophic cancellation</a> in the subtraction of two similar numbers at the final stage of the algorithm.

Terriberry extends Chan's formulae to calculating the third and fourth <a href="central%20moment">central moment</a>s, needed for example when estimating <a href="skewness">skewness</a> and <a href="kurtosis">kurtosis</a>:

Here the formula_34 are again the sums of powers of differences from the mean formula_35, giving

For the incremental case (i.e., formula_38), this simplifies to:

By preserving the value formula_44, only one division operation is needed and the higher-order statistics can thus be calculated for little incremental cost.

An example of the online algorithm for kurtosis implemented as described is:
Pébaÿ
further extends these results to arbitrary-order <a href="central%20moment">central moment</a>s, for the incremental and the pairwise cases, and subsequently Pébaÿ et al.
for weighted and compound moments. One can also find there similar formulas for <a href="covariance">covariance</a>.

Choi and Sweetman

offer two alternative methods to compute the skewness and kurtosis, each of which can save substantial computer memory requirements and CPU time in certain applications. The first approach is to compute the statistical moments by separating the data into bins and then computing the moments from the geometry of the resulting histogram, which effectively becomes a <a href="one-pass%20algorithm">one-pass algorithm</a> for higher moments. One benefit is that the statistical moment calculations can be carried out to arbitrary accuracy such that the computations can be tuned to the precision of, e.g., the data storage format or the original measurement hardware. A relative histogram of a random variable can be constructed in
the conventional way: the range of potential values is
divided into bins and the number of occurrences within each bin are
counted and plotted such that the area of each rectangle equals
the portion of the sample values within that bin:

where formula_46 and formula_47 represent the frequency and
the relative frequency at bin formula_48 and formula_49 is the total area of the histogram. After this
normalization, the formula_50 raw moments and central moments of formula_51
can be calculated from the relative histogram:

where the superscript formula_54 indicates the moments are
calculated from the histogram. For constant bin width formula_55 these two expressions can be simplified using formula_56:

The second approach from Choi and Sweetman

is an analytical methodology to combine statistical moments from individual segments of a time-history such that the resulting overall moments are those of the complete time-history. This methodology could be used for parallel computation of statistical moments with subsequent combination of those moments, or for combination of statistical moments computed at sequential times.

If formula_59 sets of statistical moments are known:
formula_60 for formula_61, then each formula_62 can
be expressed in terms of the equivalent formula_50 raw moments:

where formula_65 is generally taken to be the duration of the formula_66 time-history, or the number of points if formula_67 is constant.

The benefit of expressing the statistical moments in terms of formula_68 is that the formula_59 sets can be combined by addition, and there is no upper limit on the value of formula_59.

where the subscript formula_72 represents the concatenated time-history or combined formula_68. These combined values of formula_68 can then be inversely transformed into raw moments representing the complete concatenated time-history

Known relationships between the raw moments (formula_76) and the central moments (formula_77)
are then used to compute the central moments of the concatenated time-history. Finally, the statistical moments of the concatenated history are computed from the central moments:

Very similar algorithms can be used to compute the <a href="covariance">covariance</a>. The naive algorithm is:

For the algorithm above, one could use the following Python code:
As for the variance, the covariance of two random variables is also shift-invariant, so given that formula_80 and formula_81 are whatever two constant values it can be written:

and again choosing a value inside the range of values will stabilize the formula against catastrophic cancellation as well as make it more robust against big sums. Taking the first value of each data set, the algorithm can be written as:

The two-pass algorithm first computes the sample means, and then the covariance:

The two-pass algorithm may be written as:
A slightly more accurate compensated version performs the full naive algorithm on the residuals. The final sums formula_86 and formula_87 "should" be zero, but the second pass compensates for any small error.

A slight modification of the online algorithm for computing the variance yields an online algorithm for the covariance:

We can also make a small modification to compute the weighted covariance:

A stable one-pass algorithm exists, similar to the one above, that computes co-moment formula_88:
The apparent asymmetry in that last equation is due to the fact that formula_92, so both update terms are equal to formula_93. Even greater accuracy can be achieved by first computing the means, then using the stable one-pass algorithm on the residuals.

Thus we can compute the covariance as

Likewise, there is a formula for combining the covariances of two sets that can be used to parallelize the computation:

Almonds begin bearing an economic crop in the third year after planting. Trees reach full bearing five to six years after planting. The fruit matures in the autumn, 7–8 months after flowering.

The almond fruit measures long. In botanical terms, it is not a <a href="nut%20%28fruit%29">nut</a> but a <a href="drupe">drupe</a>. The outer covering or <a href="exocarp">exocarp</a>, fleshy in other members of "Prunus" such as the <a href="plum">plum</a> and <a href="cherry">cherry</a>, is instead a thick, leathery, grey-green coat (with a downy exterior), called the hull. Inside the hull is a reticulated, hard, woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) called the <a href="endocarp">endocarp</a>. Inside the shell is the edible seed, commonly called a nut. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally two occur.

The almond is native to the <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> region of the Middle East, eastward as far as the <a href="Yamuna%20River">Yamuna River</a> in <a href="India">India</a>. It was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the Mediterranean into northern Africa and southern Europe, and more recently transported to other parts of the world, notably California, United States.

The wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. The fruit of the wild forms contains the <a href="glycoside">glycoside</a> <a href="amygdalin">amygdalin</a>, "which becomes transformed into deadly prussic acid (<a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a>) after crushing, chewing, or any other injury to the seed."

Selection of the sweet type from the many bitter types in the wild marked the beginning of almond domestication. It is unclear as to which wild ancestor of the almond created the domesticated species. Ladizinsky suggests the taxon "Amygdalus fenzliana" (Fritsch) Lipsky is the most likely wild ancestor of the almond in part because it is native of Armenia and western Azerbaijan where it was apparently domesticated.

While wild almond species are toxic, domesticated almonds are not; <a href="Jared%20Diamond">Jared Diamond</a> argues that a common genetic mutation causes an absence of amygdalin, and this mutant was grown by early farmers, "at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps, and later intentionally in their orchards". Zohary and Hopf believe that almonds were one of the earliest domesticated <a href="fruit%20trees">fruit trees</a> due to "the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed. Thus, in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings, it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of <a href="grafting">grafting</a>". Domesticated almonds appear in the <a href="Early%20Bronze%20Age">Early Bronze Age</a> (3000–2000 BC) such as the archaeological sites of Numeria (Jordan), or possibly a little earlier. Another well-known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>'s tomb in Egypt (c. 1325 BC), probably imported from the Levant. Of the European countries that the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds, Germany is the northernmost, though the domesticated form can be found as far north as Iceland.

The word "almond" comes from Old French "almande" or "alemande", <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> *"amandula", derived through a form "amygdala" from the Greek ἀμυγδαλή ("amygdalē") (cf. <a href="amygdala">amygdala</a>), an almond. The "al-" in English, for the "a-" used in other languages may be due a confusion with the <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> article "al", the word having first dropped the "a-" as in the Italian form "mandorla"; the British pronunciation "ah-mond" and the modern Catalan "ametlla" and modern French "amande" show a form of the word closer to the original. Other related names of almond include "Mandel" or "Knackmandel" (German), "mandorlo" (Italian for the tree), "mandorla" (Italian for the fruit), "amêndoa" (Portuguese), and "almendra" (Spanish).

The adjective "amygdaloid" (literally "like an almond") is used to describe objects which are roughly almond-shaped, particularly a shape which is part way between a <a href="triangle">triangle</a> and an <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>. See, for example, the <a href="neuroanatomy">brain structure</a> <a href="amygdala">amygdala</a>, which uses a direct borrowing of the Greek term "amygdalē".

The <a href="pollination">pollination</a> of California's almonds is the largest annual <a href="Pollination%20management">managed pollination</a> event in the world, with close to one million hives (nearly half of all <a href="beehive%20%28beekeeping%29">beehives</a> in the US) being trucked in February to the almond groves. Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory <a href="beekeeper">beekeeper</a>s from at least 49 states for the event. This business has been heavily affected by <a href="colony%20collapse%20disorder">colony collapse disorder</a>, causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of <a href="insect%20pollination">insect pollination</a>. To partially protect almond growers from the rising cost of insect pollination, researchers at the <a href="Agricultural%20Research%20Service">Agricultural Research Service</a> (ARS) have developed a new line of <a href="self-pollinating">self-pollinating</a> almond trees. Self-pollinating almond trees, such as the '<a href="Tuono">Tuono</a>', have been around for a while, but their harvest is not as desirable as the insect-pollinated California 'Nonpareil' almond tree. The 'Nonpareil' tree produces large, smooth almonds and offers 60–65% edible kernel per nut. The 'Tuono' has thicker, hairier shells and offers only 32% of edible kernel per nut, but having a thick shell has advantages. The 'Tuono's' shell protects the nut from threatening pests such as the <a href="Amyelois%20transitella">navel orangeworm</a>. ARS researchers have managed to crossbreed the pest-resistant 'Tuono' tree with the 'Nonpareil', resulting in <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridized</a> cultivars of almond trees that are self-pollinated and maintain a high nut quality. The new, self-pollinating hybrids possess quality skin color, flavor, and oil content, and reduce almond growers' dependency on insect pollination.

Almond trees can be attacked by an array of damaging organisms, including insects, fungal pathogens, plant viruses, and bacteria.

World production of almonds was 2.9 million <a href="tonnes">tonnes</a> in 2013, with United States as the largest producer of 1.8 million tonnes.

In the United States, production is concentrated in California, with almonds being California's third-leading agricultural product, its top agricultural export in 2008, and 100% of the U.S. commercial supply. The United States is the dominant supplier of almonds. Almonds are mostly exported as shelled almonds (70%), with the remainder being either unshelled or processed. In 2015, <a href="2012%E2%80%9315%20North%20American%20drought">environmental problems</a> in California affected the almond supply, contributing to higher almond prices worldwide. Rising demand for almonds has also contributed to higher prices worldwide and increased production in California.

Australia is the largest almond production region in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>, and second largest producing country. In 2013, Australia produced 9% of the world almond supply (table). Most of the almond orchards are located along the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> corridor in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

Spain has one of the most diverse commercial cultivars of almonds. It is grown in Spain's Catalonia, Valencia, Murcia, Andalusia, and Aragón regions and the Balearic Islands. In Greece, most of the production comes from the region of <a href="Magnesia%20%28regional%20unit%29">Magnesia</a> at the area of <a href="Almyros">Almyros</a>. The most cultivated types of almonds in Greece are 'Ferragnes' and 'Texas' ('Mission'), which are known for their sweet taste and premium quality. Because of its quality, it is used as a luxury nut. In Turkey, most of the production comes from the Aegean, Marmara, and Mediterranean regions.

The seeds of "Prunus dulcis" var. "dulcis" are predominantly sweet but some individual trees produce seeds that are somewhat more bitter. The genetic basis for bitterness involves a single gene, the bitter flavour furthermore being <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">recessive</a>, both aspects making this trait easier to domesticate. The fruits from "Prunus dulcis" var. "amara" are always bitter, as are the kernels from other species of genus "Prunus", such as peach and cherry (although to a lesser extent).

The bitter almond is slightly broader and shorter than the sweet almond and contains about 50% of the fixed oil that occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme <a href="emulsin">emulsin</a> which, in the presence of water, acts on <a href="Solubility">soluble</a> <a href="glucoside">glucoside</a>s, <a href="amygdalin">amygdalin</a>, and <a href="prunasin">prunasin</a>, yielding <a href="glucose">glucose</a>, <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> and the <a href="essential%20oil">essential oil</a> of bitter almonds, which is nearly pure <a href="benzaldehyde">benzaldehyde</a>, the chemical causing the bitter flavor. Bitter almonds may yield from 4–9 mg of <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a> per almond and contain 42 times higher amounts of cyanide than the trace levels found in sweet almonds. The origin of cyanide content in bitter almonds is via the <a href="enzymatic%20hydrolysis">enzymatic hydrolysis</a> of amygdalin.

Extract of bitter almond was once used medicinally but even in small doses, effects are severe or lethal, especially in children; the cyanide must be removed before consumption. The acute oral lethal dose of cyanide for adult humans is reported to be 0.5–3.5 mg/kg of body weight (approximately 50 bitter almonds), whereas for children, consuming 5–10 bitter almonds may be fatal.

All commercially grown almonds sold as food in the United States are "sweet" cultivars. The US <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> reported in 2010 that some fractions of imported sweet almonds were contaminated with bitter almonds. Eating such almonds could result in <a href="vertigo">vertigo</a> and other typical bitter almond (cyanide) poisoning effects.

While the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes. Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, sliced (flaked, slivered), and as flour. Almonds yield almond oil and can also be made into <a href="almond%20butter">almond butter</a> or <a href="almond%20milk">almond milk</a>. These products can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes.

Along with other nuts, almonds can be sprinkled over breakfasts and desserts, particularly "<a href="muesli">muesli</a>" or ice cream-based dishes. Almonds are used in <a href="marzipan">marzipan</a>, <a href="nougat">nougat</a>, many pastries (including "<a href="jesuite">jesuite</a>s"), cookies (including <a href="macaron">French" macarons"</a>, <a href="macaroon">macaroon</a>s), and cakes (including <a href="Financier%20%28pastry%29">financiers</a>), "<a href="noghl">noghl</a>", and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make <a href="almond%20butter">almond butter</a>, a spread similar to <a href="peanut%20butter">peanut butter</a>, popular with <a href="peanut%20allergy">peanut allergy</a> sufferers and for its naturally sweeter taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole ("green almonds") when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.

<a href="Almond%20cookie">Almond cookie</a>s, Chinese <a href="almond%20biscuit">almond biscuit</a>s, and Italian "<a href="ricciarelli">ricciarelli</a>" are made with almonds.


The 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds, and is marketed by name. The kernel is short, round, relatively sweet, and delicate in texture. It has been grown in Spain for a long time and its origin is unknown; the tree is very productive, and the shell of the nut is very hard. 'Marcona' almonds are traditionally served after being lightly fried in oil, and are used by Spanish confectioners to prepare a sweet called "<a href="turr%C3%B3n">turrón</a>".

Certain natural food stores sell "bitter almonds" or "apricot kernels" labeled as such, requiring significant caution by consumers for how to prepare and eat these products.

Almonds can be processed into a <a href="milk%20substitute">milk substitute</a> called <a href="almond%20milk">almond milk</a>; the nut's soft texture, mild flavour, and light colouring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice for <a href="Lactose%20intolerance">lactose intolerant</a> people and <a href="Veganism">vegans</a>. Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds work well for different production techniques, some of which are similar to that of <a href="soymilk">soymilk</a> and some of which use no heat, resulting in "raw milk" (see <a href="raw%20foodism">raw foodism</a>).

<a href="Almond%20flour">Almond flour</a> or ground <a href="almond%20meal">almond meal</a> combined with sugar or honey as <a href="marzipan">marzipan</a> is often used as a <a href="gluten-free">gluten-free</a> alternative to wheat flour in cooking and baking.

Almonds contain polyphenols in their <a href="seed%20coat">skins</a> consisting of <a href="flavonol">flavonol</a>s, <a href="flavan-3-ol">flavan-3-ol</a>s, <a href="hydroxybenzoic%20acid">hydroxybenzoic acid</a>s and <a href="flavanone">flavanone</a>s analogous to those of certain fruits and vegetables. These phenolic compounds and almond skin <a href="prebiotic%20%28nutrition%29">prebiotic</a> <a href="dietary%20fiber">dietary fiber</a> have commercial interest as <a href="food%20additive">food additive</a>s or <a href="dietary%20supplement">dietary supplement</a>s.

Historically, almond syrup was an <a href="emulsion">emulsion</a> of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with <a href="barley%20syrup">barley syrup</a> (<a href="orgeat%20syrup">orgeat syrup</a>) or in a syrup of <a href="orange%20flower%20water">orange flower water</a> and sugar, often flavored with a synthetic aroma of almonds.

Due to the <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption.

The almond is a nutritionally dense food (see chart pictured right) and a 100 gram amount is a rich source (>20% of the <a href="Daily%20value">Daily value</a>, DV) of the <a href="B%20vitamin">B vitamin</a>s <a href="riboflavin">riboflavin</a> and <a href="niacin">niacin</a>, <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a>, and the <a href="essential%20mineral">essential mineral</a>s <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, iron, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>. The same amount is also a good source (10–19% DV) of the B vitamins <a href="thiamine">thiamine</a>, <a href="vitamin%20B6">vitamin B6</a>, and <a href="folate">folate</a>; choline; and the essential mineral <a href="potassium">potassium</a>. They are also rich in <a href="dietary%20fiber">dietary fiber</a>, <a href="monounsaturated%20fat">monounsaturated fat</a>s, and <a href="polyunsaturated%20fat">polyunsaturated fat</a>s, fats which potentially may lower <a href="LDL%20cholesterol">LDL cholesterol</a>. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds also contain <a href="phytosterol">phytosterol</a>s such as <a href="beta-sitosterol">beta-sitosterol</a>, <a href="stigmasterol">stigmasterol</a>, <a href="campesterol">campesterol</a>, <a href="sitostanol">sitostanol</a>, and <a href="campestanol">campestanol</a>, which have been associated with cholesterol-lowering properties.

Preliminary research associates consumption of almonds with elevated blood levels of <a href="high%20density%20lipoprotein">high density lipoprotein</a>s and lower <a href="low%20density%20lipoprotein">low density lipoprotein</a>s.

Almonds may cause <a href="food%20allergy">allergy</a> or <a href="food%20intolerance">intolerance</a>. Cross-reactivity is common with <a href="peach">peach</a> <a href="allergen">allergen</a>s (<a href="lipid%20transfer%20proteins">lipid transfer proteins</a>) and tree <a href="Nut%20%28fruit%29">nut</a> allergens. Symptoms range from local signs and symptoms (e.g., <a href="oral%20allergy%20syndrome">oral allergy syndrome</a>, <a href="contact%20urticaria">contact urticaria</a>) to systemic signs and symptoms including <a href="anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a> (e.g., <a href="urticaria">urticaria</a>, <a href="angioedema">angioedema</a>, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).

During the digestion process in humans, almond flour may be fermented into <a href="short-chain%20fatty%20acid">short-chain fatty acid</a>s, most notably <a href="butyrate">butyrate</a> which is a <a href="substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrate</a> for cells lining the <a href="large%20intestine">large intestine</a>.

Almonds are a rich source of oil, with 50% of kernel dry mass as fat (table). Almond oil contains 32% <a href="monounsaturated">monounsaturated</a> <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic acid</a> (an <a href="omega-9%20fatty%20acid">omega-9 fatty acid</a>), 13% <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic acid</a> (a <a href="polyunsaturated">polyunsaturated</a> <a href="Omega-6%20fatty%20acid">omega-6</a> <a href="essential%20fatty%20acid">essential fatty acid</a>), and 5% <a href="saturated%20fatty%20acid">saturated fatty acid</a> (USDA link in table). <a href="Linolenic%20acid">Linolenic acid</a>, an polyunsaturated <a href="omega-3">omega-3</a> fat, is not present (table). Almond oil is a rich source of <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a> providing 261% of the Daily Value per 100 ml (table).

""Oleum amygdalae"", the fixed oil, is prepared from either sweet or bitter almonds and is a glyceryl oleate, with a slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a> but readily soluble in <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a> or <a href="diethyl%20ether">ether</a>. Sweet almond oil is obtained from the dried <a href="seed">kernel</a> of sweet almonds.

The oil is good for application to the skin as an <a href="emollient">emollient</a>, and has been traditionally used by <a href="massage%20therapist">massage therapist</a>s to lubricate the skin during a massage session.

Almond oil can also be used as a wood conditioner of certain woodwind instruments, such as the oboe and clarinet.

Almonds are susceptible to <a href="aflatoxin">aflatoxin</a>-producing molds. Aflatoxins are potent <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>ic chemicals produced by molds such as "<a href="Aspergillus%20flavus">Aspergillus flavus</a>" and "<a href="Aspergillus%20parasiticus">Aspergillus parasiticus</a>". The mold contamination may occur from soil, previously infested almonds, and almond pests such as navel-orange worm. High levels of mold growth typically appear as gray to black filament like growth. It is unsafe to eat mold infected tree nuts.

Some countries have strict limits on allowable levels of aflatoxin contamination of almonds and require adequate testing before the nuts can be marketed to their citizens. The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, for example, introduced a requirement since 2007 that all almond shipments to EU be tested for aflatoxin. If aflatoxin does not meet the strict safety regulations, the entire consignment may be reprocessed to eliminate the aflatoxin or it must be destroyed.

The <a href="USDA">USDA</a> approved a proposal by the Almond Board of California to pasteurize almonds sold to the public, after tracing cases of <a href="salmonellosis">salmonellosis</a> to almonds. The almond pasteurization program became mandatory for California companies in 2007. Raw, untreated California almonds have not been available in the U.S. since then.

California almonds labeled "raw" must be steam-pasteurized or chemically treated with <a href="propylene%20oxide">propylene oxide</a> (PPO). This does not apply to imported almonds or almonds sold from the grower directly to the consumer in small quantities. The treatment also is not required for raw almonds sold for export outside of North America.

The Almond Board of California states: “PPO residue dissipates after treatment.” The <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">U.S. EPA</a> has reported: “Propylene oxide has been detected in fumigated food products; consumption of contaminated food is another possible route of exposure.” PPO is classified by the EPA as a “Group B2, probable human <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>."

The USDA-approved marketing order was challenged in court by organic farmers organized by the Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based farm policy research group. According to the <a href="Cornucopia%20Institute">Cornucopia Institute</a>, this almond marketing order has imposed significant financial burdens on small-scale and organic growers and damaged domestic almond markets. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in the spring of 2009 on procedural grounds. In August 2010, a federal appeals court ruled that the farmers have a right to appeal the USDA regulation. In March 2013, the court vacated the suit on the basis that the objections should have been raised in 2007 when the regulation was first proposed.

The almond is highly revered in some cultures. The tree originated in the Middle East, and is mentioned numerous times in the Bible.

In the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, the almond was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering. In the Bible the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a> 43:11, where it is described as "among the best of fruits". In <a href="Book%20of%20Numbers">Numbers</a> 17 <a href="Levi">Levi</a> is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by <a href="Aaron%27s%20rod">Aaron's rod</a>, which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the <a href="Menorah%20%28Temple%29">menorah</a> which stood in the <a href="Holy%20Temple">Holy Temple</a>, "Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers" (<a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> 25:33–34; 37:19–20).

Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the <a href="Virgin%20Birth%20of%20Jesus">Virgin Birth of Jesus</a>; paintings and <a href="icon">icon</a>s often include <a href="mandorla">almond-shaped haloes</a> encircling the <a href="Christ%20Child">Christ Child</a> and as a symbol of <a href="Mary%2C%20the%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary</a>. The word "<a href="Luz">Luz</a>", which appears in <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> 30:37, sometimes translated as "<a href="hazel">hazel</a>", may actually be derived from the Aramaic name for almond (Luz), and is translated as such in some Bible versions such as the <a href="NIV">NIV</a>.
The Arabic name for almond is "laoz". In some parts of the Levant and North Africa it is pronounced "loz", which is very close to its Aramaic origin.

<a href="La%20entrada%20de%20la%20flor">La entrada de la flor</a> is an event celebrated on 1 February in <a href="Torrent%2C%20Valencia">Torrent</a>, Spain, in which the clavarios and members of the Confrerie of the Mother of God deliver a branch of the first-blooming almond-tree to the Virgin.

Since the <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda%20general%20election%2C%201951">1951 general election</a>, the party system has been dominated by the <a href="Antigua%20Labour%20Party">Antigua Labour Party</a> (ALP), for a long time was dominated by the Bird family, particularly Prime Ministers <a href="Vere%20Bird">Vere</a> and <a href="Lester%20Bird">Lester Bird</a>. The opposition claimed to be disadvantaged by the ALP's longstanding monopoly on patronage and its control of the media, especially in the <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda%20general%20election%2C%201999">1999 general election</a>. The <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda%20general%20election%2C%202009">most recent elections</a> to the House of Representatives were held on 12 June 2014. The <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda%20Labour%20Party">Antigua Labour Party</a> government was elected with fourteen seats.

Antisemitism

Antisemitism (also spelled anti-Semitism or anti-semitism) is hostility to, prejudice, or discrimination against <a href="Jews">Jews</a>. A person who holds such positions is called an antisemite. Antisemitism is generally considered to be a form of <a href="racism">racism</a>.

Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of <a href="Persecution%20of%20Jews">persecution</a> include the <a href="Rhineland%20massacres">Rhineland massacres</a> preceding the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a> in 1096, the <a href="Edict%20of%20Expulsion">Edict of Expulsion</a> from England in 1290, the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Spain%23Massacres%20and%20mass%20conversions%20of%201391">massacres of Spanish Jews</a> in 1391, the persecutions of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>, the <a href="Alhambra%20Decree">expulsion from Spain</a> in 1492, the <a href="Khmelnytsky%20Uprising%23Jews">Cossack massacres in Ukraine</a> from 1648 to 1657, various <a href="anti-Jewish%20pogroms%20in%20the%20Russian%20Empire">anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire</a> between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 <a href="Dreyfus%20affair">Dreyfus affair</a> in France, <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German-occupied Europe</a>, official <a href="antisemitism%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet anti-Jewish policies</a>, and Arab and Muslim involvement in the <a href="Jewish%20exodus%20from%20Arab%20and%20Muslim%20countries">Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries</a>.

The root word "" gives the <a href="misnomer">false impression</a> that antisemitism is directed against all <a href="Semitic%20people">Semitic people</a>, "e.g.", including <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>. The compound word "antisemite" was popularized in Germany in 1879 as a scientific-sounding term for "Judenhass" "Jew-hatred", and that has been its common use since then.

The origin of "antisemitic" terminologies is found in the responses of <a href="Moritz%20Steinschneider">Moritz Steinschneider</a> to the views of <a href="Ernest%20Renan">Ernest Renan</a>. As <a href="Alex%20Bein">Alex Bein</a> writes: "The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the "Semites" as a <a href="Race%20%28human%20categorization%29">race</a>]." <a href="Avner%20Falk">Avner Falk</a> similarly writes: 'The German word "antisemitisch" was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase "antisemitische Vorurteile" (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how "<a href="Semitic%20people%23Ethnicity%20and%20race">Semitic races</a>" were inferior to "<a href="Aryan%20race">Aryan race</a>s"'.

<a href="Pseudoscience">Pseudoscientific</a> theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n nationalistic historian <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Treitschke">Heinrich von Treitschke</a> did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by <a href="Nazism">Nazis</a>. According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term "Semitic" almost synonymously with "Jewish", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples, based generally on linguistic criteria.

According to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to "stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism."
In 1879 German journalist <a href="Wilhelm%20Marr">Wilhelm Marr</a> published a pamphlet, "Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet" ("The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective") in which he used the word "Semitismus" interchangeably with the word "Judentum" to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).

This use of "" was followed by a coining of "" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, "Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum" ("The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit", 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word " Antisemitismus", "antisemitism".

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the "Antisemiten-Liga" (League of Antisemites), apparently named to follow the "Anti-Kanzler-Liga" (Anti-Chancellor League). The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their <a href="population%20transfer">forced removal</a> from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published "Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte", and <a href="Wilhelm%20Scherer">Wilhelm Scherer</a> used the term "Antisemiten" in the January issue of "<a href="Neue%20Freie%20Presse">Neue Freie Presse</a>".

The <a href="Jewish%20Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> reports, "In February 1881, a correspondent of the "<a href="Allgemeine%20Zeitung%20des%20Judentums">Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums</a>" speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use ("Allg. Zeit. d. Jud." 1881, p. 138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'"

The related term "<a href="Philo-Semitism">philosemitism</a>" was coined around 1885.

From the outset the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against <a href="Jews">Jews</a>. The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic languages</a> (e.g. <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <a href="Ethiopian%20Semitic%20languages">Ethiopians</a>, and <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrians</a>) who are not the objects of anti-Semitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' has been used to describe <a href="bigotry">bigotry</a> against people who speak other Semitic languages, the validity of such usage has been questioned.

The term may be spelled with or without a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because, "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" whereas "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that." For example, <a href="Emil%20Fackenheim">Emil Fackenheim</a> supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to "[dispel] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes." Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at <a href="Merrimack%20College">Merrimack College</a>; <a href="Yehuda%20Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a>, professor of <a href="Holocaust%20studies">Holocaust studies</a> at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at <a href="Hebrew%20University%20of%20Jerusalem">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>; and <a href="James%20Carroll%20%28author%29">James Carroll</a>, historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on "the existence of something called 'Semitism'", "the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism".

Objections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.

Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to <a href="Olaf%20Blaschke">Olaf Blaschke</a>, has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews", a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Holocaust scholar and <a href="City%20University%20of%20New%20York">City University of New York</a> professor <a href="Helen%20Fein">Helen Fein</a> defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the <a href="University%20of%20Cologne">University of Cologne</a> writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."

For Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious <a href="anti-Judaism">anti-Judaism</a>, antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that <a href="The%20Protocols%20of%20the%20Elders%20of%20Zion">Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world</a>; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.
<a href="Bernard%20Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a> defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a> states that "while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses." For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and <a href="Xenophobia">Xenophobia</a> (now <a href="Fundamental%20Rights%20Agency">Fundamental Rights Agency</a>), then an agency of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, developed a more detailed <a href="EUMC%20Working%20Definition%20of%20Antisemitism">working definition</a>, which states: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It also adds that "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," but that "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; <a href="Holocaust%20denial">denying the Holocaust</a> or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of <a href="dual%20loyalty">dual loyalty</a> or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel. Late in 2013, the definition was removed from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency. A spokesperson said that it had never been regarded as official and that the agency did not intend to develop its own definition. However, despite its disappearance from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency, the definition has gained widespread international use. The definition has been adopted by the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament Working Group on Antisemitism</a>, in 2010 it was adopted by the United States Department of State, in 2014 it was adopted in the Operational Hate Crime Guidance of the UK <a href="College%20of%20Policing">College of Policing</a> and was also adopted by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, and in 2016 it was adopted by the <a href="International%20Holocaust%20Remembrance%20Alliance">International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance</a>, making it the most widely adopted definition of antisemitism around the world.
In 1879, <a href="Wilhelm%20Marr">Wilhelm Marr</a> founded the "Antisemiten-Liga" (Anti-Semitic League). Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, <a href="Karl%20Lueger">Karl Lueger</a>, the popular mayor of <a href="fin%20de%20si%C3%A8cle">fin de siècle</a> <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage. In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, "The New York Times" notes that Lueger was "Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria. In 1895 <a href="A.%20C.%20Cuza">A. C. Cuza</a> organized the "Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle" in Bucharest. In the period before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

In 1882, the early <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> pioneer <a href="Judah%20Leib%20Pinsker">Judah Leib Pinsker</a> wrote that antisemitism was a psychological response rooted in fear and was an inherited predisposition. He named the condition "Judeophobia". 

In the aftermath of the <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister <a href="Josef%20Goebbels">Goebbels</a> announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."

After the 1945 <a href="End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany</a>, and particularly after the full extent of the <a href="The%20Holocaust">Nazi genocide against the Jews</a> became known, the term "anti-Semitism" acquired <a href="pejorative">pejorative</a> connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term. Yehuda Bauer wrote in 1984: "There are no anti-Semites in the world... Nobody says, 'I am anti-Semitic.' You cannot, after Hitler. The word has gone out of fashion."

Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20K%C3%B6nig">René König</a> mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods." König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism." These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. <a href="Bernard%20Lazare">Bernard Lazare</a> identifies three forms of antisemitism: <a href="Christianity%20and%20antisemitism">Christian antisemitism</a>, economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.
<a href="William%20I.%20Brustein">William Brustein</a> names four categories: religious, racial, economic and political. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> historian <a href="Edward%20Flannery">Edward Flannery</a> distinguished four varieties of antisemitism:

Louis Harap separates "economic antisemitism" and merges "political" and "nationalistic" antisemitism into "ideological antisemitism". Harap also adds a category of "social antisemitism".

<a href="Gustavo%20Perednik">Gustavo Perednik</a> has argued that what he terms "Judeophobia" has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger. He also wrote in his book "The Judeophobia" that "The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away."

Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture. Similarly, <a href="Eric%20Kandel">Eric Kandel</a> characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of "Jewishness" as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation." Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning "the Jews' aloofness from the societies in which they live."
An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.

<a href="Religious%20antisemitism">Religious antisemitism</a>, also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by <a href="Religious%20conversion">conversion</a> to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized "<a href="Marranos">Marranos</a>" or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like." William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon <a href="baptism">baptism</a>." From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "... the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism... From the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

The underlying premise of <a href="economic%20antisemitism">economic antisemitism</a> is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.

Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting <a href="Antisemitic%20canard">Antisemitic canard</a>s. Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent <a href="Protocols%20of%20the%20Elders%20of%20Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>, and later repeated by <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> and his <a href="The%20Dearborn%20Independent">Dearborn Independent</a>. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as "<a href="The%20Secret%20Relationship%20Between%20Blacks%20and%20Jews">The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews</a>" published by the <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation of Islam</a>, and on the internet.
<a href="Derek%20Penslar">Derek Penslar</a> writes that there are two components to the financial <a href="Antisemitic%20canard">canards</a>:

<a href="Abraham%20Foxman">Abraham Foxman</a> describes six facets of the financial canards:

<a href="Gerald%20Krefetz">Gerald Krefetz</a> summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world". Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers. During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but after the <a href="Jewish%20Emancipation">Jewish Emancipation</a> and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".

<a href="L%C3%A9on%20Poliakov">Léon Poliakov</a> asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".

An academic study by Francesco D’Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of anti-Semitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded "that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well."

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> as a religion.

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or "Aryans", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, following the <a href="Jewish%20Emancipation">Jewish Emancipation</a>, Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>, the rise of <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on <a href="Race%20%28classification%20of%20human%20beings%29">racial</a> or <a href="ethnicity">ethnic</a> grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism... From the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries. The old laws restricting them to <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>s, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by <a href="racial%20antisemitism">racial antisemitism</a>, encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as <a href="Joseph%20Arthur%20de%20Gobineau">Joseph Arthur de Gobineau</a> and particularly his "Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race" of 1853–5. <a href="Nationalist">Nationalist</a> agendas based on <a href="ethnicity">ethnicity</a>, known as <a href="ethnonationalism">ethnonationalism</a>, usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race. Allied to this were theories of <a href="Social%20Darwinism">Social Darwinism</a>, which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white <a href="Aryan">Aryan</a>s to <a href="Semitic%20people">Semitic</a> Jews.

<a href="William%20I.%20Brustein">William Brustein</a> defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power." Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."

According to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.
<a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust denial</a> and <a href="Jewish%20conspiracy">Jewish conspiracy</a> theories are also considered forms of antisemitism. <a href="Zoological%20conspiracy%20theories">Zoological conspiracy theories</a> have been propagated by the Arab media and Arabic language websites, alleging a "Zionist plot" behind the use of animals to attack civilians or to conduct espionage.

Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of <a href="new%20antisemitism">new antisemitism</a>, coming simultaneously from the <a href="Left-wing%20politics">left</a>, the <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right</a>, and <a href="Islamism">radical Islam</a>, which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the <a href="State%20of%20Israel">State of Israel</a>, and they argue that the language of <a href="anti-Zionism">anti-Zionism</a> and <a href="criticism%20of%20Israel">criticism of Israel</a> are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that <a href="criticism%20of%20Israel">criticisms of Israel</a> and <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a> are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar Gustavo Perednik has posited that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and "proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews". It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the <a href="blood%20libel">blood libel</a>.

Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate <a href="criticism%20of%20Israel">criticism of the State of Israel</a>, and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.

German <a href="indology">indologists</a> arbitrarily identified "layers" in the <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> and <a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a> with the objective of fueling European anti-Semitism via the <a href="Indo-Aryan%20migration%20theory">Indo-Aryan migration theory</a>. This identification required equating <a href="Brahmins">Brahmins</a> with <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, resulting in anti-Brahmanism.

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; <a href="Christian%20antisemitism">Christian antisemitism</a>, which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, a Greek translation of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, was produced. <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>, an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of <a href="Chaeremon%20of%20Alexandria">Chaeremon</a>, <a href="Lysimachus">Lysimachus</a>, <a href="Poseidonius">Poseidonius</a>, <a href="Apollonius%20Molon">Apollonius Molon</a>, and in <a href="Apion">Apion</a> and <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>. <a href="Agatharchides%20of%20Cnidus">Agatharchides of Cnidus</a> ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the "absurdity of <a href="Torah">their Law</a>", making a mocking reference to how <a href="Ptolemy%20Lagus">Ptolemy Lagus</a> was able to invade <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the "<a href="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>". One of the earliest anti-Jewish <a href="edict">edict</a>s, promulgated by <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a> in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the <a href="Maccabees">Maccabees</a> in <a href="Judea">Judea</a>.

In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> retelling of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian prejudices". The ancient Jewish philosopher <a href="Philo%20of%20Alexandria">Philo of Alexandria</a> describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died. The violence in Alexandria may have been caused by the Jews being portrayed as <a href="misanthropy">misanthropes</a>. Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the "<a href="polis">poleis</a>". Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.
Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many <a href="pagan">pagan</a> <a href="ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> writers. Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>, an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian <a href="Leprosy">lepers</a> who had been taught by <a href="Moses">Moses</a> "not to adore the gods." Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings."

There are examples of <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> rulers desecrating the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple</a> and banning Jewish religious practices, such as <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a>, Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in the 3rd century BCE.

The Jewish diaspora on the <a href="Nile%20River">Nile</a> island <a href="Elephantine">Elephantine</a>, which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> were at times antagonistic and resulted in <a href="Jewish-Roman%20wars">several rebellions</a>. According to <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a>, the emperor <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th-century English historian <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE. However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews <a href="History%20of%20antisemitism%23Late%20Roman%20Empire">gradually worsened</a>.

<a href="James%20Carroll%20%28novelist%29">James Carroll</a> asserted: "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. By that ratio, if other factors such as <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s and <a href="forced%20conversion">conversion</a>s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."

In the late 6th century CE, the newly Catholicised Visigothic kingdom in Hispania issued a series of anti-Jewish edicts which forbad Jews from marrying Christians, practicing circumcision, and observing Jewish holy days. Continuing throughout the 7th century, both Visigothic kings and the Church were active in creating social aggression and towards Jews with "civic and ecclesiastic punishments", ranging between forced conversion, slavery, exile and death.

From the 9th century, the <a href="Islamic%20Golden%20Age">medieval Islamic world</a> classified Jews (and Christians) as "<a href="dhimmi">dhimmi</a>", and allowed Jews to practice their religion more freely than they could do in <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval Christian Europe</a>. Under <a href="Al-Andalus">Islamic rule</a>, there was a <a href="Golden%20age%20of%20Jewish%20culture%20in%20Spain">Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain</a> that lasted until at least the 11th century. It ended when several Muslim <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s against Jews took place on the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, including those that occurred in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Córdoba</a> in 1011 and in <a href="1066%20Granada%20massacre">Granada in 1066</a>. Several decrees ordering the destruction of <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>s were also enacted in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> and <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a> from the 11th century. In addition, Jews were forced to convert to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> or face death in some parts of <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> and <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> several times between the 12th and 18th centuries. The <a href="Almohad%20Caliphate">Almohads</a>, who had taken control of the <a href="Almoravid%20dynasty">Almoravids</a>' <a href="Maghreb">Maghribi</a> and Andalusian territories by 1147, were far more fundamentalist in outlook compared to their predecessors, and they treated the "dhimmis" harshly. Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, many Jews and Christians emigrated. Some, such as the family of <a href="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, fled east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while some others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with <a href="blood%20libel">blood libel</a>s, expulsions, <a href="forced%20conversion">forced conversion</a>s and <a href="massacre">massacre</a>s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.

The persecution hit its first peak during the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a>. In the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a> (1096) hundreds or even thousands of <a href="Rhineland%20massacres">Jews were killed as the crusaders arrived.</a> This was the first major outbreak of anti-Jewish violence Christian Europe outside Spain and was cited by Zionists in the 19th century as indicating the need for a state of Israel.

In the <a href="Second%20Crusade">Second Crusade</a> (1147) the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the <a href="Shepherds%27%20Crusade">Shepherds' Crusade</a>s of 1251 and 1320. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all <a href="English%20people">English</a> Jews; in 1394, the expulsion of 100,000 Jews in France; and in 1421, the expulsion of thousands from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland. In medieval and Renaissance Europe, a major contributor to the deepening of antisemitic sentiment and legal action among the Christian populations was the popular preaching of the zealous reform religious orders, the Franciscans (especially Bernardino of Feltre) and Dominicans (especially Vincent Ferrer), who combed Europe and promoted antisemitism through their often fiery, emotional appeals.

As the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, causing the death of a large part of the population, Jews were used as <a href="scapegoating%23Psychology%20and%20sociology">scapegoats</a>. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed. Although <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VI">Pope Clement VI</a> tried to protect them by issuing two <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a>s in 1348, the first on 6 July and an additional one several months later, 900 Jews were <a href="Strasbourg%20massacre">burned alive in Strasbourg</a>, where the plague had not yet affected the city.

During the mid-to-late 17th century the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these conflicts was the <a href="Khmelnytsky%20Uprising">Khmelnytsky Uprising</a>, when <a href="Bohdan%20Khmelnytsky">Bohdan Khmelnytsky</a>'s supporters massacred tens of thousands of <a href="History%20of%20Jews%20in%20Poland">Jews</a> in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and <a href="Slavery%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29">captivity in the Ottoman Empire</a>, called "jasyr".

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. <a href="Peter%20Stuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</a>, the Dutch governor of <a href="New%20Amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a>, implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.

In the <a href="Zaydi">Zaydi imamate</a> of <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>, Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of <a href="Tihamah">Tihamah</a> and which became known as the <a href="Mawza%20Exile">Mawza Exile</a>.

In 1744, <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick II of Prussia</a> limited the number of Jews allowed to live in <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a> to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n cities. In 1750 he issued the "Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft": the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>" (quoting <a href="Simon%20Dubnow">Simon Dubnow</a>). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria">Maria Theresa</a> ordered Jews out of <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This <a href="extortion">extortion</a> was known as "malke-geld" (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph II</a> abolished most of these persecution practices in his "<a href="Toleranzpatent">Toleranzpatent</a>", on the condition that <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a> and <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. <a href="Moses%20Mendelssohn">Moses Mendelssohn</a> wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

In 1772, the empress of Russia <a href="Catherine%20the%20Great">Catherine II</a> forced the Jews of the <a href="Pale%20of%20Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a> to stay in their <a href="shtetls">shtetls</a> and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the <a href="partition%20of%20Poland">partition of Poland</a>.

According to Arnold Ages, <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative". Paul H. Meyer adds: "There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France." Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire's "<a href="Dictionnaire%20Philosophique">Dictionnaire Philosophique</a>" concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.

Historian <a href="Martin%20Gilbert">Martin Gilbert</a> writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> countries. <a href="Benny%20Morris">Benny Morris</a> writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish <a href="gaberdine">gaberdine</a>. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."

In the middle of the 19th century, <a href="J.%20J.%20Benjamin">J. J. Benjamin</a> wrote about the life of <a href="Persian%20Jews">Persian Jews</a>, describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…."

In 1850 the German composer <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> – who has been called "the inventor of modern antisemitism" – published "<a href="Das%20Judenthum%20in%20der%20Musik">Das Judenthum in der Musik</a>" (roughly "Jewishness in Music") under a <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a> in the "<a href="Neue%20Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Musik">Neue Zeitschrift für Musik</a>". The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a> and <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a>, but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in <a href="Culture%20of%20Germany">German culture</a>, who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly "German" art. The crux was, of course, the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:

According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the <a href="Grimms%27%20Fairy%20Tales">Grimms' Fairy Tales</a> by <a href="Jacob%20Grimm">Jacob</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Grimm">Wilhelm Grimm</a>, published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the <a href="villain">villain</a> of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain" (""Der gute Handel"") and "The Jew Among Thorns" (""Der Jude im Dorn"").

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.

In America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.

The <a href="Dreyfus%20Affair">Dreyfus Affair</a> was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. <a href="Alfred%20Dreyfus">Alfred Dreyfus</a>, a Jewish artillery <a href="wikt%3Acaptain">captain</a> in the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a>, was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a> on <a href="Devil%27s%20Island">Devil's Island</a>. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a> accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.

<a href="Adolf%20Stoecker">Adolf Stoecker</a> (1835–1909), the <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> court chaplain to <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20I">Kaiser Wilhelm I</a>, founded in 1878 an antisemitic, <a href="Liberalism">anti-liberal</a> political party called the <a href="Christian%20Social%20Party%20%28Germany%29">Christian Social Party</a>. This party always remained small, and its support dwindled after Stoecker's death, with most of its members eventually joining larger conservative groups such as the <a href="German%20National%20People%27s%20Party">German National People's Party</a>.

Some scholars view <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx's</a> essay "<a href="On%20The%20Jewish%20Question">On The Jewish Question</a>" as antisemitic, and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings. These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea. Some further argue that the essay influenced <a href="Nazism">National Socialist</a>, as well as Soviet and Arab antisemites. Marx himself had Jewish ancestry, and <a href="Albert%20Lindemann">Albert Lindemann</a> and <a href="Hyam%20Maccoby">Hyam Maccoby</a> have suggested that he was <a href="Self-hating%20Jew">embarrassed by it</a>. Others argue that Marx consistently supported Prussian Jewish communities' struggles to achieve equal political rights. These scholars argue that "On the Jewish Question" is a critique of Bruno Bauer's arguments that Jews must convert to Christianity before being emancipated, and is more generally a critique of liberal rights discourses and capitalism. Iain Hamphsher-Monk wrote that "This work [On The Jewish Question] has been cited as evidence for Marx's supposed anti-semitism, but only the most superficial reading of it could sustain such an interpretation." David McLellan and <a href="Francis%20Wheen">Francis Wheen</a> argue that readers should interpret "On the Jewish Question" in the deeper context of Marx's debates with <a href="Bruno%20Bauer">Bruno Bauer</a>, author of "<a href="The%20Jewish%20Question">The Jewish Question</a>", about <a href="Jewish%20emancipation">Jewish emancipation</a> in Germany. Wheen says that "Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians". According to McLellan, Marx used the word "Judentum" colloquially, as meaning "commerce", arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the <a href="capitalist%20mode%20of%20production%20%28Marxist%20theory%29">capitalist mode of production</a> not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as "an extended pun at Bauer's expense".

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the upward social mobility of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the USA, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of <a href="Leo%20Frank">Leo Frank</a> by a mob of prominent citizens in <a href="Marietta%2C%20Georgia">Marietta, Georgia</a> in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States. The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> which had been inactive since 1870.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the <a href="Menahem%20Mendel%20Beilis">Beilis Trial</a> in Russia represented incidents of <a href="blood%20libel">blood-libel</a> in Europe. Christians used allegations of Jews killing Christians as a justification for the killing of Jews.

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the interwar period. The pioneer automobile manufacturer <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper "<a href="The%20Dearborn%20Independent">The Dearborn Independent</a>" (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of <a href="Father%20Coughlin">Father Coughlin</a> in the late 1930s attacked <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: <a href="Louis%20T.%20McFadden">Louis T. McFadden</a>, Chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Banking%20and%20Currency">United States House Committee on Banking and Currency</a>, blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>, and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".

In the early 1940s the <a href="aviator">aviator</a> <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> and many prominent Americans led The <a href="America%20First%20Committee">America First Committee</a> in opposing any involvement in the war against <a href="Fascism">Fascism</a>. During his July 1936 visit to Germany, Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was "more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized". The <a href="German%20American%20Bund">German American Bund</a> held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> uniforms and raised flags featuring <a href="swastika">swastika</a>s alongside American flags.

Sometimes <a href="List%20of%20ethnic%20riots">race riots</a>, as in <a href="Detroit%20race%20riot%20of%201943">Detroit in 1943</a>, targeted Jewish businesses for looting and burning.

In Germany, <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a> led <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>, who came to power on 30 January 1933 shortly afterwards instituted repressive legislation which denied the Jews basic civil rights. In 1935, the <a href="Nuremberg%20Laws">Nuremberg Laws</a> prohibited sexual relations and marriages between "Aryans" and Jews as "<a href="Rassenschande">Rassenschande</a>" ("race disgrace") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, of their citizenship, (their official title became "subjects of the state"). It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed "<a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>", in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched. Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to German-occupied Europe in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions. In the east the Third Reich forced Jews into ghettos in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>, <a href="Lvov">Lvov</a>, <a href="Lublin">Lublin</a> and <a href="Radom">Radom</a>. After the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 a campaign of mass murder, conducted by the <a href="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a>, culminated from 1942 to 1945 in systematic <a href="genocide">genocide</a>: <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. Eleven million Jews were targeted for extermination by the Nazis, and some six million were eventually killed.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, starting with the conflict between <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a> and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. Antisemitism in the USSR reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the "<a href="rootless%20cosmopolitan">rootless cosmopolitan</a>" (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested. This culminated in the so-called <a href="Doctors%27%20Plot">Doctors' Plot</a> (1952–1953). Similar antisemitic propaganda in Poland resulted in the flight of Polish Jewish survivors from the country.

After the war, the <a href="Kielce%20pogrom">Kielce pogrom</a> and the "<a href="March%201968%20events">March 1968 events</a>" in communist Poland represented further incidents of antisemitism in Europe. The <a href="Anti-Jewish%20violence%20in%20Poland%2C%201944%E2%80%931946">anti-Jewish violence in postwar Poland</a> has a common theme of <a href="blood%20libel">blood libel</a> rumours.

 Physical assaults against Jews in those countries included beatings, stabbings and other violence, which increased markedly, sometimes resulting in serious injury and death. A 2015 report by the US State Department on religious freedom declared that "European anti-Israel sentiment crossed the line into anti-Semitism."

This rise in antisemitic attacks is associated with both the <a href="Muslim%20anti-Semitism">Muslim anti-Semitism</a> and the rise of far-right political parties as a result of the economic crisis of 2008. This rise in the support for far right ideas in western and eastern Europe has resulted in the increase of antisemitic acts, mostly attacks on Jewish memorials, synagogues and cemeteries but also a number of physical attacks against Jews.

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as <a href="blood%20libel">blood libel</a>s. Most of the antisemitic incidents are against Jewish cemeteries and building (community centers and synagogues). Nevertheless, there were several violent attacks against Jews in Moscow in 2006 when a neo-Nazi stabbed 9 people at the Bolshaya Bronnaya Synagogue, the failed bomb attack on the same synagogue in 1999, the threats against Jewish pilgrims in Uman, Ukraine and the attack against a <a href="Menorah%20%28Temple%29">menorah</a> by extremist Christian organization in Moldova in 2009.

Europeans are concerned about antisemitism because, historically, societies with a large degree of anti-Semitism are self-destructive. Furthermore, the Jews of Europe have generally aligned themselves with Europe's democratic elite, a class whose future is uncertain according to the <a href="Economist%20Intelligence%20Unit">Economist Intelligence Unit</a>.

<a href="Robert%20L.%20Bernstein">Robert Bernstein</a>, founder of <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, says that antisemitism is "deeply ingrained and institutionalized" in "Arab nations in modern times."

In a 2011 survey by the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a>, all of the Muslim-majority Middle Eastern countries polled held few positive opinions of Jews. In the questionnaire, only 2% of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ians, 3% of <a href="Lebanon">Lebanese</a> Muslims, and 2% of <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>ians reported having a positive view of Jews. Muslim-majority countries outside the Middle East similarly had few who held positive views of Jews, with 4% of <a href="Turkey">Turks</a> and 9% of <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>ns viewing Jews favorably.

According to a 2011 exhibition at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, United States, some of the dialogue from Middle East media and commentators about Jews bear a striking resemblance to <a href="Nazi%20propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a>. According to Josef Joffe of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>", "anti-Semitism—the real stuff, not just bad-mouthing particular Israeli policies—is as much part of Arab life today as the hijab or the hookah. Whereas this darkest of creeds is no longer tolerated in polite society in the West, in the Arab world, Jew hatred remains culturally endemic."

Muslim clerics in the Middle East have frequently referred to Jews as descendants of apes and pigs, which are conventional epithets for Jews and Christians.

According to professor <a href="Robert%20Wistrich">Robert Wistrich</a>, director of the <a href="Vidal%20Sassoon%20International%20Center%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Antisemitism">Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism</a> (SICSA), the calls for the destruction of Israel by <a href="Iran">Iran</a> or by <a href="Hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="Islamic%20Jihad%20Movement%20in%20Palestine">Islamic Jihad</a>, or the <a href="Muslim%20Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a>, represent a contemporary mode of genocidal antisemitism.

Antisemitism has been explained in terms of <a href="racism">racism</a>, <a href="xenophobia">xenophobia</a>, <a href="Psychological%20Projection">projected guilt</a>, displaced aggression, and the search for a <a href="scapegoat">scapegoat</a>. Some explanations assign partial blame to the perception of Jewish people as unsociable. Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to their own communities, with their own practices and laws.

It has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in <a href="Stereotypes%20of%20Jews%23Greed">stereotypes of Jews</a>), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of <a href="Moneylender">money lending</a> was operated by Jews. Factors contributing to this situation included that Jews were restricted from other professions, while the <a href="Christian%20Church">Christian Church</a> declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral "<a href="usury">usury</a>".

A March 2008 report by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. State Department</a> found that there was an increase in antisemitism across the world, and that both old and new expressions of antisemitism persist. A 2012 report by the U.S. <a href="Bureau%20of%20Democracy%2C%20Human%20Rights%20and%20Labor">Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor</a> also noted a continued global increase in antisemitism, and found that Holocaust denial and opposition to Israeli policy at times was used to promote or justify blatant antisemitism.

Almost all Jews in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> left upon independence in 1962. Algeria's 140,000 Jews had French citizenship since 1870 (briefly revoked by Vichy France in 1940), and they mainly went to <a href="France">France</a>, with some going to <a href="Israel">Israel</a>.

In <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, Dar al-Fadhilah published a translation of <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>'s antisemitic treatise, "<a href="The%20International%20Jew">The International Jew</a>", complete with distinctly antisemitic imagery on the cover.

On 5 May 2001, after <a href="Shimon%20Peres">Shimon Peres</a> visited <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the Egyptian "<a href="Al%20Akhbar%20%28Egypt%29">al-Akhbar</a>" internet paper said that "lies and deceit are not foreign to Jews[...]. For this reason, Allah changed their shape and made them into monkeys and pigs."

In July 2012, Egypt's Al Nahar channel fooled actors into thinking they were on an Israeli television show and filmed their reactions to being told it was an Israeli television show. In response, some of the actors launched into antisemitic rants or dialogue, and many became violent. Actress Mayer El Beblawi said that "Allah did not curse the worm and moth as much as he cursed the Jews" while actor Mahmoud Abdel Ghaffar launched into a violent rage and said, "You brought me someone who looks like a Jew... I hate the Jews to death" after finding out it was a prank.

<a href="Libya">Libya</a> had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of <a href="Tripoli">Libya</a> till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> and most synagogues in the city looted.
Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When <a href="Muammar%20al-Gaddafi">Muammar al-Gaddafi</a> came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.

<a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish communities, in <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic times often living in <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>s known as "<a href="mellah">mellah</a>", have existed in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of 6,000 Jews in <a href="Fez%2C%20Morocco">Fez</a> in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and <a href="Marrakesh">Marrakesh</a> in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232) were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.
In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in <a href="Demnat">Demnat</a>, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.
While the pro-Nazi <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy</a> regime during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> passed discriminatory laws against Jews, <a href="Mohammed%20V%20of%20Morocco">King Muhammad</a> prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)
In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.
In June 1948, soon after <a href="Israel">Israel</a> was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in <a href="Oujda">Oujda</a> and <a href="Djerada">Djerada</a>, killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:
In 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.<a href="http%3A//rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm"></a> By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.
The <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a> in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="North%20America">North America</a> rather than <a href="Israel">Israel</a>.

Antisemitism has been present in history of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> since Europeans first set foot ashore on the <a href="Cape%20Peninsula">Cape Peninsula</a>. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination. Antisemitism reached its apotheosis in the years leading up to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Inspired by the rise of <a href="national%20socialism">national socialism</a> in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> the <a href="Ossewabrandwag">Ossewabrandwag</a> (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a> population – and the National Party faction "New Order" would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.

Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in <a href="Kairouan">Kairouan</a> and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as "hara". Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, <a href="Muhammad%20Bey">Muhammad Bey</a> relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.
Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.
In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and <a href="France">France</a> accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a bomb in <a href="Djerba">Djerba</a> took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a>.

<a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>, former president of Iran, has frequently been accused of denying the Holocaust.

In July, the winner of Iran's first annual International <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> Downfall Cartoon Festival, jointly sponsored by the semi-state-run Iranian media outlet <a href="Fars%20News">Fars News</a>, was an antisemitic cartoon depicting Jews praying before the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>, which is made to look like the <a href="Western%20Wall">Western Wall</a>. Other cartoons in the contest were antisemitic as well. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, condemned the cartoon, stating that "Here's the anti-Semitic notion of Jews and their love for money, the canard that Jews 'control' Wall Street, and a cynical perversion of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism," and "Once again Iran takes the prize for promoting antisemitism."

The Japanese first learned about antisemitism in 1918, during the cooperation of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> with the <a href="White%20movement">White movement</a> in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. <a href="White%20Army%23Structure">White Army</a> soldiers had been issued copies of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion", and "The "Protocols" continue to be used as evidence of Jewish conspiracies even though they are widely acknowledged to be a forgery. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> encouraged Japan to adopt antisemitic policies. In the post-war period, <a href="Extremism">extremist groups</a> and <a href="ideologues">ideologues</a> have promoted <a href="conspiracy%20theories">conspiracy theories</a>.

In 2004, <a href="Al-Manar">Al-Manar</a>, a media network affiliated with <a href="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, aired a drama series, "The Diaspora", which observers allege is based on historical antisemitic allegations. <a href="BBC">BBC</a> correspondents who have watched the program says it quotes extensively from the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion".

Although <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> presently has no substantial Jewish population, the country has reportedly become an example of a phenomenon called "antisemitism without Jews."

In his treatise on Malay identity, "The Malay Dilemma," which was published in 1970, former Malaysian Prime Minister <a href="Mahathir%20Mohamad">Mahathir Mohamad</a> wrote: "The Jews are not only hooked-nosed... but understand money instinctively... Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them the economic control of Europe and provoked antisemitism which waxed and waned throughout Europe through the ages."

The Malay-language <a href="Utusan%20Malaysia">Utusan Malaysia</a> daily stated in an editorial that Malaysians "cannot allow anyone, especially the Jews, to interfere secretly in this country's business... When the drums are pounded hard in the name of human rights, the pro-Jewish people will have their best opportunity to interfere in any Islamic country," the newspaper said. "We might not realize that the enthusiasm to support actions such as demonstrations will cause us to help foreign groups succeed in their mission of controlling this country." Prime Minister <a href="Najib%20Razak">Najib Razak</a>'s office subsequently issued a statement late Monday saying Utusan's claim did "not reflect the views of the government."

In March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," to the extent that they are "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA." In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is "going on all the time" and that it is "worrying and disturbing." At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews." In August 2014, the <a href="Hamas">Hamas</a>' spokesman in Doha said on live television that <a href="Blood%20libel">Jews use blood to make matzos</a>.

The U.S. State Department's first Report on Global Anti-Semitism mentioned a strong feeling of antisemitism in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. In Pakistan, a country without Jewish communities, antisemitic sentiment fanned by antisemitic articles in the press is widespread.

In Pakistan, Jews are often regarded as miserly. After Israel's independence in 1948, violent incidents occurred against Pakistan's small Jewish community of about 2,000 <a href="Bene%20Israel">Bene Israel</a> Jews. The <a href="Magain%20Shalome%20Synagogue">Magain Shalome Synagogue</a> in Karachi was attacked, as were individual Jews. The persecution of Jews resulted in their exodus via India to Israel (see <a href="Pakistanis%20in%20Israel">Pakistanis in Israel</a>), the UK, Canada and other countries. The <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a> Jewish community ceased to exist although a small community reportedly still exists in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>.

A substantial number of people in Pakistan believe that the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> on the World Trade Center in New York were a secret Jewish conspiracy organized by Israel's <a href="MOSSAD">MOSSAD</a>, as were the <a href="7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, allegedly perpetrated by Jews in order to discredit Muslims. Pakistani <a href="political%20commentator">political commentator</a> <a href="Zaid%20Hamid">Zaid Hamid</a> claimed that Indian Jews perpetrated the <a href="2008%20Mumbai%20attacks">2008 Mumbai attacks</a>. Such allegations echo traditional antisemitic theories.
The Jewish religious movement of <a href="Chabad%20Lubavich">Chabad Lubavich</a> had a <a href="Nariman%20House">mission house</a> in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="India">India</a> that was attacked in the <a href="2008%20Mumbai%20attacks">2008 Mumbai attacks</a>, perpetrated by militants connected to Pakistan led by <a href="Ajmal%20Kasab">Ajmal Kasab</a>, a Pakistani national. <a href="Antisemitic">Antisemitic</a> intents were evident from the testimonies of Kasab following his arrest and trial.

People with either Israeli passports or Israeli stamps in their passport are not allowed to visit Saudi Arabia.
<a href="Saudi-Arabian%20textbook%20controversy">Saudi textbooks</a> vilify Jews, call Jews apes (and Christians swine); demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in <a href="Jihad">Jihad</a> to vanquish Jews.
Saudi Arabian government officials and state religious leaders often promote the idea that Jews are conspiring to take over the entire world; as proof of their claims they publish and frequently cite "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" as factual.

In recent decades, synagogues have been targeted in a number of terrorist attacks. In 2003, the <a href="Neve%20Shalom%20Synagogue">Neve Shalom Synagogue</a> was targeted in a car bombing, killing 21 Turkish Muslims and 6 Jews.

In June 2011, the "Economist" suggested that "The best way for Turks to promote democracy would be to vote against the ruling party". Not long after, the Turkish Prime Minister, <a href="Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan">Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a>, said that "The International media, as they are supported by Israel, would not be happy with the continuation of the AKP government". The "Hurriyet Daily News" quoted Erdoğan at the time as claiming "The Economist is part of an Israeli conspiracy that aims to topple the Turkish government".
Moreover, during Erdogan's tenure, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler's</a> "<a href="Mein%20Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>" has once again become a best selling book in Turkey. Prime Minister Erdogan called antisemitism a "crime against humanity." He also said that "as a minority, they're our citizens. Both their security and the right to observe their faith are under our guarantee."

According to a 2004 report from the <a href="Jerusalem%20Center%20for%20Public%20Affairs">Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs</a>, antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe. The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.

Some claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20conflict">Arab-Israeli conflict</a> since the majority of the perpetrators are from the <a href="Islam%20in%20Europe">large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities</a>. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents. According to "The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism", most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.

On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>, Lord <a href="Jonathan%20Sacks">Jonathan Sacks</a>, warned that what he called a "tsunami of antisemitism" was spreading globally. In an interview with <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>, Sacks said: "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable."

Following an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the <a href="Toulouse%20and%20Montauban%20shootings">deadly shooting of three children</a> at a Jewish school in France, the <a href="European%20Jewish%20Congress">European Jewish Congress</a> demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, "We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation. All these smaller attacks remind me of smaller tremors before a massive earthquake. The Jewish community cannot afford to be subject to an earthquake and the authorities cannot say that the writing was not on the wall." He added that European countries should take legislative efforts to ban any form of <a href="incitement">incitement</a>, as well as to equip the authorities with the necessary tools to confront any attempt to expand <a href="terrorist">terrorist</a> and violent activities against Jewish communities in Europe.

France is home to the continent's largest Jewish community (about 600,000). Jewish leaders decry an intensifying antisemitism in France, mainly among Muslims of <a href="Arab">Arab</a> or African heritage, but also growing among <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> islanders from former French colonies. Former Interior Minister <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> denounced the killing of <a href="Ilan%20Halimi">Ilan Halimi</a> on 13 February 2006 as an antisemitic crime.

Jewish philanthropist Baron <a href="Eric%20de%20Rothschild">Eric de Rothschild</a> suggests that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Jerusalem%20Post">The Jerusalem Post</a>" he says that "the one thing you can't say is that France is an anti-Semitic country."

In March 2012, Mohammed Merah <a href="Toulouse%20and%20Montauban%20shootings">opened fire at a Jewish school</a> in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children. An 8-year-old girl was shot in the head at point blank range. President <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> said that it was "obvious" it was an antisemitic attack and that, "I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them. All of France is by their side." The Israeli Prime Minister condemned the "despicable anti-Semitic" murders. After a 32-hour siege and standoff with the police outside his house, and a French raid, Merah jumped off a balcony and was shot in the head and killed. Merah told police during the standoff that he intended to keep on attacking, and he loved death the way the police loved life. He also claimed connections with al-Qaeda.

4 months later, in July 2012, a French Jewish teenager wearing a "distinctive religious symbol" was the victim of a violent antisemitic attack on a train travelling between Toulouse and Lyon. The teen was first verbally harassed and later beaten up by two assailants. <a href="Richard%20Prasquier">Richard Prasquier</a> from the French Jewish umbrella group, <a href="Conseil%20Repr%C3%A9sentatif%20des%20Institutions%20juives%20de%20France">CRIF</a>, called the attack "another development in the worrying trend of anti-Semitism in our country."

Another incident in July 2012 dealt with the vandalism of the synagogue of <a href="Noisy-le-Grand">Noisy-le-Grand</a> of the <a href="Seine-Saint-Denis">Seine-Saint-Denis</a> district in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. The synagogue was vandalized three times in a ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L’Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and I think that we need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed."

In August 2012, <a href="Abraham%20Cooper">Abraham Cooper</a>, the dean of the <a href="Simon%20Wiesenthal%20Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a>, met French Interior Minister <a href="Manuel%20Valls">Manuel Valls</a> and reported that antisemitic attacks against French Jews increased by 40% since <a href="Toulouse%20and%20Montauban%20shootings">Merah's shooting spree</a> in <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>. Cooper pressed Valls to take extra measures to secure the safety of French Jews, as well as to discuss strategies to foil an increasing trend of lone-wolf terrorists on the Internet.

The Interior Minister of Germany, <a href="Wolfgang%20Sch%C3%A4uble">Wolfgang Schäuble</a>, points out the official policy of Germany: "We will not tolerate any form of extremism, xenophobia or anti-Semitism." Although the number of extreme right-wing groups and organisations grew from 141 (2001) to 182 (2006), especially in the formerly communist East Germany, <a href="Fight%20Against%20The%20Right">Germany's measures against right-wing groups</a> and antisemitism are effective, despite Germany having the highest rates of antisemitic acts in Europe. According to the annual reports of the <a href="Bundesamt%20f%C3%BCr%20Verfassungsschutz">Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution</a> the overall number of far-right extremists in Germany dropped during the last years from 49,700 (2001), 45,000 (2002), 41,500 (2003), 40,700 (2004), 39,000 (2005), to 38,600 in 2006. Germany provided several million euros to fund "nationwide programs aimed at fighting far-right extremism, including teams of traveling consultants, and victims' groups."

In July 2012, two women were assaulted in Germany, sprayed with tear gas, and were shown a "<a href="Nazi%20salute">Hitler salute</a>," apparently because of a <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a> necklace that they wore.

In late August 2012, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> police investigated an attack on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old daughter, allegedly by four Arab teens, after which the rabbi needed treatment for head wounds at a hospital. The police classified the attack as a hate crime. "Jüdische Allgemeine" reported that the rabbi was wearing a <a href="kippah">kippah</a> and was approached by one of the teens, who asked the rabbi if he was Jewish. The teen then attacked the rabbi while yelling antisemitic comments, and threatened to kill the rabbi's daughter. Berlin’s mayor condemned the attack, saying that "Berlin is an international city in which intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are not being tolerated. Police will undertake all efforts to find and arrest the perpetrators."

In October 2012, various historians, including Dr. Julius H. Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish historian and a member of the German Interior Ministry’s commission to combat antisemitism, charged the majority of <a href="Bundestag">Bundestag</a> deputies with failing to understand antisemitism and the imperativeness of periodic legislative reports on German antisemitism. Schoeps cited various antisemitic statements by German parliament members as well. The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse "latent anti-Semitism," but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.

Antisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent <a href="Greek%20government-debt%20crisis">Greek government-debt crisis</a> has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure <a href="Golden%20Dawn%20%28Greece%29">Golden Dawn</a>.
Jews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 <a href="Sephardic%20Jews">Sephardic Jews</a> settled in <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a> after an invitation from the <a href="Ottoman%20Sultan">Ottoman Sultan</a> in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. 
According to the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">ADL</a> (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the "ADL Global 100", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that "Jews have too much power in the business world".
In March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published. Its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum.

In the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party <a href="Jobbik">Jobbik</a>, which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Trianon">Treaty of Trianon</a>, Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the "Jewish banker class".

The ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of <a href="antisemitism%20in%20the%2021st%20century">antisemitism in the 21st century</a>, and in Italy as well. The <a href="Second%20Intifada">Second Intifada</a>, which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes. In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate of the peace process and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).

The <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, it is difficult to obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. "Jew" or "Israel". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression. There are approximately 52 000 <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch Jews</a>. According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, the number of antisemitic incidents in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> was 14 in 2008 and 30 in 2009. In 2010, Raphaël Evers, an <a href="Orthodox%20judaism">orthodox</a> rabbi in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, told the <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> newspaper <a href="Aftenposten">Aftenposten</a> that Jews can no longer be safe in the city anymore due to the risk of violent assaults. "We Jews no longer feel at home here in the Netherlands. Many people talk about moving to Israel," he said.

According to the <a href="Anne%20Frank%20Foundation">Anne Frank Foundation</a>, antisemitism in the Netherlands in 2011 was roughly at the same level as in 2010. Actual antisemitic incidents increased from 19 in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Verbal antisemitic incidents dropped slightly from 1173 in 2010 to 1098 in 2011. This accounts for 75%–80% of all verbal racist incidents in the Netherlands. Antisemitism is more prevalent in the age group 23–27 years, which is a younger group than that of racist incidents in general.

In 2010, the <a href="Norwegian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation</a> after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> for his killing of <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students" and that "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>". Additionally, "while some students might protest when some express support for <a href="terrorism">terrorism</a>, none object when students express hate of Jews", saying that it says in "the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and <a href="lynching">hung</a> because he was a Jew".

Norwegian Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen referred to the antisemitism reported in this study as being "completely unacceptable." The head of a local Islamic council joined Jewish leaders and Halvorsen in denouncing such antisemitism.

In October 2012, the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-Operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe</a> issued a report regarding antisemitism in Norway, criticizing Norway for an increase in antisemitism in the country and blaming Norwegian officials for failing to address antisemitism."

The <a href="University%20of%20Warsaw">University of Warsaw</a>’s study in 2016 found that 37% of surveyed Poles expressed negative attitudes towards Jews (up from 32% in 2015); 56% said that they wouldn't accept a Jew in their family (up from 46%); and 32% wouldn't want Jewish neighbors (up from 27%).

In November 2015, following Antoni Macierewicz’s (<a href="Law%20and%20Justice">Law and Justice</a> party) designation as Minister of National Defence, he faced allegations of antisemitism and protests by the <a href="Anti%20Defamation%20League">Anti Defamation League</a>. In 1996 Macierewicz asserted that Poles did not murder Jews in the <a href="Kielce%20pogrom">Kielce pogrom</a> in 1946. In 2001, Macierewicz wrote: "Is the hubbub surrounding <a href="Jedwabne%20pogrom">Jedwabne</a> intended to eclipse the responsibility of Jews for Communism and the Soviet occupation?" In a radio interview in 2002 Macierewicz said, in response to a caller’s question, that he had read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

Antisemitism in <a href="Russia">Russia</a> refers to acts of hostility against <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Russia">Jews in Russia</a> and the promotion of antisemitic views in the country since the end of the Soviet Union.

After Germany and Austria, Sweden has the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe, though the Netherlands has reported a higher rate of antisemitism in some years. A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: "The Jews have too much influence in the world today". 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims "harbour systematic antisemitic views". The former prime minister <a href="G%C3%B6ran%20Persson">Göran Persson</a> described these results as "surprising and terrifying". However, the rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said that "It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the <a href="Palestinian%20people">Palestinians</a> to be."

In 2009, a synagogue that served the Jewish community in Malmö was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused while returning home from prayer, and masked men mockingly chanted "Hitler" in the streets. As a result of security concerns, Malmö's synagogue has guards and rocket-proof glass in the windows, and the Jewish kindergarten can only be reached through thick steel security doors.

In early 2010, the Swedish publication "The Local" published series of articles about the growing antisemitism in <a href="Malm%C3%B6%2C%20Sweden">Malmö, Sweden</a>. In 2009, the Malmö police received reports of 79 antisemitic incidents, which was twice the number of the previous year (2008). Fredrik Sieradzki, spokesman for the Malmö Jewish community, estimated that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year. "Malmö is a place to move away from," he said, citing antisemitism as the primary reason. In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told "Die Presse", an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being "harassed and physically attacked" by "people from the Middle East," although he added that only a small number of Malmö's 40,000 Muslims "exhibit hatred of Jews." In October 2010, "The Forward" reported on the current state of Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and professor of history at the University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Judith Popinski, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. In December 2010, the <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> organization <a href="Simon%20Wiesenthal%20Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express "extreme caution" when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an alleged increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens in the city of <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a>. <a href="Ilmar%20Reepalu">Ilmar Reepalu</a>, the mayor of Malmö for over 15 years, has been accused of failing to protect the Jewish community in Malmö, causing 30 Jewish families to leave the city in 2010, and more preparing to leave, which has left the possibility that Malmö's Jewish community will disappear soon. Critics of Reepalu say that his statements, such as antisemitism in Malmö actually being an "understandable" consequence of Israeli policy in the Middle East, have encouraged young Muslims to abuse and harass the Jewish community. In an interview with "the Sunday Telegraph" in February 2010, Reepalu said, "There haven't been any attacks on Jewish people, and if Jews from the city want to move to Israel that is not a matter for Malmö," which renewed concerns about Reepalu.

<a href="Oleh%20Tyahnybok">Oleh Tyahnybok</a>, the leader of the far-right <a href="Svoboda%20%28political%20party%29">Svoboda</a> party, whose members hold senior positions in <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Ukraine">Ukraine's government</a>, urged his party to fight "the Moscow-Jewish mafia ruling Ukraine." The "Algemeiner Journal" reported: "Svoboda supporters include among their heroes leaders of pro-Nazi World War II organizations known for their <a href="The%20Holocaust%20in%20Ukraine">atrocities against Jews</a> and <a href="Massacres%20of%20Poles%20in%20Volhynia%20and%20Eastern%20Galicia">Poles</a>, such as the <a href="Organization%20of%20Ukrainian%20Nationalists">Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists</a> (OUN), the <a href="Ukrainian%20Insurgent%20Army">Ukrainian Insurgent Army</a> (UPA), and the <a href="14th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20%281st%20Ukrainian%29">14th Waffen-SS Galicia Division</a>."

According to <a href="The%20Simon%20Wiesenthal%20Center">The Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> (in January 2011) "Ukraine has, to the best of our knowledge, never conducted a single investigation of a local Nazi war criminal, let alone prosecuted a Holocaust perpetrator."

According to "Der Spiegel", <a href="Dmytro%20Yarosh">Dmytro Yarosh</a>, leader of the far-right <a href="Right%20Sector">Right Sector</a>, wrote: "I wonder how it came to pass that most of the billionaires in Ukraine are Jews?" Late February 2014 Yarosh pledged during a meeting with <a href="Israel">Israel</a>’s ambassador in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> to fight all forms of racism. Right Sector's leader for West Ukraine, <a href="Oleksandr%20Muzychko">Oleksandr Muzychko</a>, has talked about fighting "communists, Jews and Russians for as long as blood flows in my veins." Muzychko was shot dead on 24 March 2014. An official inquiry concluded he had shot himself in the heart at the end of a chase with the <a href="Ukrainian%20police">Ukrainian police</a>.

In April 2014, <a href="Donetsk">Donetsk</a> Chief Rabbi Pinchas Vishedski said that "Anti-Semitic incidents in the Russian-speaking east were rare, unlike in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> and western Ukraine." An April 2014 listing of anti-Jewish violence in Ukraine in "<a href="Haaretz">Haaretz</a>" no incidents outside this "Russian-speaking east" were mentioned.

According to the Israel's Ambassador to Ukraine, the antisemitism occurs here much less frequently than in other European countries, and has more a hooligan's nature rather than a system.

In 2017 a <a href="Institute%20for%20Jewish%20Policy%20Research">Institute for Jewish Policy Research</a> survey found that the levels of anti-Semitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world, with 2.4% expressing multiple anti-Semitic attitudes, and about 70% having a favourable opinion of Jews. However, only 17% had a favourable opinion of Israel, with 33% holding an unfavourable view.

In 2017, a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the previous year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK. Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the <a href="Criminal%20charge">charging</a> of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change."

Every years since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by <a href="YouGov">YouGov</a> concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in publlic. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, far-left antisemitism and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the <a href="Crown%20Prosecution%20Service">Crown Prosecution Service</a> was not doing enough.

In 2016, the <a href="Home%20Affairs%20Select%20Committee">Home Affairs Select Committee</a> held an inquiry into the rise of antisemitism in the UK. The inquiry called <a href="Jeremy%20Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, <a href="Ken%20Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a> and others to give evidence. In 2005, a group of British <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Members of Parliament</a> set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that "until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. The inquiry was reconstituted following a surge in antisemitic incidents in Britain during the summer of 2014, and the new inquiry published its report in 2015, making recommendations for reducing antisemitism.

Although antisemitism in Canada is less prevalent than in many other countries, there have been recent incidents. For example, a 2004 study identified 24 incidents of antisemitism between 14 March and 14 July 2004 in Newfoundland, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and some smaller Ontario communities. The incidents included vandalism and other attacks on four synagogues, six cemeteries, four schools, and a number of businesses and private residences.

In November 2005, the <a href="U.S.%20Commission%20on%20Civil%20Rights">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</a> examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Education">U.S. Department of Education</a>'s <a href="Office%20for%20Civil%20Rights">Office for Civil Rights</a> protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of "Title VI" of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and further recommended that <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.

On 19 September 2006, <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> founded the <a href="Yale%20Initiative%20for%20the%20Interdisciplinary%20Study%20of%20Anti-Semitism">Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism</a> (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director <a href="Charles%20A.%20Small">Charles Small</a> of the Center cited the increase in antisemitism worldwide in recent years as generating a "need to understand the current manifestation of this disease". In June 2011, Yale voted to close this initiative. After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. <a href="Donald%20Green">Donald Green</a>, then head of Yale’s Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students. As with other programs that had been in a similar situation, the initiative had therefore been cancelled. This decision has been criticized by figures such as former U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Staff Director <a href="Kenneth%20L.%20Marcus">Kenneth L. Marcus</a>, who is now the director of the Initiative to Combat Anti-Semitism and Anti-Israelism in America’s Educational Systems at the Institute for Jewish and Community Research, and <a href="Deborah%20Lipstadt">Deborah Lipstadt</a>, who described the decision as "weird" and "strange." <a href="Antony%20Lerman">Antony Lerman</a> has supported Yale's decision, describing the YIISA as a politicized initiative that was devoted to the promotion of Israel rather than to serious research on antisemitism.

A 2007 survey by the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, "with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views." The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of <a href="Jesus">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanics</a> and 32% of <a href="African%20American">African-Americans</a> hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.

A 2009 study published in "<a href="Boston%20Review">Boston Review</a>" found that nearly 25% of non-Jewish Americans blamed Jews for the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202008%E2%80%932009">financial crisis of 2008–2009</a>, with a higher percentage among Democrats than Republicans. 32% of Democrats blamed Jews for the financial crisis, versus 18% for Republicans.

In August 2012, the <a href="California%20state%20assembly">California state assembly</a> approved a <a href="non-binding%20resolution">non-binding resolution</a> that "encourages university leaders to combat a wide array of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel actions," although the resolution "is purely symbolic and does not carry policy implications."

In April 2017, "<a href="Politico">Politico Magazine</a>" published an article purporting to show links between U.S. President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, Russian President <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> and the Jewish outreach organization <a href="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a>. The article was widely condemned, with the head of the Anti-Defamation League <a href="Jonathan%20Greenblatt">Jonathan Greenblatt</a> saying that it "evokes age-old myths about Jews".

In a 2009 news story, Michael Rowan and Douglas E. Schoen wrote, "In an infamous Christmas Eve speech several years ago, Chávez said the Jews killed Christ and have been gobbling up wealth and causing poverty and injustice worldwide ever since." <a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Hugo Chávez</a> stated that "[t]he world is for all of us, then, but it so happens that a minority, the descendants of the same ones that crucified Christ, the descendants of the same ones that kicked <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Bolívar</a> out of here and also crucified him in their own way over there in Santa Marta, in Colombia.

Economy of Azerbaijan

<a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> has an economy that has completed its post-Soviet transition into a major oil based economy (with the completion of the <a href="Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan%20pipeline">Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline</a>), from one where the state played the major role. Azerbaijan's GDP grew 41.7% in the first quarter of 2007, possibly the highest of any nation worldwide.
Such rates cannot be sustained, but despite reaching 26.4% in 2005 (second highest <a href="GDP">GDP</a> growth in the world in 2005 only to <a href="Equatorial%20Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>), and 2006 over 34.6% (world highest), in 2008 dropped to 10.8%, and dropped further to 9.3% in 2009. The real GDP growth rate for 2011 was expected at 3.7% but had dropped to 0.1%.
Large <a href="Petroleum">oil</a> reserves are a major contributor to the economy. The national currency, the <a href="Azerbaijani%20manat">Azerbaijani manat</a>, was stable in 2000, depreciating 3.8% against the dollar. The budget deficit equaled 1.3% of GDP in 2000.

Progress on economic reform has generally lagged behind <a href="macroeconomic">macroeconomic</a> stabilization. The government has undertaken regulatory reforms in some areas, including substantial opening of trade policy, but inefficient public administration in which commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the impact of these reforms. The government has largely completed <a href="privatization">privatization</a> of agricultural lands and small and medium-sized enterprises. In August 2000, the government launched a second-stage privatization program, in which many large state enterprises will be privatized. Since 2001, the economic activity in the country is regulated by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Economic%20Development%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Ministry of Economic Development of Azerbaijan Republic</a>.

Through the Soviet period, Azerbaijan had always been more developed industrially than Armenia and Georgia, two neighboring Transcaucasia countries - but also less diversified, as a result of slow investment in non-oil sector. With a history of industrial development of more than 100 years, Azerbaijan proved to be a leading nation in Southern Caucasus throughout the turmoil of Soviet Union collapse in early 1990s until nowadays.

Oil remains the most prominent product of Azerbaijan's economy with cotton, natural gas and agriculture products contributing to its economic growth over the last five years. More than $60 billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil by major international oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by <a href="BP">BP</a>. Oil production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November 1997 and now is about 500,000 b/d. People visit petroleum spas (or "oil spas") to bathe in the local crude in <a href="Naftalan%2C%20Azerbaijan">Naftalan</a> A leading <a href="caviar">caviar</a> producer and exporter in the past, Azerbaijan's <a href="fishing%20industry">fishing industry</a> today is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a> and <a href="beluga%20%28sturgeon%29">beluga</a> in the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>.

Azerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a <a href="command%20economy">command</a> to a <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a>, but its energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Azerbaijan has begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> region.

In 1992, Azerbaijan became member of the <a href="Economic%20Cooperation%20Organization">Economic Cooperation Organization</a>. In 2002, the Azerbaijani <a href="merchant%20marine">merchant marine</a> had 54 ships. In March 2001, Azerbaijan concluded a <a href="gas">gas</a> agreement with Turkey, providing a future export market for Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan has concluded 21 production-sharing agreements with various oil companies. An export pipeline that transports Caspian oil to the Mediterranean from <a href="Baku">Baku</a> through <a href="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> to <a href="Ceyhan">Ceyhan</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> (the <a href="Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan%20pipeline">Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline</a>) became operational in 2006. The pipeline is expected to generate as much as $160 billion in revenues for the country over the next 30 years. The recent high price of oil is highly beneficial to Azerbaijan's economy as the nation is in the midst of an oil boom. Eastern Caspian producers in Kazakhstan also have expressed interest in accessing this pipeline to transport a portion of their production.

In 2010, Azerbaijan entered into the top eight biggest oil suppliers to EU countries with €9.46 billion. In 2011, the amount of foreign investments in Azerbaijan was $20 billion, a 61% increase from 2010. According to <a href="Ministry%20of%20Economic%20Development%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Minister of Economic Development of Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="Shahin%20Mustafayev">Shahin Mustafayev</a>, in 2011, "$15.7 billion was invested in the non-oil sector, while the rest - in the oil sector."
In 2012, because of its economic performance after the Soviet breakup, Azerbaijan was predicted to become "<a href="Tiger%20economy">Tiger of Caucasus</a>". In 2012, <a href="Globalization%20and%20World%20Cities%20Research%20Network">Globalization and World Cities Research Network</a> study ranked Baku as a Gamma-level <a href="global%20city">global city</a>.

In 2015, Turkey and Azerbaijan agreed to boost mutual trade to USD$15 billion by 2023.

The following is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Azerbaijan at market prices with figures in USD.
For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar was exchanged at 1,565.88 Manats only. Currently, the new Manat is in use, with an exchange rate of about 1 manat = $1.10. Mean graduate pay was $5.76 per manhour in 2010.

For more than a century the backbone of the Azerbaijani economy has been <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a>, which represented 50 percent of Azerbaijan’s GDP in 2005, and is projected to double to almost 125 percent of GDP in 2007. Now that Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviets</a> because of poor technology, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important areas in the world for oil exploration and development. Proven <a href="oil%20reserves">oil reserves</a> in the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Basin</a>, which Azerbaijan shares with <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, are comparable in size to the <a href="North%20Sea%20oil">North Sea</a>, although exploration is still in the early stages.

Azerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region. About 54,9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural lands. At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of utilized agricultural area. In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m³. Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> crops, <a href="leaf%20vegetable">leaf vegetable</a>s, <a href="viticulture">viticulture</a> and <a href="Azerbaijani%20wine">wine-making</a>, cotton growing and <a href="medicinal%20plants">medicinal plants</a>. In some lands it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, <a href="sugar%20beet">sugar beet</a>s, cotton and tobacco. Livestock, <a href="dairy%20product">dairy product</a>s, and wine and <a href="Distilled%20beverage">spirits</a> are also important farm products. The Caspian <a href="fishing%20industry">fishing industry</a> is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a> and <a href="Beluga%20%28sturgeon%29">beluga</a>.

Some portions of most products that were previously imported from abroad have begun to be produced locally (among them are Coca Cola by Coca Cola Bottlers LTD, beer by Baki-Kastel, parquet by Nehir and oil pipes by EUPEC Pipe Coating Azerbaijan).

New program which is prepared by the Europe Union is aimed to support economic diversification of Azerbaijan.Program is considered for southern region Lankaran which has the lowest economic indicator and the lowest income per capita, as well as, the lowest level of investment, but at the same time, high potential for the production of garden products in high quality.The program will be focused on the development of the region at the local and international levels. 

In 2007, mining and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95 per cent of the Azerbaijani economy. Diversification of the economy into manufacturing industries remain a long-term issue.

As of late 2000s, the defense industry of Azerbaijan has emerged as an autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability. The ministry is cooperating with the defense sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan. Along with other contracts, Azerbaijani defence industries and Turkish companies, Azerbaijan will produce 40mm revolver grenade launchers, 107mm and 122mm MLRS systems, Cobra 4×4 vehicles and joint modernization of BTR vehicles in Baku.

The <a href="Economic%20growth">GDP growth rates</a> observed in Azerbaijan during last years made the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world. But the banking sector of Azerbaijan has yet to tap the vast growth potential that should be achievable due to the continuation of the high economic growth. For this reason the banking sector remains small in relation to the size of the Azerbaijani economy. Since 2002, important stages of <a href="restructuring">restructuring</a> of the banking system have started to be carried out. Taking into consideration entry of big oil revenues in the country, as a logical result of successful oil strategy, and in this base, as the banks were ready to an effective transfer of their financial resources to the strategic goals, development strategy was made for 2002–2005.

By 1 April 2010, 47 banks, 631 bank branches function in Azerbaijan. One of banks was founded with participation of state capital, 23 of foreign capital. To the same date, 98 non-bank credit organizations operate in the republic along with banks. Growth of real money incomes of population, development of trust in bank system, improving the legal bases of protection of interests of creditors and depositors, in particular launch of ‘Deposits Insurance Fund’ were the criteria characterizing rapid growth of deposits of population. As of 1 April 2010, <a href="bank%20deposit">bank deposit</a>s of population were equal to 2,4 billion AZN. 33,3% of them were long-term deposits (higher than a year). As of 1 April 2010, bank credits to customers is 8.5 bn AZN, which makes 70.5% of bank assets. Special weight of private sector in structure of credit investments is higher than 82% (7 bn AZN).

In the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in the Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors, and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and <a href="List%20of%20Azerbaijani%20inventions%20and%20discoveries">innovation</a>. The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.

Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing <a href="Internet">Internet</a> sector, mostly uninfluenced by the <a href="2007%E2%80%932012%20global%20financial%20crisis">global financial crisis</a>; rapid growth is forecast for at least five more years.

The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector. The Ministry of Communications & Information Technologies (MCIT), as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom, is both a policy-maker and regulator. Public pay phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks. Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration. As of 2009, there were 1,397,000 main <a href="telephone%20line">telephone line</a>s and 1,485,000 internet users. There are five <a href="GSM">GSM</a> providers: <a href="Azercell">Azercell</a>, <a href="Bakcell">Bakcell</a>, Azerfon (<a href="Nar%20Mobile">Nar Mobile</a>), <a href="Aztrank">Aztrank</a>, <a href="Catel">Catel</a> <a href="mobile%20network%20operator">mobile network operator</a>s and one <a href="CDMA">CDMA</a>.

Tourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. However, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">Nagorno-Karabakh War</a> during the 1988-1994 period, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.

It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays. In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism. During winter, the <a href="Shahdag%20Winter%20Complex">Shahdag Winter Complex</a> offers skiing.

The <a href="government%20of%20Azerbaijan">government of Azerbaijan</a> has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination a top priority. It is a national strategy to make tourism a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy. These activities are regulated by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Culture%20and%20Tourism%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan</a>.

The <a href="Azerbaijani%20manat">Azerbaijani manat</a> is the currency of Azerbaijani, denominated as the <a href="Azerbaijani%20manat">manat</a>, subdivided into 100 <a href="Azerbaijani%20manat">qapik</a>. The manat is issued by the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20Azerbaijan">Central Bank of Azerbaijan</a>, the monetary authority of Azerbaijan. The <a href="ISO%204217">ISO 4217</a> abbreviation is AZN. The Latinised symbol is ().

The manat is held in a floating <a href="exchange-rate">exchange-rate</a> system managed primarily against the <a href="US%20dollar">US dollar</a>. The <a href="Exchange%20rate">rate of exchange</a> (Azerbaijani manat per US$1) for 28 January 2016, was AZN 1.60.

There is a complex relationship between Azerbaijan's <a href="balance%20of%20trade">balance of trade</a>, inflation, measured by the <a href="consumer%20price%20index">consumer price index</a> and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the manat to "float", Azerbaijan's <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a> has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies.

Two thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas. The region of the <a href="Lesser%20Caucasus">Lesser Caucasus</a> accounts for most of the country's gold, silver, iron, copper, <a href="titanium">titanium</a>, <a href="chromium">chromium</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>, <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, complex <a href="ore">ore</a> and <a href="antimony">antimony</a>. In September 1994, a 30-year contract was signed between the <a href="State%20Oil%20Company%20of%20Azerbaijan%20Republic">State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic</a> (SOCAR) and 13 oil companies, among them <a href="Amoco">Amoco</a>, <a href="BP">BP</a>, <a href="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a>, <a href="Lukoil">Lukoil</a> and <a href="Statoil">Statoil</a>. As Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater <a href="oil%20field">oilfields</a> untouched by the Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important spots in the world for <a href="Hydrocarbon%20exploration">oil exploration</a> and development. Meanwhile, the <a href="State%20Oil%20Fund%20of%20Azerbaijan">State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan</a> was established as an extra-budgetary fund to ensure the <a href="macroeconomy">macroeconomic</a> stability, transparency in the management of oil revenue, and the safeguarding of resources for future generations.

Azeriqaz, a sub-company of SOCAR, intends to ensure full gasification of the country by 2021.

The convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> and the South-North corridor, highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country’s economy. The transport sector in the country includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport.

Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials. The <a href="Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan%20pipeline">Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline</a> (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets. The <a href="South%20Caucasus%20Pipeline">South Caucasus Pipeline</a>, also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the <a href="Shah%20Deniz%20gas%20field">Shah Deniz gas field</a>. Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.

In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Transportation%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Ministry of Transport</a> with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions. In the same year, the country became a member of the <a href="Vienna%20Convention%20on%20Road%20Traffic">Vienna Convention on Road Traffic</a>. The highest priority being; upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country, as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.

In 2012, the construction of <a href="Kars%E2%80%93Tbilisi%E2%80%93Baku%20railway">Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway</a> expected to provide transportation between Asia and Europe through connecting the railways of China and <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> in the east with Turkey's <a href="Marmaray">Marmaray</a> to the European railway system in the west. <a href="Russian%20gauge">Broad gauge</a> railways in 2010 stretched for and <a href="electrified%20railway">electrified railway</a>s numbered . By 2010, there were 35 airports and one <a href="heliport">heliport</a>.

As of October 2014, Azerbaijan holds the highest foreign investment per capita among the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Germany, for example, has invested approximately $760 million into the Azerbaijani economy, and approximately 177 German companies operate within Azerbaijan. Since gaining its independence, companies have invested $174 billion into Azerbaijan. Foreign investment accounts for around half of that amount.

In 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as the top reformer by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>'s <a href="Doing%20Business%20report">Doing Business report</a>:

Geography of Azerbaijan

<a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> is situated in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> region of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. Three physical features dominate Azerbaijan: the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east; the <a href="Greater%20Caucasus">Greater Caucasus</a> mountain range to the north; and the extensive flatlands at the country's center. About the size of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> or the state of <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, Azerbaijan has a total land area of approximately 86,600 square kilometers, less than 1% of the land area of the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Of the three Transcaucasian states, Azerbaijan has the greatest land area. Special administrative subdivisions are the <a href="Nakhchivan%20Autonomous%20Republic">Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic</a>, which is separated from the rest of Azerbaijan by a strip of <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>n territory, and the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region</a>, entirely within Azerbaijan. (The status of Nagorno-Karabakh was under negotiation in 1994.) Located in the region of the southern Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea to the east, Georgia and Russia to the north, Iran to the south, and Armenia to the southwest and west. A small part of Nakhchivan also borders Turkey to the northwest. The capital of Azerbaijan is the ancient city of Baku, which has the largest and best harbor on the Caspian Sea and has long been the center of the republic's oil industry.

The elevation changes over a relatively short distance from lowlands to highlands; nearly half the country is considered mountainous. Notable physical features are the gently undulating hills of the subtropical southeastern coast, which are covered with tea plantations, orange groves, and lemon groves; numerous mud volcanoes and mineral springs in the ravines of <a href="Kobustan%20Mountain">Kobustan Mountain</a> near Baku; and coastal terrain that lies as much as twenty-eight meters below sea level.

Except for its eastern Caspian shoreline and some areas bordering Georgia and Iran, Azerbaijan is ringed by mountains. To the northeast, bordering Russia's Dagestan Autonomous Republic, is the <a href="Greater%20Caucasus">Greater Caucasus</a> range; to the west, bordering Armenia, is the <a href="Lesser%20Caucasus">Lesser Caucasus</a> range. To the extreme southeast, the <a href="Talysh%20Mountains">Talysh Mountains</a> form part of the border with Iran. The highest elevations occur in the Greater Caucasus, where <a href="Bazard%C3%BCz%C3%BC">Mount Bazar-dyuzi</a> rises 4,466 meters above sea level. Eight large rivers flow down from the Caucasus ranges into the central <a href="Kura-Aras%20Lowlands">Kura-Aras Lowlands</a>, alluvial flatlands and low delta areas along the seacoast designated by the Azerbaijani name for the <a href="Mtkvari%20River">Mtkvari River</a> (Kura) and its main tributary, the Aras. The Mtkvari, the longest river in the Caucasus region, forms the delta and drains into the Caspian a short distance downstream from the confluence with the Aras. The <a href="Mingechaur%20Reservoir">Mingechaur Reservoir</a>, with an area of 605 square kilometers that makes it the largest body of water in Azerbaijan, was formed by damming the Kura in western Azerbaijan. The waters of the reservoir provide hydroelectric power and irrigation of the Kura-Aras plain. Most of the country's rivers are not navigable. About 15% of the land in Azerbaijan is arable.

Azerbaijan is nearly surrounded by mountains. The <a href="Greater%20Caucasus">Greater Caucasus</a> range, with the country’s highest elevations, lies in the north along the border with Russia and run southeast to the <a href="Abseron%20Peninsula">Abseron Peninsula</a> on the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. The country’s highest peak, <a href="Bazard%C3%BCz%C3%BC">Bazardyuze Dagi</a>, rises to 4,485 m in this range near the Azerbaijan-Russia border. The <a href="Lesser%20Caucasus">Lesser Caucasus</a> range, with elevations up to 3,500 m, lies to the west along the border with Armenia. The <a href="Talish%20Mountains">Talish Mountains</a> form part of the border with Iran at the southeast tip of the country.

<a href="Kobustan%20Mountain">Kobustan Mountain</a>, located near <a href="Baku">Baku</a>, is carved by deep ravines, from which bubble mud <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es and <a href="mineral%20spring">mineral spring</a>s.

The climate varies from subtropical and humid in the southeast to subtropical and dry in central and eastern Azerbaijan. Along the shores of the Caspian Sea it is temperate, while the higher mountain elevations are generally cold. <a href="Baku">Baku</a>, on the Caspian, enjoys mild weather that averages in January and in July.

Physiographic conditions and different atmosphere circulations admit 8 types of air currents including continental, sea, arctic, tropical currents of air that formulates the climate of the Republic. The maximum annual precipitation falls in Lenkeran (1,600 to 1,800 mm.) and the minimum in Absheron (200 to 350 mm.). The maximum daily precipitation of 334 mm was observed at the Bilieser Station in 1955.

Air and water pollution are widespread and pose great challenges to economic development. Major sources of pollution include oil refineries and chemical and metallurgical industries, which in the early 1990s continued to operate as inefficiently as they had in the Soviet era. Air quality is extremely poor in Baku, the center of oil refining. Some reports have described Baku's air as the most polluted in the former Soviet Union, and other industrial centers suffer similar problems.

The Caspian Sea, including Baku Bay, has been polluted by oil leakages and the dumping of raw or inadequately treated sewage, reducing the yield of caviar and fish. In the Soviet period, Azerbaijan was pressed to use extremely heavy applications of pesticides to improve its output of scarce subtropical crops for the rest of the Soviet Union. The continued regular use of the pesticide DDT in the 1970s and 1980s was an egregious lapse, although that chemical was officially banned in the Soviet Union because of its toxicity to humans. Excessive application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers has caused extensive groundwater pollution and has been linked by Azerbaijani scientists to birth defects and illnesses. Rising water levels in the Caspian Sea, mainly caused by natural factors exacerbated by man-made structures, have reversed the decades-long drying trend and now threaten coastal areas; the average level rose 1.5 meters between 1978 and 1993. Because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, large numbers of trees were felled, roads were built through pristine areas, and large expanses of agricultural land were occupied by military forces.

Like other former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan faces a gigantic environmental cleanup complicated by the economic uncertainties left in the wake of the Moscow-centered planning system. The Committee for the Protection of the Natural Environment is part of the Azerbaijani government, but in the early 1990s it was ineffective at targeting critical applications of limited funds, establishing pollution standards, or monitoring compliance with environmental regulations. Early in 1994, plans called for Azerbaijan to participate in the international Caspian Sea Forum, sponsored by the European Union (EU).

Azerbaijan currently has diplomatic relations with <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120308154531/http%3A//mfa.gov.az/eng/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Btask%3Dview%26amp%3Bid%3D223%26amp%3BItemid%3D1">158</a> countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, the People's Republic of China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Iraq, Republic of Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait, Libya, Luxembourg, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Netherlands,Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Qatar, Republic of India, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.

Azerbaijan is one of the few countries with predominantly Muslim populations that shares a strategic alliance with Israel. Today, Israel is a major arms supplier to the country. ("See <a href="Azerbaijan%E2%80%93Israel%20relations">Azerbaijan–Israel relations</a>").

Azerbaijan also maintains good relations with the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, in the framework of its Eastern <a href="European%20Neighbourhood%20Policy">European Neighbourhood Policy</a> ("See <a href="Azerbaijan%20and%20the%20European%20Union">Azerbaijan and the European Union</a>").

Azerbaijan maintains diplomatic relations with <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120308154531/http%3A//mfa.gov.az/eng/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Btask%3Dview%26amp%3Bid%3D223%26amp%3BItemid%3D1">158</a> states (including <a href="State%20of%20Palestine">Palestine</a> and the Vatican City) and the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>. Azerbaijan has not yet established diplomatic relations with:

The frozen conflict over currently largely Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh within the <a href="Republic%20of%20Azerbaijan">Republic of Azerbaijan</a> began when in 1988 the Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh demanded autonomy with demonstrations and persecutions against ethnic Azeris following in Armenia. This led to <a href="Sumgait%20pogrom">anti-Armenian rioting</a> in Azerbaijan, with Azerbaijani militias beginning their effort to expel Armenians from the enclave. In 1992 a war broke out and <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s of Armenians and Azeris forced both groups to flee their homes. In 1994, a Russian-brokered ceasefire ended the war but more than 1 million ethnic Armenians and Azeris are still not able to return home. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved despite negotiations, that are ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">OSCE</a>, to resolve the conflict peacefully.

The <a href="European%20Stability%20Initiative">European Stability Initiative</a> (ESI) has revealed in a report from 2012 with the title "Caviar Diplomacy: How Azerbaijan silenced the Council of Europe", that since Azerbaijan's entry into the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>, each year 30 to 40 deputies are invited to Azerbaijan and generously paid with expensive gifts, including <a href="caviar">caviar</a> (worth up to 1.400 euro), silk carpets, gold, silver and large amounts of money. In return they become <a href="lobbyists">lobbyists</a> for Azerbaijan. This practice has been widely referred to as "Caviar diplomacy".

ESI also published a report on 2013 Presidential elections in Azerbaijan titled "Disgraced: Azerbaijan and the end of election monitoring as we know it". The report revealed the ties between Azerbaijani government and the members of certain observation missions who praised the elections. Azerbaijan's "Caviar diplomacy" at 2013 presidential elections sparked a major international scandal, as the reports of two authoritative organizations <a href="Parliamentary%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20Europe">Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe</a>/<a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> and <a href="Office%20for%20Democratic%20Institutions%20and%20Human%20Rights">OSCE/ODIHR</a> completely contradicted one another in their assessments of elections.

Non-governmental anti-corruption organization <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a> has regularly judged Azerbaijan to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world and has also criticized Azerbaijan for the "Caviar diplomacy".

At june 2016 the public prosecutor of Milan has accused the former leader of the (Christian) Union of the Center and of the European People's Party of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Luca Volonte of accepting large bribes from representatives of the Azerbaijani government. Two people with high-level experience of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly (Pace) have told the Guardian they believe its members have been offered bribes for votes by Azerbaijan. Former Azerbaijani diplomat, Arif Mammadov, alleged that a member of Azerbaijan's delegation at the Council of Europe had €30m (£25m) to spend on lobbying its institutions, including the Council of Europe assembly. PACE ratified the terms of reference of an independent external investigation body to carry out a detailed independent inquiry into the allegations of corruption at the council involving Azerbaijan.

On 6 March 2017, ESISC (European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center) published a scandalous report called “The Armenian Connection” where it veraciously attacked human rights NGOs and research organisations criticising human rights violations and corruption in Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Russia.

ESISC in that report asserted that "Caviar diplomacy" report elaborated by ESI aimed to create climate of suspicion based on slander to form a network of MPs that would engage in a political war against Azerbaijan. In the Second Chapter of the report called "The Armenian Connection: «Mr X», Nils Muižnieks, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights" that was published on 18 April 2017 ESISC asserted that the network composed of European PMs, Armenian officials and some NGOs: <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>, "Human Rights House Foundation", "Open Dialog, <a href="European%20Stability%20Initiative">European Stability Initiative</a>, and <a href="Helsinki%20Committee%20for%20Human%20Rights">Helsinki Committee for Human Rights</a> , was financed by the <a href="Soros%20Foundation">Soros Foundation</a>. According to ESISC the key figure of the network since 2012 has been <a href="Nils%20Mui%C5%BEnieks">Nils Muižnieks</a>, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe and the network has served to the interests of George Soros and the Republic of Armenia.

"The report is written in the worst traditions of authoritarian propaganda, makes absurd claims, and is clearly aimed at deflecting the wave of criticism against cover-up of unethical lobbying and corruption in PACE and demands for change in the Assembly", said Freedom Files Analytical Centre.

According Robert Coalson (Radio Free Europe), ESISC is a part of Baku's lobbying efforts to extend to the use of front think tanks to shift public opinion.

European Stability Initiative said that "ESISC report is full of lies (such as claiming that German PACE member Strasser holds pro-Armenian views and citing as evidence that he went to Yerevan in 2015 to commemorate the Armenian genocide, when Strasser has never in his life been to independent Armenia)".

Azerbaijani Armed Forces

The Azerbaijani Armed Forces () were re-established according to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Armed Forces from 9 October 1991. The <a href="Azerbaijan%20Democratic%20Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a> (ADR) had originally formed its own armed forces from 26 June 1918. However these were dissolved after Azerbaijan was absorbed into the Soviet Union as the <a href="Azerbaijan%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic</a> from 28 April 1920. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991–92 the armed forces were reformed based on Soviet bases and equipment left on Azeri soil.

The armed forces have three branches: the <a href="Azerbaijani%20Land%20Forces">Azerbaijani Land Forces</a>, the <a href="Azerbaijani%20Air%20and%20Air%20Defence%20Force">Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force</a>, and the <a href="Azerbaijani%20Navy">Azerbaijani Navy</a>. Associated forces include the <a href="Azerbaijani%20National%20Guard">Azerbaijani National Guard</a>, the <a href="Internal%20Troops%20of%20Azerbaijan">Internal Troops of Azerbaijan</a>, and the <a href="State%20Border%20Service%20%28Azerbaijan%29">State Border Service</a>, which can be involved in state defense under certain circumstances.

According to the Azerbaijani media sources the military expenditures of Azerbaijan for 2009 were set at $2.46 billion <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>, however according to <a href="Stockholm%20International%20Peace%20Research%20Institute">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a>, only $1.473 billion was spent in that year. <a href="IISS">IISS</a> also suggests that the defence budget in 2009 was $1.5 billion. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Industry%20of%20Azerbaijan">Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan</a> supervises the design, manufacturing, regulation and maintenance of military equipment. In the future, Azerbaijan hopes to start building tanks, armored vehicles, military planes and military helicopters.

The incumbent Minister of Defence of Azerbaijan is Colonel General <a href="Zakir%20Hasanov">Zakir Hasanov</a>, who succeeded <a href="Safar%20Abiyev">Safar Abiyev</a>.

Since the fall of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Azerbaijan has been undergoing extensive modernization and capacity expanding programs, with the military budget increasing from around $300 million in 2005 to $2.46 billion in 2009. The total armed forces number 56,840 men in the land forces, 7,900 men in the air force and air defence force, and 2,200 men in the navy. There are also 19,500 personnel in the National Guard, State Border Service, and Internal Troops. In addition, there are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last 15 years. The military hardware of Azerbaijan consists of 220 main battle tanks, an additional 162 T-80's were acquired between 2005 and 2010, 595 armored combat vehicles and 270 artillery systems. The air force has about 106 aircraft and 35 helicopters.

Azerbaijan has acceded to the <a href="Nuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> as a non-<a href="List%20of%20countries%20with%20nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons state</a>. Azerbaijan participates in <a href="NATO">NATO</a>'s <a href="Partnership%20for%20Peace">Partnership for Peace</a>. Azerbaijan joined the <a href="Multi-National%20Force%20%E2%80%93%20Iraq">multi-national force</a> in 2003. It sent 150 troops to Iraq, and later troops to Kosovo. Azeri troops are still serving in Afghanistan.

Despite the rise in Azerbaijan's defence budget, the armed forces were assessed in 2008 as not having a high state of battle readiness and being ill-prepared for wide scale combat operations.

However, in 2017 Global Firepower ranked Azerbaijan 59th among 127 countries for its military strength. It was the best performance among the countries of South Caucasus.

Today '<a href="National%20Hero%20of%20Azerbaijan">National Hero of Azerbaijan</a>' is the highest national title in the country, awarded for outstanding services of national importance to Azerbaijan in defense, as well as other deeds in other spheres.

The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to <a href="Azerbaijan%20Democratic%20Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a> in 1918, when the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan Republic were created on 26 June 1918. First "de facto" Minister of Defense of ADR was Dr. <a href="Khosrov%20bey%20Sultanov">Khosrov bey Sultanov</a>. When the Ministry was formally established Gen. <a href="Samedbey%20Mehmandarov">Samedbey Mehmandarov</a> became the minister, and then Lt-Gen. <a href="Ali-Agha%20Shikhlinski">Ali-Agha Shikhlinski</a> his deputy. Chiefs of Staff of ADR Army were Lt-Gen. <a href="Maciej%20Sulkiewicz">Maciej Sulkiewicz</a> (March 1919 – 10 December 1919) and Maj-Gen. Abdulhamid bey Gaitabashi (10 December 1919 – April 1920).

The <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> invaded Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in <a href="Karabakh">Karabakh</a>, the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 of the total 30,000 soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest. The national Army of Azerbaijan was abolished by the Bolshevik government, 15 of the 21 army generals were executed by the Bolsheviks.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union. Much of the Soviet Union's oil on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a> was supplied by Baku. By a decree of the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20USSR">Supreme Soviet of the USSR</a> in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was recognised with orders and medals.
<a href="Operation%20Edelweiss">Operation Edelweiss</a> carried out by the German <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> targeted <a href="Baku">Baku</a> because of the importance of its oil fields to the USSR.
Some 800,000 Azerbaijanis fought within the ranks of the Soviet Army of which 400,000 died. Azeri national formations of the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> included the <a href="223rd%20Rifle%20Division">223rd</a>, <a href="227th%20Rifle%20Division">227th</a>, <a href="396th%20Rifle%20Division">396th</a>, <a href="402nd%20Rifle%20Division">402nd</a>, and <a href="416th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">416th Rifle Division</a>s. Azeri Major-General <a href="Hazi%20Aslanov">Hazi Aslanov</a> was awarded a second <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a> after a long post-war fight for recognition of his accomplishments.

During the Cold War, Azerbaijan had been the deployment area of units of the Soviet <a href="4th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">4th Army</a> whose principle formations in 1988 included four motor rifle divisions (<a href="23rd%20Guards%20Motor%20Rifle%20Division">23rd Guards</a>, <a href="60th%20Motor%20Rifle%20Division">60th</a>, 75th, and <a href="295th%20Motor%20Rifle%20Division">295th</a>). The <a href="75th%20Motor%20Rifle%20Division">75th Motor Rifle Division</a> was isolated in <a href="Nakhchivan%20Autonomous%20Republic">Nakhichevan</a>. The 4th Army also included missile and air defense brigades and artillery and rocket regiments. The 75th Division's stores and equipment were apparently transferred to the Nakhichevan authorities. Azerbaijan also hosted the 49th Arsenal of the Soviet <a href="Main%20Agency%20of%20Missiles%20and%20Artillery%20of%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Defense%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery</a>, which contained over 7,000 train-car loads of ammunition to the excess of one billion units.

The first president of Azerbaijan, <a href="Ayaz%20Mutallibov">Ayaz Mutallibov</a>, did not wish to build an independent army, wanting to rely instead largely on Soviet troops. Even when the Parliament decided that an army should be formed in September 1991, disagreements between the government and the opposition <a href="Azerbaijani%20Popular%20Front%20Party">Azerbaijani Popular Front Party</a> impeded creation of a unified force. Around this time, the first unit of the new army was formed on the basis of the 18–110 military unit of <a href="mechanized%20infantry">mechanized infantry</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20Ground%20Forces">Soviet Ground Forces</a> (probably part of the <a href="4th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">4th Army</a>) located in <a href="Shikhov">Shikhov</a>, south of Baku. At the time of the parliamentary decision, Lieutenant-General <a href="Valeh%20Barshadli">Valeh Barshadli</a> became the first <a href="Minister%20of%20Defense%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Minister of Defense of Azerbaijan</a>, from 5 September to 11 December 1991. Later from May to 4 September 1992 he served as <a href="Chief%20of%20General%20Staff%20of%20Azerbaijani%20Armed%20Forces">Chief of General Staff of Azerbaijani Armed Forces</a>.

In summer 1992, the nascent Defense Ministry received a resolution by the Azerbaijani president on the takeover of units and formations in Azerbaijani territory. It then forwarded an ultimatum to Moscow demanding control over vehicles and armaments of the 135th and 139th Motor Rifle Regiments of the <a href="295th%20Motor%20Rifle%20Division">295th Motor Rifle Division</a>. In July 1992, Azerbaijan ratified the <a href="Treaty%20on%20Conventional%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20Europe">Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe</a> (CFE), which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment. Azerbaijan approved the CFE flank agreement in May 1997.

The transfer of the property of the 4th Army (except for part of the property of the 366th Motor Rifle Regiment of the <a href="23rd%20Guards%20Motor%20Rifle%20Division">23rd Guards Motor Rifle Division</a> captured by Armenian armed formations in 1992 during the regiment's withdrawal from Stepanakert) and the 49th arsenal was completed in 1992. Thus, by the end of 1992, Azerbaijan received arms and military hardware sufficient for approximately four motor rifle divisions with prescribed army units. It also inherited naval ships. There are also reports that 50 combat aircraft from the disbanded <a href="Baku%20Air%20Defence%20Army">19th Army</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Defence%20Forces">Soviet Air Defence Forces</a> came under Azeri control.
After Lt Gen Barshadli became Chief of General Staff, <a href="Minister%20of%20Defense%20%28Azerbaijan%29%23Ministers%20of%20Defense%20of%20Azerbaijan%20Republic">subsequent defense ministers from 1992</a> have included:


The Azeri armed forces took a series of devastating defeats by Armenian forces during the 1992–1994 <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">Nagorno-Karabakh War</a>, which resulted in the loss of control of Nagorno-Karabakh proper and seven surrounding <a href="rayon">rayon</a>s, comprising roughly 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani sources insist that Armenian victory was largely due to military help from Russia and the wealthy <a href="Armenian%20diaspora">Armenian diaspora</a>. Armenians partially deny the allegation, claiming that Russian side was equally supplying Armenian and Azerbaijani sides with weapons and mercenaries. During the war, the Azeri armed forces were also aided by Turkish military advisers, and Russian, Ukrainian, Chechen and Afghan mercenaries.

A number of Azerbaijani human rights groups have been tracking non-combat deaths and have noted an upward trend. Based on Defense Ministry statistics that had not been released to the public, the Group of Monitoring Compliance with Human Rights in the Army (GMCHRA) has recorded the deaths of 76 soldiers to date in non-combat incidents for 2011, and the injury of 91 others. In comparison, there were 62 non-combat deaths and 71 cases of injury in 2010. The string of non-combat deaths raises questions about the reform progress of the military. Factors behind the deaths include bullying, hazing, and the systemic corruption within the Azeri military.

The <a href="Azerbaijani%20Land%20Forces">Azerbaijani Land Forces</a> number 85,000 strong, according to UK <a href="Advanced%20Research%20and%20Assessment%20Group">Advanced Research and Assessment Group</a> estimates. The 2,500 men of the National Guard are also part of the ground forces. In addition, there are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last 15 years. Other paramilitary agencies consist of Interior Ministry <a href="Internal%20Troops%20of%20Azerbaijan">Internal Troops of Azerbaijan</a>, 12,000 strong, and the land component of the <a href="State%20Border%20Service%20%28Azerbaijan%29">State Border Service</a>, 5,000 strong.

Azerbaijan has signed numerous contracts to strengthen its armed forces and to train its military with Turkey's assistance. Over the last 15 years, Azerbaijan has been preparing its military for possible action against Armenian forces in <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>.

The Land Forces consist of five army corps:

The Land Forces include 23 motor rifle brigades, an artillery brigade, a multiple rocket launcher brigade, and an anti-tank regiment. The IISS Military Balance reported in 2007 that the Land Forces had an estimated 40 SA-13 Gopher, SA-4 Ganef, and SA-8 Gecko air defence missile systems, with '80–240 eff.' to support the army in the battlefield. (IISS 2007, p. 157)

The <a href="Peacekeeping%20forces%20of%20Azerbaijan">Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan</a> are mostly supplied from the Land Forces, though the <a href="Internal%20Troops%20of%20Azerbaijan">Internal Troops of Azerbaijan</a> do also supply some. As of March 2011, 94 peacekeepers were deployed with the <a href="International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">International Security Assistance Force</a> (ISAF) in Afghanistan. In the past, it also actively supported the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo and Iraq.

The Azeri <a href="Peacekeeping%20forces%20of%20Azerbaijan">peacekeeping unit</a> deployed in Iraq consisted of 14 officers, 16 sergeants and 120 privates, a total of 150 troops. The unit secured the <a href="hydroelectric%20power%20station">hydroelectric power station</a> and reservoir in <a href="Haditha%2C%20Iraq">Al Haditha</a> from August 2003. In December 2008, Azerbaijan withdrew the unit from Iraq.

Reportedly in December 2014 Azerbaijan created the 6th Army Corps in Nakhchivan. Karam Mustafayev became commander of the Special 6th Army Corps. The Special 6th Army Corps has been created based on the Nakhchivan 5th Army Corps to strengthen defense capability of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, increase of combat capability of military units and formations of the Armed Forces, improve central control, reports quoting the Defence Ministry said.

The <a href="Azerbaijani%20Air%20and%20Air%20Defence%20Force">Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force</a> is a single unified service branch. Some 8,000 men serve in the air force and air defence force.

The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has around 106 aircraft and 35 helicopters. The country has four major airbases. <a href="Nasosnaya%20%28air%20base%29">Nasosnaya (air base)</a> has fighters, <a href="Kyurdamir%20Air%20Base">Kyurdamir Air Base</a> a bomber regiment, <a href="Ganja%20Air%20Base">Ganja Air Base</a> transports, and <a href="Baku%20Kala%20Air%20Base">Baku Kala Air Base</a> the helicopter unit. There are also four other airbases which do not appear to have aircraft based there. These are <a href="Dollyar%20Air%20Base">Dollyar Air Base</a>, <a href="Nakhichevan%20Airport">Nakhichevan Airport</a>, <a href="Sanqacal">Sanqacal</a> Air Base, and <a href="Sitalcay">Sitalcay</a> Air Base.

The Azeri Air Force uses <a href="MiG-21">MiG-21</a>, <a href="MiG-23">MiG-23</a>, <a href="Su-24">Su-24</a> and <a href="Su-25">Su-25</a> aircraft, as well as the <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a> purchased from Ukraine in 2006 and <a href="Il-76">Il-76</a> transport aircraft. The MiG-29 have been designated as the standard aircraft for the AzAF. Azerbaijan is holding talks with either the People's Republic of China or Pakistan to purchase <a href="JF-17">JF-17</a> Thunder aircraft. <a href="MiG-25">MiG-25</a>s previously in service have been retired seemingly in the 2007–09 period.

Azerbaijan's helicopter force is concentrated at <a href="Baku%20Kala%20Air%20Base">Baku Kala Air Base</a> and according to the IISS consists of a single regiment with around 14–15 Mi-24, 12–13 Mi-8 and 7 Mi-2. <a href="Jane%27s%20Information%20Group">Jane's Information Group</a> and the IISS give figures which agree with only a single aircraft's difference. Recently, end of 2010 Russian Rosvertol announced that Azerbaijan armed forces signed a deal for 24 pieces of Mi-35M (Hind-E) gunships what would further enhance the Azeri ground attack formations.

The Air Force has <a href="Aero%20L-29%20Delf%C3%ADn">L-29</a> and <a href="Aero%20L-39%20Albatros">L-39</a> advanced training aircraft in store. The <a href="Azerbaijan%20Border%20Guard">Azerbaijan Border Guard</a> and Voluntary Society of Defense, Patriotism and Sport have <a href="Yakovlev">Yakovlev</a> light training aircraft.

Azerbaijan has missile and radar systems intended to defend Azeri airspace. There are at least 2 divisions of <a href="S-300%20%28missile%29">S-300</a>PMU2. Thereby the country has one of the most capable SAM <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a> system in the region. Azerbaijan also operates two S-200 (SA-5 GAMMON) batteries near Baku and Mingachevir; the S-300PMU-2 represents a logical replacement for these systems offering coverage of the majority of the nation. The country also has about 100 NATO designated <a href="SA-2">SA-2</a> Guideline (original name S-75), <a href="SA-3%20Goa">SA-3 Goa</a> (S-125 Pechora-2M), and the <a href="S-200%20Angara/Vega/Dubna">SA-5 Gammon</a> (S-200) are in static installations. These may be around Baku and the central part to cover the whole Azeri aerospace.

However, August 2011 investigations shows that after purchase of <a href="S-300%20%28missile%29">S-300</a> <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a>s, the largest apparent gap in Azerbaijan's air defense system may have been filled.

Also in Azerbaijan there was a former Soviet early warning radar. The <a href="Gabala%20Radar%20Station">Gabala Radar Station</a> was a bistatic phased-array installation, operated by the <a href="Russian%20Space%20Forces">Russian Space Forces</a>. The contract was signed in 2002 and was due to expire in 2012 where it was to be given back to the Azerbaijani government. The contract costed Russia $7 million per year. The radar station had a range of up to , and was designed to detect <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a> launches as far as from the Indian Ocean. In December 2012 Russia announced that negotiations had been unsuccessful and that they had stopped using the radar station. The site was given back to <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and all the equipment dismantled and transported to <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. Nowadays, Russia covers the area from the <a href="Armavir%20Radar%20Station">Armavir Radar Station</a>.

Azerbaijani pilots are trained in the Azerbaijan Air Force School and then developing their skills in operational units. Azerbaijan has an experience exchange with Turkey, Ukraine, the United States and a number of NATO countries. The Turkish Air Force School has a great role in the training of Azeri military pilots. Azerbaijani pilots are also trained in Ukraine's Pilot Training School.

The main naval base of the Soviet Union in the Caspian Sea was based in Baku. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Azerbaijan inherited the naval base and parts of the Caspian Fleet. The <a href="Azerbaijan%20Navy">Azerbaijan Navy</a> has about 2,200 personnel. The navy has a <a href="Petya-class%20frigate">Petya class</a> light frigate, "Qusar" (G 121), and a number of <a href="patrol%20craft">patrol craft</a>, including one Turk class, "Araz," P 223, one Brya (Project 722) class, P 218, one Shelon (Project 1388M) class, P 212, one Poluchat class (Project 368), P 219, one Luga class (Project 888), T 710, and four Petrushka (Polish UK-3 class), P 213, P 214, P 215, and P 216. There are four <a href="minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweeper</a>s consisting of 2 <a href="Sonya%20class%20minesweeper">Sonya class minesweeper</a> and 2 <a href="Yevgenya%20class%20minesweeper">Yevgenya class minesweeper</a>s. (Jane's Fighting Ships 2010)

The Navy is also attributed with 5 <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a>, 3 Polnochny and 2 Vydra,(IISS 2007) plus three research ships, 1 Project 10470, A 671, ex Svyaga, 1 Balerian Uryvayev class survey vessel (AG) and one Vadim Popov class survey vessel (AG).

The U.S. Navy has helped train the Azeri Navy. There is also an agreement to provide US support to refurbish Azeri warships in the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. In 2006, the US Government donated 3 motorboats to the Azerbaijani navy. In 2007 an agreement between Azeri Navy and a US military company was concluded, which stated that a part of the Azeri Navy would be equipped with advanced laser marksmanship systems. The US company specialists were also to give training on the use of the new equipment. A number of separate U.S. programmes are underway under the <a href="Caspian%20Guard%20Initiative">Caspian Guard Initiative</a>, focused mostly on enhancing Azerbaijani and Kazakh maritime border security.

In May 2011, President of the <a href="State%20Oil%20Company%20of%20Azerbaijan%20Republic">State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic</a> <a href="Rovnag%20Abdullayev">Rovnag Abdullayev</a> stated that Azerbaijan to start production of national warships after 2013.

The Naval Intelligence of Azerbaijan maintains the 641st Special Warfare Naval Unit. The special forces were trained by the <a href="Navy%20Seals">Navy Seals</a> of the U.S. and both special forces have participated in joint naval exercises, headquartered at the Azerbaijani Naval Station on the island of Wolf in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Baku">Bay of Baku</a>. Unit 641 has several <a href="midget%20submarine">midget submarine</a>s such as Triton-1M and Triton 2 at their disposal as well as underwater tool motion for individual divers. The special unit is composed of 3 reconnaissance groups, 2 groups for mountainous warfare and one diving group. Obligatory training includes parachute jumping day and night, on land and on water.

There is also unconfirmed reports of a 'Tigers' special warfare unit. It is said that the 'Tigers' unit was established in cooperation with the <a href="Turkish%20Navy">Turkish Navy</a> in 2001. The training and structure of the Tigers are similar to Turkish special forces, <a href="Su%20Alt%C4%B1%20Taarruz">Su Altı Taarruz</a> and United States Special Forces who have close training relationships with them. The first Tiger units were established at <a href="Ganja%2C%20Azerbaijan">Ganja</a> following a joint training program with Turkey. The Special Forces are equipped with the Israeli <a href="IMI%20Tavor%20TAR-21">IMI Tavor TAR-21</a>.

The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Industry%20of%20Azerbaijan">Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan</a> directs domestic military supplies for Azerbaijan. It was established in 2005. The Defence Industries Ministry subsumed the State Department for Military Industry and for Armaments and the Military Science Center, each of which was formerly a separate agency within the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry.

The defense industry has emerged as an autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability. The ministry is cooperating with the defense sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan. Along with other contracts, Azerbaijani defence industries and Turkish companies, Azerbaijan will produce 40mm revolver grenade launchers, 107mm and 122mm MLRS systems, Cobra 4×4 vehicles and joint modernization of BTR vehicles in Baku.

The major military companies of Azerbaijan are:

In early 2008, reports indicated that an agreement with Turkey had been signed which would lead to Azerbaijan producing armoured personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and small calibre artillery pieces. Another 2008 report mentioned Azerbaijan's desire to produce its own military aircraft and helicopters, but quoted a military expert as saying that it would be impossible to do so for the next five years.

Azerbaijan cooperates with about 60 countries in the military-technical sphere and has an agreement on military-technical cooperation with more than 30 countries.

In December 2009 an agreement on military assistance was signed by Turkey and Azerbaijan. The agreement envisions <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>'s supplying Azerbaijan with weapons, military equipment and, if necessary, soldiers in case war with Armenia over Karabakh resumes.

Turkey has provided Azerbaijan with infantry weapons, tactical vehicles (jeeps, trucks, etc.) professional training, military organization, technology transfer, licensed military hardware production and other services. Due to help from Turkish specialists and instructors, thousands of Azerbaijani officers have been trained to western standards.

The military position as international importance of Azerbaijan increased with agreement between Azerbaijan and Turkey on the participation an Azerbaijani peacekeeping platoon in the staff of Turkish battalion in Kosovo.

Since 1992 Azerbaijan and Turkey have signed more than 100 military protocols, some of the major protocols include:

In May 2011, Azerbaijan had discussed the purchase of long-range rockets from two Chinese companies, the minister of the defence industry has said. Other arms deals were signed with Turkey. Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and Yaver Jamalov signed a protocol of intent on future joint production of two types of output – 107-mm rockets and the national rifle, possibly the Mehmetçik-1. A protocol of intent was signed the same day with the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation <a href="MKEK">MKEK</a> on the joint production of 120-mm mortar launchers. This project will come into force in a few months time. Agreement has also been reached with Turkish company Aselsan on the production of some types of defence output in Azerbaijan, specifically the latest types of weapons' sights. These projects will probably happen in the near future too. Recently, Turkish defense industries secretariat told that an export version of the T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitser is almost done and could start production. T-155 has been powered by a German MTU power pack, which restricts the sale to some countries like Azerbaijan. The Turkish manufacturer MKEK, has announced that they have found an alternate supplier for the power pack where Azerbaijan showed interest to buy the high tech, more capable 155mm 52 caliber from Turkish authorities.

<a href="Section%20907">Section 907</a> of the United States <a href="Freedom%20Support%20Act">Freedom Support Act</a> bans any kind of direct United States <a href="aid">aid</a> to the Azerbaijani government. Since a waiver was made in 2001 there has been extensive U.S. military cooperation with Azerbaijan. This has included Special Forces and naval aid, consultations with <a href="United%20States%20European%20Command">United States European Command</a>, and linkages through the U.S. National Guard <a href="State%20Partnership%20Program">State Partnership Program</a>.

On 19 May 2006, Azerbaijani Defense Minister <a href="Safar%20Abiyev">Safar Abiyev</a> and the then commander of <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Forces%20in%20Europe">United States Air Forces in Europe</a> General <a href="Tom%20Hobbins">Tom Hobbins</a> met in <a href="Baku">Baku</a> to discuss military cooperation. He said the objective of his visit was to become familiar with the state of Azerbaijani armed forces. Hobbins pointed to the progress made in the NATO-Azerbaijan relations, saying that the successful implementation of the NATO <a href="Partnership%20for%20Peace">Partnership for Peace</a> program in Azerbaijan has brought the country even closer to the alliance. He said that the two countries' air forces will expand cooperation.

The U.S. state of <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> is linked with Azerbaijan through the <a href="U.S.%20National%20Guard">U.S. National Guard</a> <a href="State%20Partnership%20Program">State Partnership Program</a> (SPP). <a href="Oklahoma%20National%20Guard">Oklahoma National Guard</a> troops have been sent on training and humanitarian missions to Baku.

Russia is Azerbaijan's main arms supplier. "As of today, military and technical cooperation with Russia is measured at $4 billion and it tends to grow further," President Ilham Aliyev said today after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Baku, the Azeri capital in 2013.

Azerbaijan and Israel cooperate on numerous areas of the defense industry. Azerbaijan has shown great interest in Israeli technology over the years. In particular, an agreement was reached over the construction of the factory of intelligence and combat drones in Azerbaijan.

The Israeli defense company <a href="Elta">Elta</a> Systems Ltd has had cooperation from Azerbaijan in building the <a href="TecSAR">TecSAR</a> reconnaissance satellite system, which can take high-definition photos of ground surfaces in all weather conditions. According to Azerbaijani military experts, the TecSAR system will be indispensable for military operations in the mountainous terrains of Azerbaijan.

As of June 2009, Israel and Azerbaijan had been negotiating on the production of <a href="Namer%20%28vehicle%29">Namer</a> armoured <a href="infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">infantry fighting vehicle</a>s in Azerbaijan. There is no further information as to whether any agreement has been made.

Both countries treat a nuclear <a href="I.R.%20Iran">I.R. Iran</a> as security threat.

The <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) and Azerbaijan actively cooperate on defence institutional reforms and have developed practical cooperation in many other areas. Azerbaijan's <a href="Individual%20Partnership%20Action%20Plan">Individual Partnership Action Plan</a> (IPAP) and its <a href="Partnership%20for%20Peace">Partnership for Peace</a> (PfP) linkages lay out the programme of cooperation between Azerbaijan and NATO.

The Azerbaijani government has however delayed implementing IPAP-recommended reforms, however, in part at least because no decision had been taken to seek NATO membership. This is because Azerbaijan's foreign policy 'seeks to balance interests with the U.S., EU, Russia and Iran.'

According to a NATO diplomatic source some key officials at NATO headquarters in <a href="Brussel">Brussel</a>s were pushing hard for engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. "Turkey, Romania, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a>," are among the member-states also backing a fast track for Azerbaijan's NATO membership.

However, Azerbaijan made its policy of <a href="non-belligerent">not being aligned</a> with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a> in 2011.

There is also a limited amount of military cooperation with the other countries of <a href="GUAM">GUAM</a>: Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova.

Geography of Armenia

<a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> is a landlocked country in the <a href="Transcaucasia">Transcaucasia</a> region, between the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black</a> and <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>s, bordered on the north and east by <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and on the south and west by <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>.

The terrain is mostly mountainous and flat, with fast flowing rivers and few forests but with many trees. The climate is highland continental: hot summers and cold winters. The land rises to 4,095 m above sea-level at <a href="Mount%20Aragats">Mount Aragats</a>.

Pollution from toxic chemicals such as <a href="DDT">DDT</a> is not helping the already poor soil quality in many parts of the country.

Armenia is trying to address its environmental problems. It has established a Ministry of Nature Protection and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid waste disposal, whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities. Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, a group of 12 former Soviet republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues. The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant as soon as alternative energy sources are identified.

<a href="Geographic%20coordinates">Geographic coordinates</a>: 

Armenia is located in southern Transcaucasia, the region southwest of <a href="Russia">Russia</a> between the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. Modern Armenia term means <a href="Republic%20of%20Armenia">Republic of Armenia</a> which occupies part of historical Armenia, whose ancient centres were in the valley of the <a href="Araks%20River">Araks River</a> and the region around <a href="Lake%20Van">Lake Van</a> in Turkey. Armenia is bordered on the north by Georgia, on the east by <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, on the southwest by the <a href="Nagorno-Karabagh">Nagorno-Karabagh</a>, on the south by Iran, and on the west by Turkey.

Twenty-five million years ago, a geological upheaval pushed up the Earth's crust to form the Armenian Plateau, creating the complex topography of modern Armenia. The Lesser Caucasus range extends through northern Armenia, runs southeast between <a href="Lake%20Sevan">Lake Sevan</a> and Azerbaijan, then passes roughly along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border to Iran. Thus situated, the mountains make travel from north to south difficult. Geological turmoil continues in the form of devastating earthquakes, which have plagued Armenia. In December 1988, the second largest city in the republic, Leninakan (now <a href="Gyumri">Gyumri</a>), was heavily damaged by a massive quake that killed more than 25,000 people.

About half of Armenia's area of approximately has an elevation of at least , and only 3% of the country lies below . The lowest points are in the valleys of the Araks River and the Debet River in the far north, which have elevations of , respectively. Elevations in the Lesser Caucasus vary between . To the southwest of the range is the Armenian Plateau, which slopes southwestward toward the Araks River on the Turkish border. The plateau is masked by intermediate mountain ranges and extinct volcanoes. The largest of these, <a href="Mount%20Aragats">Mount Aragats</a>, high, is also the highest point in Armenia. Most of the population lives in the western and northwestern parts of the country, where the two major cities, <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> and Gyumri (which was called Aleksandropol' during the tsarist period), are located.

The valleys of the Debet and Akstafa rivers form the chief routes into Armenia from the north as they pass through the mountains. Lake Sevan, across at its widest point and long, is by far the largest lake. It lies above sea level on the plateau. Terrain is most rugged in the extreme southeast, which is drained by the Bargushat River, and most moderate in the Araks River valley to the extreme southwest. Most of Armenia is drained by the <a href="Araks">Araks</a> or its tributary, the <a href="Hrazdan">Hrazdan</a>, which flows from Lake Sevan. The Araks forms most of Armenia's border with Turkey and Iran while the <a href="Zangezur%20Mountains">Zangezur Mountains</a> form the border between Armenia's southern <a href="Syunik%20Province">province of Syunik</a> and Azerbaijan's adjacent Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.
Temperatures in Armenia generally depend upon elevation. Mountain formations block the moderating climatic influences of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, creating wide seasonal variations with cold snowy winters, and warm to hot summers. On the Armenian Plateau, the mean midwinter temperature is to , and the mean midsummer temperature is to . Average precipitation ranges from per year in the lower Araks River valley to at the highest altitudes. Despite the harshness of winter in most parts (with frosts reaching and lower in <a href="Shirak%20Province">Shirak</a> region), the fertility of the plateau's volcanic soil made Armenia one of the world's earliest sites of agricultural activity.

A broad public discussion of environmental problems began in the mid-1980s, when the first "green" groups formed in opposition to Yerevan's intense industrial air pollution and to nuclear power generation in the wake of the 1986 reactor explosion at Chernobyl'. Environmental issues helped form the basis of the nationalist independence movement when environmental demonstrations subsequently merged with those for other political causes in the late 1980s.
republics as they emerge from the centralized planning system's disastrous approach to resource management. By 1980 the infrequency of sightings of Mount Ararat, which looms about sixty kilometers across the closed Turkish border, became a symbol of worsening air pollution in Yerevan.

The <a href="Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church">Armenian Apostolic Church</a> can trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries. The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D. Over 90% of Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the Coptic and Syrian churches. Armenia also has a population of <a href="Armenian%20Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a> and evangelical Protestants.

The country's population has declined due to increased <a href="emigration">emigration</a> since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have decreased in recent years, and there has been a moderate influx of Armenians returning to Armenia.

Politics of Armenia

The politics of Armenia takes place in a framework of a <a href="Semi-presidential%20system">semi-presidential</a> <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democratic</a> republic, whereby the President is the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and the Prime Minister is the <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>, and of a multi-party system. <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the government. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the government and parliament.

Armenia became independent from the <a href="Transcaucasian%20Democratic%20Federative%20Republic">Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic</a> on 28 May 1918 as the <a href="First%20Republic%20of%20Armenia">First Republic of Armenia</a>. After the First Republic collapsed on 2 December 1920, it was absorbed into the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and became part of the <a href="Transcaucasian%20SFSR">Transcaucasian SFSR</a>. The TSFSR dissolved in 1936 and Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union known as the <a href="Armenian%20SSR">Armenian SSR</a>.

The population of <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> voted overwhelmingly for independence in a September 1991 referendum, followed by a presidential election in October 1991 that gave 83% of the vote to <a href="Levon%20Ter-Petrosyan">Levon Ter-Petrosyan</a>. Ter-Petrosyan had been elected head of government in 1990, when the <a href="National%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Armenia">National Democratic Union party</a> defeated the Armenian Communist Party. Ter-Petrosyan was re-elected in 1996. Following public demonstrations against Ter-Petrosyan's policies on <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20Republic">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, the President resigned in January 1998 and was replaced by Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Kocharyan">Robert Kocharyan</a>, who was elected President in March 1998. Following the <a href="1999%20Armenian%20parliament%20shooting">assassination in Parliament</a> of Prime Minister <a href="Vazgen%20Sargsyan">Vazgen Sargsyan</a> and parliament Speaker <a href="Karen%20Demirchyan">Karen Demirchyan</a> and six other officials, on 27 October 1999, a period of political instability ensued during which an opposition headed by elements of the former Armenian National Movement government attempted unsuccessfully to force Kocharyan to resign. Kocharyan was successful in riding out the unrest. In May 2000, <a href="Andranik%20Margaryan">Andranik Margaryan</a> replaced <a href="Aram%20Sargsyan">Aram Sargsyan</a> as Prime Minister.

Kocharyan's re-election as president in 2003 was followed by widespread allegations of ballot-rigging. He went on to propose controversial constitutional amendments on the role of parliament. These were rejected in a referendum the following May at the same time as parliamentary elections which left Kocharyan's party in a very powerful position in parliament. There were mounting calls for the President's resignation in early 2004 with thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.

The unicameral parliament (also called the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Armenia">National Assembly</a>) is dominated by a coalition, called "Unity" (Miasnutyun), between the <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Armenia">Republican</a> and <a href="People%27s%20Party%20of%20Armenia">Peoples</a> Parties and the Agro-Technical Peoples Union, aided by numerous independents. <a href="Armenian%20Revolutionary%20Federation">Dashnaksutyun</a>, which was outlawed by Ter-Petrosyan in 1995–96 but legalized again after Ter-Petrosyan resigned, also usually supports the government. A new party, the <a href="Republic%20%28Armenia%29">Republic Party</a>, is headed by ex-Prime Minister <a href="Aram%20Sargsyan">Aram Sargsyan</a>, brother of <a href="Vazgen%20Sargsyan">Vazgen Sargsyan</a>, and has become the primary voice of the opposition, which also includes the <a href="Armenian%20Communist%20Party">Armenian Communist Party</a>, the <a href="National%20Unity%20%28Armenia%29">National Unity party</a> of <a href="Artashes%20Geghamyan">Artashes Geghamyan</a>, and elements of the former Ter-Petrosyan government.

The Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a Western-style <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a> as the basis of its <a href="form%20of%20government">form of government</a>. However, international observers have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum since 1995, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28Armenia%29">Electoral Commission</a>, and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. For the most part however, Armenia is considered one of the more pro-democratic nations in the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>. Observers noted, though, that opposition parties and candidates have been able to mount credible campaigns and proper polling procedures have been generally followed. Elections since 1998 have represented an improvement in terms of both fairness and efficiency, although they are still considered to have fallen short of international standards. The new constitution of 1995 greatly expanded the powers of the executive branch and gives it much more influence over the judiciary and municipal officials.

The observance of human rights in Armenia is uneven and is marked by shortcomings. <a href="Police%20brutality">Police brutality</a> allegedly still goes largely unreported, while observers note that defendants are often beaten to extract confessions and are denied visits from relatives and lawyers. Public demonstrations usually take place without government interference, though one rally in November 2000 by an opposition party was followed by the arrest and imprisonment for a month of its organizer. Freedom of religion is not always protected under existing law. Nontraditional churches, especially the <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, have been subjected to harassment, sometimes violently. All churches apart from the <a href="Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church">Armenian Apostolic Church</a> must register with the government, and proselytizing was forbidden by law, though since 1997 the government has pursued more moderate policies. The government's policy toward conscientious objection is in transition, as part of Armenia's accession to the Council of Europe. Most of Armenia's ethnic <a href="Azeri">Azeri</a> population was deported in 1988–1989 and remain refugees, largely in Azerbaijan. Armenia's record on discrimination toward the few remaining <a href="national%20minorities">national minorities</a> is generally good. The government does not restrict internal or international travel. Although freedom of the press and speech are guaranteed, the government maintains its monopoly over television and radio broadcasting.

In December 2015 the country <a href="Armenian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202015">held a referendum</a> which resulted in Armenia changing its form of government from a presidential to a parliamentary republic.

As a result, the president was stripped of his previous <a href="Veto%23presidential%20veto">veto faculty</a> and the presidency downgraded to a figurehead position elected by parliament every seven years. Following the reform, the president can not be a member of any political party and <a href="re-election">re-election</a> is now forbidden. The amendments also reduced the number of parliamentary seats from 131 to 101.

Sceptics saw the constitutional reform as a way for incumbent President <a href="Serzh%20Sargsyan">Serzh Sargsyan</a> to remain in control by becoming prime minister when his second presidential term ends in 2018.

The president is elected for a five-year term by the people (absolute majority with 2nd round if necessary).

The <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Armenia%29">National Assembly of Armenia</a> ("Azgayin Zhoghov") is the <a href="legislative%20branch">legislative branch</a> of the government of <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>. It is a <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> body, initially made of 131 members, elected for five-year terms: 90 members in single-seat constituencies and 41 by proportional representation. The proportional-representation seats in the National Assembly are assigned on a party-list basis amongst those parties that receive at least 5% of the total of the number of the votes.
Following the 2015 referendum, the number of MPs was reduced from the original 131 members to 101.

The <a href="electoral%20threshold">electoral threshold</a> is currently set at 5% for single parties and 7% for blocs.

The first <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a> in Armenia was held by the <a href="Armenian%20Revolutionary%20Federation">Armenian Revolutionary Federation</a> in November 2007 to select the presidential candidate. Some 300.000 people voted.

Independent of three traditional branches are the following <a href="independent%20agencies">independent agencies</a>, each with separate powers and responsibilities:


Political corruption is a problem in Armenian society. In 2008, <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a> reduced its <a href="Corruption%20Perceptions%20Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a> for Armenia from 3.0 in 2007 to 2.9 out of 10 (a lower score means more perceived corruption); Armenia slipped from 99th place in 2007 to 109th out of 180 countries surveyed (on a par with <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, Belize, <a href="Moldova">Moldova</a>, Solomon Islands, and <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a>). Despite legislative revisions in relation to elections and party financing, corruption either persists or has re-emerged in new forms.

The <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> in Armenia views corruption in Armenia as "a serious challenge to its development."

Economy of Armenia

The economy of <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> is ranked <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29">132nd</a> in the world, with a nominal <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP) of $10.561 billion per annum. It is also the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29">129th</a> largest in the world by <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a> (PPP), at $25.329 billion per annum. Armenia is the second-most densely populated of the <a href="post-Soviet%20states">post-Soviet states</a> because of its small size. It is situated between the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, bordered on the north and east by <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and on the south and west by <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>.

Until independence, Armenia's economy was based largely on <a href="industry">industry</a>—<a href="Chemical%20substance">chemicals</a>, <a href="electronics">electronic products</a>, <a href="machinery">machinery</a>, <a href="processed%20food">processed food</a>, <a href="synthetic%20rubber">synthetic rubber</a> and <a href="textiles">textiles</a>; it was highly dependent on outside resources. <a href="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Armenian mines produce <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a> and <a href="lead">lead</a>. The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel, including gas and nuclear fuel from Russia (for its one nuclear power plant.) The main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.

Like other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally <a href="planned%20economy">planned economy</a> and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the <a href="1988%20Spitak%20earthquake">1988 earthquake</a>, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> over <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable. In 1992-93, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the <a href="Armenian%20dram">dram</a>, suffered <a href="hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.

Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily <a href="Armenia%20Telephone%20Company">Armentel</a>, which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors). This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF), <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>, EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed <a href="USD">$</a>800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the <a href="earthquake%20zone">earthquake zone</a>.

Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and accelerating privatization. A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization. The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization. By 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005. Armenia joined the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at <a href="Metsamor">Metsamor</a>. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was <a href="privatized">privatized</a> in 2002. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, <a href="remittances">remittances</a> from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector. The government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement.

Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its <a href="mineral">mineral</a> deposits (<a href="gold">gold</a> and <a href="bauxite">bauxite</a>) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed <a href="economic%20system">economic system</a> of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-99. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic restructuring and foreign direct investment.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the territory of present-day Armenia was a backward agricultural region with some <a href="copper">copper</a> mining and <a href="cognac">cognac</a> production. From 1914 through 1921, Caucasian Armenia suffered from war, revolution, the influx of refugees from Turkish Armenia, disease, hunger and economic misery. About 200,000 people died in 1919 alone. At that point, only American relief efforts saved Armenia from total collapse.

The first Soviet Armenian government regulated economic activity stringently, nationalising all economic enterprises, requisitioning <a href="grain">grain</a> from peasants, and suppressing most private market activity. This first experiment of state control ended with the advent of Soviet leader <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>'s <a href="New%20Economic%20Policy">New Economic Policy</a> (NEP) of 1921–27. This policy continued state control of the large enterprises and banks, but peasants could market much of their grain, and small businesses could function. In Armenia, the NEP years brought partial recovery from the economic disaster of the post-World War I period. By 1926 agricultural production in Armenia had reached nearly three-quarters of its prewar level.

By the end of the 1920s, Stalin's regime had revoked the NEP and reestablished the state monopoly on all economic activity. Once this occurred, the main goal of the Soviet economic policy in Armenia was to turn a predominantly agrarian and rural republic into an industrial and urban one. Among other restrictions, peasants now were forced to sell nearly all of their output to state procurement agencies rather than at the market. From the 1930s through the 1960s, an industrial infrastructure has been constructed. Besides hydroelectric plants and canals, roads were built and gas pipelines were laid to bring fuel and food from Azerbaijan and Russia.

The Stalinist command economy, in which market forces were suppressed and all orders for production and distribution came from the state authorities, survived in all its essential features until the fall of the Soviet regime in 1991. In the early stages of the communist economic revolution, Armenia underwent a fundamental transformation into a "proletarian" society. Between 1929 and 1939, the percentage of Armenia's work force categorised as industrial workers grew from 13% to 31%. By 1935 industry supplied 62% of Armenia's economic production. Highly integrated and sheltered within artificial barter economy of the Soviet system from the 1930s until the end of the communist era, the Armenian economy showed few signs of self-sufficiency at any time during that period. In 1988 Armenia produced only 0.9% of the <a href="net%20material%20product">net material product</a> of the Soviet Union (1.2% of industry, 0.7% of agriculture). The republic retained 1.4% of total state budget revenue, delivered 63.7% of its NMP to other republics, and exported only 1.4% of what it produced to markets outside the Soviet Union.

Armenia's industry was especially dependent on the Soviet military-industrial complex. About 40% of all enterprises in the republic were devoted to defense, and some factories lost 60% to 80% of their business in the last years of the Soviet Union, when massive cuts were made in the national defense expenditures. As the republic's economy faced the prospects of competing in world markets in the mid 1990s, the great liabilities of Armenia's industry were its outdated equipment and infrastructure and the pollution emitted by many of the country's heavy industrial plants.

In 1991, Armenia's last year as a Soviet republic, national income fell 12% from the previous year, while per capita gross national product was 4,920 rubles, only 68% of the Soviet average. In large part due to the earthquake of 1988, the Azerbaijani blockade that began in 1989 and the collapse of the international trading system of the Soviet Union, the Armenian economy of the early 1990s remained far below its 1980 production levels. In the first years of independence (1992–93), inflation was extremely high, productivity and national income dropped dramatically, and the national budget ran large deficits.

Armenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s, when <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachov">Mikhail Gorbachov</a> began advocating economic reform. Cooperatives were set up in the service sector, particularly in restaurants, although substantial resistance came from the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Armenia%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Communist Party of Armenia</a> (CPA) and other groups that had enjoyed privileged position in the old economy. In the late 1980s, much of Armenia's economy already was opening either semi-officially or illegally, with widespread <a href="corruption">corruption</a> and <a href="bribery">bribery</a>. The so-called mafia, made up of interconnected groups of powerful officials and their relatives and friends, sabotaged the efforts of reformers to create a lawful market system. When the December 1988 earthquake brought millions of dollars of foreign aid to the devastated regions of Armenia, much of the money went to corrupt and criminal elements.

Beginning in 1991, the democratically elected government pushed vigorously for privatisation and market relations, although its efforts were frustrated by the old ways of doing business in Armenia, the Azerbaijani blockade, and the costs of the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">Nagorno-Karabakh War</a>. In 1992, the Law on the Programme of Privatisation and Decentralisation of Incompletely Constructed Facilities established a state privatisation committee, with members from all political parties. In middle 1993, the committee announced a two-year privatisation programme, whose first stage would be privatisation of 30% of state enterprises, mostly services and light industries. The remaining 70%, including many bankrupt, nonfunctional enterprises, were to be privatised in a later stage with a minimum of government restriction, to encourage private initiative. For all enterprises, the workers would receive 20% of their firm's property free of charge; 30% would be distributed to all citizens by means of vouchers; and the remaining 50% was to be distributed by the government, with preference given to members of the labour organisations. A major problem of this system, however, was the lack of supporting legislation covering foreign investment protection, bankruptcy, monopoly policy, and consumer protection.

In the first post-communist years, efforts to interest foreign investors in joint enterprises were only moderately successful because of the blockade and the energy shortage. Only in late 1993 was a department of foreign investment established in the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Economy%20%28Armenia%29">Ministry of Economy</a>, to spread information about Armenia's investment opportunities and improve the legal infrastructure for investment activity. A specific goal of this agency was creating a market for scientific and technical intellectual property.

A few Armenians living abroad made large-scale investments. Besides a toy factory and construction projects, diaspora Armenians built a cold storage plant (which in its first years had little produce to store) and established the <a href="American%20University%20of%20Armenia">American University of Armenia</a> in Yerevan to teach the techniques necessary to run a market economy.

Armenia was admitted to the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> in May 1992 and to the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> in September. A year later, the government complained that those organisations were holding back financial assistance and announced its intention to move toward fuller price liberalisation, and the removal of all <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s, quotas, and restrictions of foreign trade. Although privatisation had slowed because of catastrophic collapse of the economy, Prime Minister <a href="Hrant%20Bagratyan">Hrant Bagratyan</a> informed the United States officials in the fall of 1993 that plans had been made to embark on a renewed privatisation programme by the end of the year.

The Armenian economy's competitiveness is low and stagnating according to the <a href="Global%20Competitiveness%20Index">Global Competitiveness Index</a>, in which Armenia's ranking slipped from 80th out of 132 countries in 2006-2007 index to 93rd out of 131 countries in the 2007-2008 index (just below <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> and Pakistan). Armenia ranks 82nd out of 144 economies according to the 2012-2013 <a href="Global%20Competitiveness%20Index">Global Competitiveness Index</a>.

Armenia ranks 39th out of 179 economies according to the 2012 <a href="Index%20of%20Economic%20Freedom">Index of Economic Freedom</a>. Armenia is ranked 19th freest among the 43 countries in the Europe region, putting it above the world and regional averages.

Armenia ranks 32nd out of 185 economies according to the 2013 <a href="ease%20of%20doing%20business%20index">ease of doing business index</a>.

Armenia's economy is competitive to a few extent with government-connected individuals enjoying de facto monopolies over the import and distribution of basic commodities and foodstuffs, and under-reporting revenue to avoid paying taxes.

Despite pronouncements at the highest levels of government on the importance of free competition, Armenia is next to last in the effectiveness of its anti-monopoly policy according to the 2010 results of the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.

According to <a href="Vahram%20Nercissiantz">Vahram Nercissiantz</a>, President <a href="Serzh%20Sargsyan">Serzh Sargsyan</a>'s chief economic adviser, "Businessmen holding state positions have turned into oligarchs who have avoided paying sufficient taxes by abusing their state positions, distorted markets with unequal conditions, breached the rules of competition, impeded or prevented small and medium-sized business’ entry into manufacturing and thereby sharply deepened social polarization in the republic.

Following the advice of economic advisors who cautioned Armenia's leadership against the consolidation of economic power in the hands of a few, in January 2001, the Government of Armenia established the <a href="http%3A//www.competition.am/%3Flng%3D2">State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition</a>. Its members cannot be dismissed by the government.

According to one analyst, Armenia's economic system is <a href="anticompetitive">anticompetitive</a> due to the structure of the economy being a type of "<a href="monopoly">monopoly</a> or <a href="oligopoly">oligopoly</a>". "The result is the prices with us do not drop even if they do on international market, or they do quite belated and not to the size of the international market."

According to the estimate of a former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Armenia">prime minister</a>, <a href="Hrant%20Bagratian">Hrant Bagratian</a>, 55 percent of Armenia's <a href="GDP">GDP</a> is controlled by 44 families.

In early 2008, the State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition named 60 companies having "dominant positions" in Armenia.

In October 2009, when visiting <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a>, the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>’s managing director, <a href="Ngozi%20Okonjo-Iweala">Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala</a>, warned that Armenia will not reach a higher level of development unless its leadership changes the "oligopolistic" structure of the national economy, bolsters the rule of law and shows "zero tolerance" towards corruption. "I think you can only go so far with this economic model," Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told a news conference in Yerevan. "Armenia is a lower middle-income country. If it wants to become a high-income or upper middle-income country, it can not do so with this kind of economic structure. That is clear." She also called for a sweeping reform of tax and customs administration, the creation of a "strong and independent judicial system" as well as a tough fight against government corruption. The warning was echoed by the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>.

Major monopolies in Armenia include:

"Former" major monopolies in Armenia include:

The <a href="Gross%20Domestic%20Product">Gross Domestic Product</a> of Armenia stood at 8.8 billion <a href="US%20dollars">US dollars</a> in 2010; with a population of 3.2 million, this amounts to a <a href="GDP%20per%20capita">GDP per capita</a> of $2,676 (<a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a> $5,178). GDP growth for 2010 was at 2.9 percent, and inflation was at 8 percent.

GDP growth is expected to be around 3 percent in 2011, with inflation returning to 4-5 percent.

In comparison, in 2006, the GDP was estimated to be 6.6 billion USD per calendar year and the GDP per capita (purchasing power parity) was estimated at $5,400 US. The <a href="Economic%20growth">growth rate</a> was high at 13.4%, but the relatively low base must be considered. Low <a href="inflation">inflation</a> was maintained around 2.6% annually.

After a decade of double-digit growth, Armenia's economy declined by 14.4 percent in 2009. The year-to-date growth as of October 2010 was 2.8 percent. In 2010, the main macro deficiencies of the Armenian economy — namely, unsustainable growth drivers, a narrow and resource-dominated export base, and overdependence on private transfers — were still prevalent.

According to official figures, Armenia’s economy grew by 13.8 percent in 2007. According to research funded by the <a href="USAID">USAID</a> CAPS project, Armenia's exceptionally high rate of economic growth during the last decade has been largely dependent on external factors (e.g., remittances, assistance from international financial and donor organization). Furthermore, the study concluded that despite its record growth on most macro-economic metrics, Armenia is "low and lagging" in competitiveness.

According to the <a href="National%20Statistical%20Service">National Statistical Service</a>, the booming construction and service sectors remain the driving forces of the high growth rate of GDP.

Cash <a href="remittances">remittances</a> sent back home from Armenians working abroad—mostly in Russia and the United States—are growing and contribute significantly to Armenia's Gross Domestic Product (between 15 and 30 percent). They help Armenia sustain double-digit economic growth and finance its massive trade deficit.

According to the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20Armenia">Central Bank of Armenia</a>, during the first half of 2008, cash remittances sent back to Armenia by Armenians working abroad rose by 57.5 percent and totaled $668.6 million USD, equivalent to 15 percent of the country's first-half Gross Domestic Product. However, the latter figures only represent cash remittances processed through Armenian commercial banks. According to <a href="Radio%20Free%20Europe/Radio%20Liberty">RFE/RL</a>, comparable sums are believed to be transferred through non-bank systems, implying that cash remittances make up approximately 30 percent of Armenia's GDP in the first half of 2008.

In 2007, cash remittances through bank transfers rose by 37 percent to a record-high level of $1.32 billion USD. According to the Central Bank of Armenia, in 2005, cash remittances from Armenians working abroad reached a record-high level of $1 billion, which is worth more than one fifth of the country’s 2005 Gross Domestic Product.

Net private transfers decreased in 2009, but saw a continuous increase during the first six months of 2010. Since private transfers from the Diaspora tend to be mostly injected into consumption of imports and not in high value-added sectors, the transfers have not resulted in sizeable increases in productivity.

Armenia experienced a construction boom during the latter part of the 2000s. According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's booming construction sector generated about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP during the first eight months of 2007. According to a World Bank official, 30 percent of Armenia's economy in 2009 came from the construction sector.

However, during the January to September 2010 period, the sector experienced a 5.2 percent year-on-year decrease, which according to the <a href="Civilitas%20Foundation">Civilitas Foundation</a> is an indication of the unsustainability of a sector based on an elite market, with few products for the median or low budgets. This decrease comes despite the fact that an important component of the government stimulus package was to support the completion of ongoing construction projects.

In 2010, retail trade turnover was largely unaltered compared to 2009. The existing monopolies throughout the retail sector have made the sector non-responsive to the crisis and resulted in near zero growth. The aftermath of the crisis has started to shift the structure in the retail sector in favor of food products.

In the 2000s, along with the construction sector, the <a href="services%20sector">services sector</a> was the driving force behind Armenia's recent high economic growth rate. In 2010, the volume of services increased as much as 7.4 percent from January to September, over the same period in 2009.

According to official data, in 2007, a record-high 500,000 <a href="tourists">tourists</a> visited Armenia — most of them ethnic Armenians from Europe, Russia and the United States. 2010 saw a noticeable increase in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Armenia – estimated to be 80,000.

However, according to private tour operators and other individuals familiar with the country’s tourism industry, government claims that hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Armenia each year are inflated. Official statistics show that as many 575,000 tourists visited Armenia from abroad in 2009; the government stated earlier in 2010 that the figure will surpass 620,000 in 2010. However, data from the National Statistical Service shows that there were only 65,000 foreigners staying in Armenian hotels in 2009. Ara Vartanian, the chairman of the Armenian Trade and Industry Chamber, thinks that this measure is a far more objective indicator of the tourist influx into the country. In 2012, as many as 843,330 tourists visited Armenia.

Industrial output was relatively positive throughout 2010, with year-on-year average growth of 10.9 percent in the period January to September 2010, due largely to the mining sector where higher global demand for commodities led to higher prices. According to the National Statistical Service, during the January–August 2007 period, Armenia's <a href="industrial%20sector">industrial sector</a> was the single largest contributor to the country's GDP, but remained largely stagnant with industrial output increasing only by 1.7 percent per year. In 2005, Armenia's industrial output (including electricity) made up about 30 percent of GDP.

40 percent of Armenia's exports in 2009 were <a href="mining">mining</a> exports.

As of 2010, the <a href="agricultural%20sector">agricultural production</a> comprises on average 25 percent of Armenia's GDP. In 2006, the agricultural sector accounted for about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP.

Armenia's agricultural output dropped by 17.9 percent in the period of January–September 2010. This was owing to bad weather, a lack of a government stimulus package, and the continuing effects of decreased agricultural subsidies by the Armenian government (per WTO requirements).

The <a href="Armenian%20government">Armenian government</a> receives <a href="foreign%20aid">foreign aid</a> from the government of the United States through the <a href="United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">United States Agency for International Development</a> and the <a href="Millennium%20Challenge%20Corporation">Millennium Challenge Corporation</a>.

On March 27, 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $235.65 million compact with the Government of Armenia. The single stated goal of the "Armenian Compact" is "the reduction of rural poverty through a sustainable increase in the economic performance of the agricultural sector." The compact includes a $67 million to rehabilitate up to 943 kilometers of rural roads, more than a third of Armenia's proposed "Lifeline road network". The Compact also includes a $146 million project to increase the productivity of approximately 250,000 farm households through improved water supply, higher yields, higher-value crops, and a more competitive agricultural sector.

In 2010, the volume of US assistance to Armenia remained near 2009 levels; however, longer-term decline continued. The original Millennium Challenge Account commitment for $235 million had been reduced to about $175 million due to Armenia’s poor governance record. Thus, the MCC would not complete road construction. Instead, the irrigated agriculture project was headed for completion with apparently no prospects for extension beyond 2011.

With curtailment of the MCC funding, the European Union may replace the US as Armenia’s chief source of foreign aid for the first time since independence. From 2011 to 2013, the European Union is expected to advance at least €157.3 million ($208 million) in aid to Armenia.

In 2010, Armenia’s exports remained resource-dependent, largely because the non-resource-intensive sectors were significantly less competitive. Armenia has not succeeded in increasing and diversifying exports beyond raw materials thus leaving room for a greater vulnerability to external shocks. There was a 43.9 percent increase in overall exports during the January to September period. The main three export destinations were Bulgaria with 15.2 percent of total exports, followed by Germany with 14.2 percent and Russia with 13.9 percent. Raw minerals were the main export sent to Bulgaria and Germany.

The global economic crisis has had less impact on imports because the sector is more diversified than exports. In the first nine months of 2010, imports grew about 19 percent, just about equal to the decline of the same sector in 2009.

During the first half of 2008, Armenia's widening current-account <a href="trade%20deficit">trade deficit</a> grew by 66 percent to $1.39 billion USD, with a 40 percent rise in imports. Furthermore, Armenian exports fell by about one percent to $520 million USD.

According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's trade deficit in 2006 was $1.2 billion with growth in exports being largely flat. During the first 11 months of 2006, net imports grew by 21 percent to $1.95 billion, while exports stood at $895 million, up 0.3 percent from the same period in 2005.

In 2010, EU countries accounted for 32.1 percent of Armenia’s foreign trade. Germany is Armenia’s largest trading partner among EU member states, accounting for 7.2 percent of trade; this is due largely to mining exports. Armenian exports to EU countries have skyrocketed by 65.9 percent, making up more than half of all 2010 January to September exports. Imports from EU countries increased by 17.1 percent, constituting 22.5 percent of all imports.

During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> totaled $200 million. During the first 11 months of 2006, the European Union remained Armenia's largest trading partner, accounting for 34.4 percent of its $2.85 billion commercial exchange during the 11-month period.

Bilateral trade with Russia stood at more than $700 million for the first nine months of 2010 – on track to rebound to $1 billion mark first reached in 2008 prior to the global economic crisis.

During January–February 2007, Armenia’s trade with Russia and other <a href="former%20Soviet%20republics">former Soviet republics</a> was $205.6 million (double the amount from the same period the previous year), making them the country’s number one trading partner. During the first 11 months of 2006, the volume of Armenia’s trade with Russia was $376.8 million or 13.2 percent of the total commercial exchange.

As of early 2011, trade with China is dominated by imports of Chinese goods and accounts for about 10 percent of Armenia's foreign trade. The volume of Chinese-Armenian trade soared by 55 percent to $390 million in January–November 2010. Armenian exports to China, though still modest in absolute terms, nearly doubled in that period.

In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Iran was $200 million - which is approximately equal to the trade between Armenia and Turkey. The number of Iranian tourists has risen in recent years, with an estimated 80,000 Iranian tourists in 2010.

In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Turkey was about $200 million, with trade taking place without open borders, across Georgian territory. This figure is not expected to increase significantly so long as the land border between the Armenia and Turkey remains closed.

From January–September 2010, bilateral trade with the United States measured approximately $150 million, on track for about a 30 percent increase over 2009. An increase in Armenia’s exports to the US in 2009 and 2010 has been due to shipments of aluminum foil.

During the first 11 months of 2006, U.S.-Armenian trade totaled $152.6 million.

The volume of Georgian-Armenian trade remains modest in both relative and absolute terms. According to official Armenian statistics, it rose by 11 percent to $91.6 million in January–November 2010. The figure was equivalent to just over 2 percent of Armenia’s overall foreign trade.

Armenia's national debt has increased significantly since 2008 when public external debt consisted of only 13.5 percent of GDP. By the end of 2010, Armenia’s external debt is projected to form about 42 percent of GDP, and 50 percent in 2012.

As of late November 2009, the Armenian government's <a href="foreign%20debt">foreign debt</a> was around $3 billion USD, having doubled in size over the course of the previous year. With the Armenian government needing more anti-crisis loans from the World Bank and other foreign donors, the <a href="debt-to-GDP%20ratio">debt-to-GDP ratio</a> is expected to exceed 40 percent in 2010. According to a World Bank official, a country that has around 12 percent rate of growth or even lower, at the range of 7 to 8 percent, can afford a level of <a href="public%20debt">public debt</a> of up to 50 percent. The official warned that the debt servicing payments of the Armenian government will surge by 2013 and absorb "quite significant part of tax revenues."

According to another estimate, the ratio between the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the state's foreign debt has reached 46 percent. Economists generally agree that a country is <a href="insolvency">insolvent</a>, if its foreign debt surpasses 50 percent of its GDP. Critics of the government say that the $500 million credit from Russia should have gone to develop industry, instead of going to the construction sector.

Since early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway.

Russian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.

The only operational rail link into Armenia is from <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>. During Soviet times, Armenia's rail network connected to Russia's via Georgia through <a href="Abkhazia">Abkhazia</a> along the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. However, the rail link between Abkhazia and other Georgian regions has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports.

The Georgian Black Sea ports of <a href="Batumi">Batumi</a> and <a href="Poti">Poti</a> process more than 90 percent of freight shipped to and from landlocked Armenia. The Georgian railway, which runs through the town of Gori in central Georgia, is the main transport link between Armenia and the aforementioned Georgian seaports. Fuel, wheat and other basic commodities are transported to Armenia by rail.

Armenia's main rail and road border-crossing with Georgia (at ) is along the <a href="Debed%20river">Debed river</a> near the Armenian town of <a href="Bagratashen">Bagratashen</a> and the Georgian town of <a href="Sadakhlo">Sadakhlo</a>.

The Upper Lars border crossing (at <a href="Darial%20Gorge">Darial Gorge</a>) between Georgia and Russia across the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a> served as Armenia's sole overland route to the former Soviet Union and Europe. It was controversially shut down by the Russian authorities in June 2006, at the height of a Russian-Georgian spy scandal. Upper Lars is the only land border crossing that does not go through Georgia's Russian-backed breakaway regions of <a href="South%20Ossetia">South Ossetia</a> and <a href="Abkhazia">Abkhazia</a>. The other two roads linking Georgia and Russia run through South Ossetia and Abkhazia, effectively barring them to international traffic. This crossing is expected to reopen starting on March 1, 2010.

The closing of the border by Turkey has cut Armenia's <a href="Kars%20Gyumri%20Akhalkalaki%20railway%20line">rail link between Gyumri and Kars</a> to Turkey; the rail link with Iran through the Azeri exclave of Nakhichevan; and a natural gas and oil pipeline line with Azerbaijan. Also non-functioning are roads with Turkey and Azerbaijan. Despite the economic blockade of Turkey on Armenia, every day dozens of Turkish trucks laden with goods enter Armenia through Georgia.

In 2010, it was confirmed that Turkey will keep the border closed for the foreseeable future after the Turkey-Armenia normalization process collapsed.

A <a href="Iran-Armenia%20Natural%20Gas%20Pipeline">new gas pipeline to Iran</a> has been completed, and a road to Iran through the southern city of <a href="Meghri">Meghri</a> allows trade with that country. An oil pipeline to pump Iranian oil products is also in the planning stages.

As of October 2008, the Armenian government is considering implementing an ambitious project to build a railway to Iran. The 400 kilometer railway would pass through Armenia's mountainous southern <a href="Syunik%20Province">province of Syunik</a>, which borders Iran. Economic analysts say that the project would cost at least $1 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of Armenia's 2008 state budget). As of 2010, the project has been continuously delayed, with the rail link estimated to cost as much as $4 billion and stretch . In June 2010, Transport Minister Manuk Vartanian revealed that Yerevan is seeking as much as $1 billion in loans from China to finance the railway’s construction.

According to the state-owned <a href="Armenpress">Armenpress</a> news agency, the average monthly wage in Armenia for the first half of 2007 was 70,700 <a href="Armenian%20dram">dram</a>s (about $210 USD).

As of April 24, 2008, the average monthly salary is 75,000 drams (about $242 US dollars). According to the ROA National Statistical Service, the average monthly salary during January - June 2008 is 86,850 drams (about $287 at the time). About 62% of officially registered wage earners earn at least the average monthly wage, while only 19.6% receive a monthly salary of over 100,000 drams (about $330 at the time).

According to research commissioned by the Yerevan office of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE), at least one in three working-age Armenians was unemployed as of February 2005 despite several consecutive years of double-digit economic growth. The finding sharply contrasts with government's official unemployment rate of about 10 percent. A 2003 household survey conducted by the National Statistical Survey found that the real unemployment rate is about 33 percent.

Since gaining independence in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Armenia's residents have gone abroad, mainly to Russia, in search of work. Unemployment has been the major cause of this massive labor emigration. OSCE experts estimate that between 116,000 and 147,000 people left Armenia for economic reasons between 2002 and 2004, with two-thirds of them returning home by February 2005. According to estimates by the National Statistical Survey, the rate of labor emigration was twice as higher in 2001 and 2002.

According to an OSCE survey, a typical Armenian <a href="migrant%20worker">migrant worker</a> is a married man aged between 41 and 50 years who "began looking for work abroad at the age of 32-33."

In 2010, the value of the Armenian Dram (AMD) was artificially kept high during the height of the global economic crisis. Had the AMD been allowed to depreciate to its market level, exports would have become more competitive and the purchasing power of the majority of the population who are dependent on remittances from abroad would have increased. Instead, the value of the AMD was kept high, out of a fear of inflation and concern about alienating the powerful government-connected importers of oil, sugar, flour, cigarettes and beverages.

The AMD/USD exchange rate depreciated by 6.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, before it began to show the expected end-of-the-year appreciation. In comparison, between the January to October periods of 2010 and 2009, depreciation stands at 4.7 percent.

The Armenian government collected 383.5 billion drams ($1.26 billion) in various taxes in the first nine months of 2008 (a 33.2 percent increase from the same period last year).

Many large companies have a privileged status when it comes to taxation. Big business is not taxed in proportion to its capacity and output, and the disproportionate burden falls on small and medium size businesses.

Over half of the tax revenues in the January–August 2008 time period were generated from <a href="value-added%20tax">value-added tax</a>es (VAT) of 20%. By comparison, corporate profit tax generated less than 16 percent of the revenues. This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens, rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenia's double-digit economic growth in recent years).

Many Armenian companies, especially those owned by government-connected tycoons, have long reported suspiciously low earnings, thereby avoiding paying larger taxes.

Armenia is trying to "address its environmental problems". It has established a Ministry of Environment and has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal. The resulting revenues are used for unknown purposes. Armenia doesn't seem to be interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (a group of 12 former Soviet republics) or with members of the international community on environmental issues. The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant and has already made an agreement with Russian "businessmen" about the construction and operation and ownage of a new Nuclear power plant.

Armenia's financial system is not integrated into the global network. According to the head of the Armenian Central Bank’s (CBA) department for financial system policies and analyses (Vahe Vardanyan) Armenian banks have no large asset concentrations in foreign markets, particularly in capital markets. They nearly have no purchased securities (so-called securitized packages). For this reason, Armenia was virtually unaffected by the <a href="Liquidity%20crisis%20of%20September%202008">Liquidity crisis of September 2008</a>.

Armenian banking assets are very low and make up only 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Since 2000, the Russian state has acquired several key assets in the energy sector and Soviet-era industrial plants. Property-for-debt or equity-for-debt swaps (acquiring ownership by simply writing off the Armenian government's debts to Russia) are usually the method of acquiring assets. The failure of market reforms, clan-based economics, and official <a href="corruption%20in%20Armenia">corruption in Armenia</a> have allowed the success of this process.

In August 2002, the Armenian government sold an 80 percent stake in the <a href="Armenian%20Electricity%20Network">Armenian Electricity Network</a> (AEN) to Midland Resources, a British offshore-registered firm which is said to have close Russian connections.

In September 2002, the Armenian government handed over Armenia’s largest cement factory to the Russian <a href="ITERA">ITERA</a> gas exporter in payment for its $10 million debt for past gas deliveries.

On November 5, 2002, Armenia transferred control of 5 state enterprises to Russia in an assets-for-debts transaction which settled $100 million of Armenian state debts to Russia. The document was signed for Russia by Prime Minister <a href="Mikhail%20Kasyanov">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> and Industry Minister <a href="Ilya%20Klebanov">Ilya Klebanov</a>, while Prime Minister <a href="Andranik%20Markarian">Andranik Markarian</a> and National Security Council Secretary <a href="Serge%20Sarkisian">Serge Sarkisian</a> signed for Armenia. The five enterprises which passed to 100 percent Russian state ownership are:

In January 2003, the Armenian government and <a href="United%20Company%20RUSAL">United Company RUSAL</a> signed an investment cooperation agreement, under which United Company RUSAL (which already owned a 76% stake) acquired the Armenian government's remaining 26% share of <a href="RUSAL%20ARMENAL">RUSAL ARMENAL</a> aluminum foil mill, giving RUSAL 100% ownership of RUSAL ARMENAL.

On November 1, 2006, the Armenian government handed de facto control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline to Russian company <a href="Gazprom">Gazprom</a> and increased Gazprom's stake in the Russian-Armenian company <a href="ArmRosGazprom">ArmRosGazprom</a> from 45% to 58% by approving an additional issue of shares worth $119 million. This left the Armenian government with a 32% stake in ArmRosGazprom. The transaction will also help finance ArmRosGazprom's acquisition of the <a href="Hrazdan%20electricity%20generating%20plant">Hrazdan electricity generating plant</a>’s fifth power bloc (Hrazdan-5), the leading unit in the country.

In October 2008 the Russian bank <a href="Gazprombank">Gazprombank</a>, the banking arm of Gazprom, acquired 100 percent of Armenian bank <a href="Areximbank">Areximbank</a> after previously buying 80 percent of said bank in November 2007 and 94.15 percent in July of the same year.

Critics of the Kocharian government say that the Armenian administration never considered alternative ways of settling the Russian debts. According to economist Eduard Aghajanov, Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million. Furthermore, Aghajanov points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector – abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.

Political observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government’s work. The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and now President) <a href="Serge%20Sarkisian">Serge Sarkisian</a>, Kocharian’s closest political associate. Other top government officials, including Prime Minister <a href="Andranik%20Markarian">Andranik Markarian</a>, had little say on the issue. Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after Sarkisian’s frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.

Finally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multimillion-dollar debts to Russia over the past decade, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia. For example, pro-Western <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.

Armed Forces of Armenia

The Armed Forces of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Armenia">Republic of Armenia</a> () comprise two services: the <a href="Armenian%20Army">Army</a>, and the <a href="Armenian%20Air%20Force">Air Force and Air Defense</a> (a unified branch). It was partially formed out of the former <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet Army</a> forces stationed in the <a href="Armenian%20SSR">Armenian SSR</a> (mostly units of the <a href="7th%20Guards%20Army">7th Guards Army</a> of the <a href="Transcaucasian%20Military%20District">Transcaucasian Military District</a>). Being a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a>, Armenia has no <a href="navy">navy</a>.

The <a href="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> of the military is the <a href="President%20of%20Armenia">President of Armenia</a>, <a href="Serzh%20Sargsyan">Serzh Sargsyan</a>. The Ministry of Defense is in charge of political leadership, headed by Vigen Sargsyan, while military command remains in the hands of the <a href="general%20staff">general staff</a>, headed by the Chief of Staff, who is <a href="Colonel-General">Colonel-General</a> <a href="Movses%20Hakobyan">Movses Hakobyan</a>. <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> established a Ministry of Defense on January 28, 1992. Border guards subject to the Ministry patrol Armenia's borders with <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, while <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n troops continue to monitor its borders with <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. Since 2002, Armenia has been a member of the <a href="Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organization">Collective Security Treaty Organization</a>. Armenia signed a military cooperation plan with <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> on November 27, 2015.

The <a href="Treaty%20on%20Conventional%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20Europe">Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe</a> was ratified by the Armenian parliament in July 1992. The treaty establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of military equipment, such as tanks, artillery, armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft, and combat helicopters, and provides for the destruction of weaponry in excess of those limits. <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>n officials have consistently expressed determination to comply with its provisions and thus Armenia has provided data on armaments as required under the CFE Treaty. Despite this, Azerbaijan accuses Armenia of diverting a large part of its military forces to <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20Republic">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> and thus circumventing these international regulations. Armenia is not a significant exporter of conventional weapons, but it has provided support, including material, to the <a href="Armenian%20people">Armenians</a> of Nagorno-Karabakh during the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">Nagorno-Karabakh War</a>.

In March 1993, Armenia signed the multilateral <a href="Chemical%20Weapons%20Convention">Chemical Weapons Convention</a>, which calls for the eventual elimination of chemical weapons. Armenia acceded to the nuclear <a href="Non-Proliferation%20Treaty">Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> as a non-<a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s state in July 1993. The U.S. and other Western governments have discussed efforts to establish effective nuclear export control systems with Armenia and expressed satisfaction with Armenia's full cooperation.

The Armenian Armed Forces are Headquartered in <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a>, where most of the general staff is based. Headed by Chief of Staff Movses Hakobyan, the general staff is responsible for operational command of the Armenian Military and its three major branches.

In addition to the services listed above, Armenia established its own <a href="Internal%20Troops">Internal Troops</a> from the former Soviet Interior Troops after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Up until December 2002, Armenia maintained a Ministry of Internal Affairs, but along with the Ministry of National Security, it was reorganised as a non-ministerial institution. The two organisations became the Police of the Republic of Armenia and the National Security Service. In February 1999 the Deputy Minister of the Interior and Commander of the Internal Troops, Major General Artsrun Makarian, was found shot dead. In 2013 the <a href="International%20Institute%20for%20Strategic%20Studies">International Institute for Strategic Studies</a> attributed the force with four paramilitary battalions, 55 AIFV including 44 <a href="BMP-1">BMP-1</a>, and 24 wheeled <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s.

According to IISS 2010, Armenia has 20 <a href="T-80">T-80</a> tanks, 137 <a href="T-72">T-72</a> tanks, 8 <a href="T-54/55">T-54/55</a> tanks and 80 <a href="BMP-1">BMP-1</a>'s, 7 BMP-1K, 55 <a href="BMP-2">BMP-2</a> and 12 <a href="BRM-1K">BRM-1K</a>. Wheeled APCs reported included 11 <a href="BTR-60">BTR-60</a>s, 21 <a href="BTR-70">BTR-70</a>s, 4 <a href="BTR-80">BTR-80</a>s, 145 <a href="MT-LB">MT-LB</a>s, 5 <a href="BMD-1">BMD-1</a>S, and 120 <a href="BRDM-2">BRDM-2</a> scout vehicles.

Although the Russians have supplied newer equipment to Armenia over the years, the numbers have never been sufficient to upgrade all ground force formations and many of the lower readiness units still have older, Soviet-legacy systems that have not been upgraded or in many cases effectively maintained. These older systems are placing great demands on the logistics system for service, maintenance, replacement parts and necessary upgrades, costing the army both financially and in overall readiness. The ground force is engaged in an effort of reassessment, reorganisation and restructuring, as the future of Armenia's defence needs a revised force structure and unit mix. The army sees the need to maintain much of its traditional mechanised formations, but is looking to lighten and make more mobile and self-sustainable a small number of other formations. It must develop these newer formations to support its international requirements and effectively operate in mountainous and other rugged terrain, but it must do this without affecting the mechanised capability that is needed to confront Azerbaijan's conventional forces.

Since the fall of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, Armenia has followed a policy of developing its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. In 2000, the <a href="Centre%20for%20International%20Studies%20and%20Research">Centre for International Studies and Research</a> reported that at that time the Armenian Army had the strongest combat capability of the three <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> countries' armies (the other two being <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>). <a href="CSTO">CSTO</a> Secretary, <a href="Nikolay%20Bordyuzha">Nikolay Bordyuzha</a>, came to a similar conclusion after collective military drills in 2007 when he stated that, ""the Armenian Army is the most efficient one in the post-Soviet space"". This was echoed more recently by <a href="Igor%20Korotchenko">Igor Korotchenko</a>, a member of the Public Council, <a href="Russian%20Ministry%20of%20Defense">Russian Ministry of Defense</a>, in a March 2011 interview with <a href="Voice%20of%20Russia">Voice of Russia</a> radio.

The Army is functionally divided into "Active" and "Reserve Forces". Their main functions include deterrence, defense, <a href="peace">peace</a> support and <a href="crisis%20management">crisis management</a>, humanitarian and rescue missions, as well as social functions within Armenian society.

The Active Forces mainly have peacekeeping and defensive duties, and are further divided into Deployment Forces, Immediate Reaction, and Main Defense Forces. The Reserve Forces consists of Enhancement Forces, Territorial Defense Forces, and Training Grounds. They deal with planning and reservist preparation, armaments and equipment storage, training of formations for active forces rotation or increase in personnel.

During peacetime the Army maintains permanent <a href="combat">combat</a> and <a href="mobilization">mobilization</a> readiness. They become part of multinational military formations in compliance with <a href="international%20treaties">international treaties</a> Armenia is a signatory to, participate in the preparation of the population, the national economy and the maintenance of wartime reserves and the <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a> of the country for defense.

In times of crisis the Army's main tasks relate to participation in operations countering <a href="terrorism">terrorist activities</a> and defense of strategic facilities (such as <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> plants and major industrial facilities), assisting the security forces in proliferation of <a href="weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a>, illegal armaments traffic and international terrorism.

In case of low- and medium-intensity military conflict the Active Forces that are part of the Army participate in carrying out the initial tasks for the defense of the <a href="territorial%20integrity">territorial integrity</a> and <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> of the country. In case of a high intensity conflict the Land Forces, together with the Air Force, Air Defense and Border Guards, form the defense group of the Armenian Armed Forces aiming at countering aggression and protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country.

Experiments in developing small arms have been undertaken in Armenia, producing the <a href="K-3%20%28rifle%29">K-3</a> assault rifle, but Jane's Infantry Weapons estimates that the program has ceased, and the rifle is not in widespread service with the army. The <a href="AK-74">AK-74</a> is the standard issue rifle of the Armenian Army with older <a href="AKM">AKM</a>s in reserve use. Beside AK rifles Armenian forces use mostly Russian small arms like the <a href="Makarov%20pistol">Makarov pistol</a>, <a href="Snayperskaya%20Vintovka%20Dragunova">SVD</a> sniper rifle, and the <a href="PK%20machine%20gun">PKM</a> General Purpose machine Gun.

The <a href="Armenian%20Air%20Force">Armenian Air Force</a> consists of 15 <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-25">Su-25</a> ground attack planes, 1 <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-25">MiG-25</a> jet fighter, 16 <a href="Mil%20Mi-24">Mil Mi-24</a> helicopter gunships, 6 <a href="Aero%20L-39%20Albatros">L-39</a> trainer and attack aircraft, 16 <a href="Yakovlev%20Yak-52">Yak-52</a> trainer aircraft, 3 <a href="Ilyushin%20Il-76">Il-76</a> cargo planes, 18 <a href="Mil%20Mi-8">Mil Mi-8</a> transport helicopters, and 10 <a href="Mil%20Mi-2">Mil Mi-2</a> light utility helicopters. There are additional 18 <a href="Mikoyan%20MiG-29">MiG-29</a> fighter jets of the <a href="Russian%20102nd%20Military%20Base">Russian 102nd Military Base</a> stationed in <a href="Gyumri">Gyumri</a>.

The Armenian Air Defense is the anti-aircraft branch of the Armed Forces of Armenia. It was equipped and organized as part of the military reform program of Lieutenant-General <a href="Norat%20Ter-Grigoryants">Norat Ter-Grigoryants</a>. It consists of an anti-aircraft missile brigade and two regiments armed with 100 anti-aircraft complexes of various models and modifications, including the <a href="SA-8">SA-8</a>, <a href="Lyulev%209M8%20Krug">Krug</a>, <a href="S-75%20Dvina">S-75</a>, <a href="S-125">S-125</a>, <a href="SA-7">SA-7</a>, <a href="SA-10">SA-10</a>, <a href="SA-13">SA-13</a>, <a href="SA-16">SA-16</a> and <a href="9K38%20Igla">SA-18</a>. Russia has <a href="SA-6">SA-6</a> and <a href="S-300%20%28missile%29">S-300</a> long range surface-to-air missiles at the Russian 102nd Military Base. There are also 24 <a href="Scud">Scud</a> <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>s with eight launchers.
Numerical strength is estimated at about 3,000 servicemen, with plans for further expansion.

In late December 2010, the Armenian Defense Minister, Seyran Ohanyan, officially acknowledged that the army are equipped with the Russian-made <a href="S-300%20%28missile%29">S-300</a> surface-to-air missiles. The statement was made while the Minister was inspecting a new air-defense command point that maintains "state-of-the-art equipment" built specifically for the operation of the S-300's. Russian specialist started to train Armenian teams on sophisticated Missiles and Defensive Systems. The S-300 was paraded for the first time in the 2011 Parade and the only S-300 system (SA10 Grumble) which likes mobility. The S-300 is the main Air Defensive system that protects Armenia's air security. In the 2016 Armenian Parade celebrating the Armenian Independence <a href="Buk%20missile%20system">BUK-M2</a> Air Defense Systems were shown. These systems were not part of the 200 million dollar contract agreement between Yerevan and Moscow but an agreement between CSTO partners. Other devices such as stem of electronic warfare (EW) "Infauna" and P-325U consist in the Armenian Armed Forces.

In addition to forces mentioned above, there are around 20,000 active soldiers defending <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20Republic">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, a disputed territory which seceded from Azerbaijan in 1991 and is now a <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> independent state. They are well trained and well equipped with the latest in military software and hardware. The Karabakh army's heavy military hardware includes: 316 tanks, 324 armored vehicles, 322 artillery pieces of calibers over 122 mm, 44 multiple rocket launchers, and a new anti-aircraft defense system. In addition, the NKR Defence Army maintains a small air-force of 2 <a href="Su-25">Su-25</a>s, 5 <a href="Mi-24">Mi-24</a>s and 5 other helicopters.

Russia is Armenia's closest ally. The <a href="Russian%20102nd%20Military%20Base">Russian 102nd Military Base</a>, the former 127th Motor Rifle Division, is stationed in <a href="Gyumri">Gyumri</a>. The military alliance of the two nations and, in particular, the presence of Russian troops on Armenian soil has been a key element of Armenia's national security doctrine since Armenia gained independence in 1991. Russia stations an estimated 5,000 soldiers of all types in Armenia, including 3,000 officially reported to be based at the 102nd Military Base. In 1997, the two countries signed a far-reaching friendship <a href="treaty">treaty</a>, which calls for mutual assistance in the event of a military threat to either party and allows <a href="Russian%20border%20guard">Russian border guard</a>s to patrol Armenia's frontiers with <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. In early 2005, the 102nd Military Base had 74 tanks, 17 battle infantry vehicles, 148 armored personnel carriers, 84 artillery pieces, 18 <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a> fighters, one battery of <a href="SA-6">SA-6</a> and two batteries of <a href="SA-10%20Grumble">S-300</a> anti-aircraft missiles. However, in 2005-2007, following an agreement on the withdrawal of two Russian military bases from Georgia, a great deal of military hardware was moved to the 102nd Base from the Russian <a href="12th%20Military%20Base">12th Military Base</a> in <a href="Batumi">Batumi</a> and the 62nd Military Base at <a href="Akhalkalaki">Akhalkalaki</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>. Russia also supplies weapons at the relatively lower prices of the Russian domestic market as part of a collective security agreement since January 2004.

According to unconfirmed reports by the Azeri media, Russia has supplied $1 billion worth of arms and ammunitions to Armenia in 1996; and handed over an additional $800 million worth of arms to Armenia in 2008-2009. According to AzerNews, the weapons in this latest transfer include 21 tanks, 12 armored vehicles, five other battle machines, a great number of rocket launchers, over 1,050 cases of grenades, nearly 7,900 types of ammunition, 120 grenade launchers, over 4,000 sub-machine guns, TNT fuses, mines of various types, 14 mine-launchers, 9 Grad launchers, five cannons, and other weapons.

<a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">Officer</a> <a href="Military%20education%20and%20training">training</a> is another sphere of Russian-Armenian military cooperation. In the first years of <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> when Armenia lacked a military educational establishment of its own, officers of its army were trained in <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. Even now when Armenia has a military <a href="college">college</a> on its own territory, the Armenian officer <a href="corps">corps</a> honors the tradition and is trained at Russian military educational establishments. 600 Armenian servicemen are being trained in Russia. In Armenia as of 1997, the training was conducted by the "In the name of Marshal Bagramyan" Training Brigade.

At the first meeting of the joint Russian-Armenian government panel for military-technical cooperation that took place during autumn 2005, Prime Minister <a href="Mikhail%20Fradkov">Mikhail Fradkov</a> reported that, Russian factories will participate in the Armenian program of military modernization, and that Russia is prepared to supply the necessary spare parts and equipment. In accordance with this agreement, Armenia and Russia agreed to work together in exporting weapons and other military equipment to third countries in December 2009. The export agreement was signed by Defense Minister Seyran Ohanyan and a visiting senior Russian official, Konstantin Biryulin, during a meeting of a Russian-Armenian inter-governmental commission on bilateral military-technical cooperation. The agreement envisages the two countries' interaction in exporting military production to third countries, which will help to strengthen the armed forces of the two states, and further cement the already close Russian-Armenian military cooperation.

A Russian-Armenian defense agreement signed in August 2010 extends Russia's military presence in Armenia till 2044 and commits Russia to supplying Armenia with modern and compatible weaponry and special military hardware at reduced prices.

At the beginning of 2009, Azerbaijani media published allegations that Russia had made extensive weapons transfers to Armenia throughout 2008 costing about $800 million. On January 12, 2009, the Russian ambassador was invited to the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and asked about this information. On January 21, 2009, Russian ministry of foreign relations officially denied the transfers. According to the materials published by <a href="WikiLeaks">WikiLeaks</a> in December 2010, Azerbaijani defence minister <a href="Safar%20Abiyev">Safar Abiyev</a> claimed that in January 2009 during his visit to Moscow, his Russian counterpart <a href="Anatoly%20Serdyukov">Anatoly Serdyukov</a> unofficially had admitted to weapons transfers "after the second bottle of vodka" that evening, although officially it was denied.

In June 2013 it was revealed that Russia has deployed in Armenia several <a href="Iskander-M">Iskander-M</a> ballistic missiles systems, which are stationed at undisclosed locations in the country.

On October 7, 2002, the Presidents of <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>, signed a charter in <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a>, founding the <a href="Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organisation">Collective Security Treaty Organisation</a> (CSTO) (Russian: Организация Договора о Коллективной Безопасности (ОДКБ~ODKB)) or simply Ташкентский договор (The <a href="Tashkent%20Treaty">Tashkent Treaty</a>). <a href="Nikolai%20Bordyuzha">Nikolai Bordyuzha</a> was appointed secretary general of the new organisation. On 23 June 2006, <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> became a full participant in the CSTO and its membership was formally ratified by its parliament on 28 March 2008. Furthermore, the CSTO is an observer organisation at the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly%20observers">United Nations General Assembly</a>.

The charter reaffirmed the desire of all participating states to abstain from the use or threat of force. Signatories would not be able to join other military alliances or other groups of states, while aggression against one signatory would be perceived as an aggression against all. To this end, the CSTO holds yearly military command exercises for the CSTO nations to have an opportunity to improve inter-organisation cooperation. The largest-scale CSTO military exercise held, to date, were the "Rubezh 2008" exercises hosted in <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> where a combined total of 4,000 troops from all 7 constituent CSTO member countries conducted operative, strategic, and tactical training with an emphasis towards furthering the efficiency of the collective security element of the CSTO partnership.

The Ministry of Defense of Armenia has repeatedly stated that it would expect direct military assistance from the CSTO in case war with Azerbaijan resumes, as recently as December 2009, Defense Minister Ohanyan made the same statement. In August 2009, Nikolay Bordyuzha, the CSTO's secretary-general, confirmed that official <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> can count on such support.

On February 4, 2009, an agreement to create the Collective Rapid Reaction Force (KSOR) was reached by five of the seven CSTO members, with plans finalized on June 14, 2009. Armenia is one of the five member states. The force is intended to be used to repulse military aggression, conduct <a href="anti-terrorist">anti-terrorist</a> operations, fight <a href="transnational%20crime">transnational crime</a> and <a href="drug%20trafficking">drug trafficking</a>, and neutralize the effects of <a href="natural%20disaster">natural disaster</a>s.

Armenia participates in <a href="NATO">NATO</a>'s <a href="Partnership%20for%20Peace">Partnership for Peace</a> (PiP) program and it is in a NATO organization called <a href="Euro-Atlantic%20Partnership%20Council">Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council</a> (EAPC). Armenia is in the process of implementation of <a href="Individual%20Partnership%20Action%20Plan">Individual Partnership Action Plan</a>s (IPAPs), which is a program for those countries that have the political will and ability to deepen their relationship with NATO. Cooperative Best Effort exercise (the first where Russia was represented) was run on Armenian territory in 2003.

<a href="Greece">Greece</a> is Armenia's closest ally in NATO and the two cooperate on multiple issues. A number of Armenian officers are trained in Greece every year, and military aid/material assistance has been provided to Armenia. In 2003, the two countries signed a military cooperation accord, under which Greece will increase the number of Armenian servicemen trained at the military and military-medical academies in Athens.

In February 2003, <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> sent 34 peace keepers to <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> where they became part of the <a href="Greece">Greek</a> contingent. Officials in <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> have said the Armenian military plans to substantially increase the size of its peace-keeping detachment and counts on Greek assistance to the effort. In June 2008, Armenia sent 72 peacekeepers to Kosovo for a total of 106 peacekeepers.

<a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> has been sharing experience and providing consultations to the Armenian Defense Ministry in the field of democratic control of armed forces, military and defense concepts and public relations since 2002. Started in 2004, Armenian officers have been invited to study at the Lithuanian War Academy and the Baltic Defense College in <a href="Tartu">Tartu</a>, <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>. Lithuania covers all study expenditures. In early 2007, two Armenian officers for the first time took part in a Baltic lead international exercise, Amber Hope, which was held in Lithuania.

The <a href="United%20States">United States</a> has been steadily upping its military clout in the region. In early 2003, <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> announced several major military programs in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">Washington's</a> military aid to Armenia in 2005 amounted to $5 million, and in April 2004, the two sides signed a military-technical cooperation accord. In late 2004, Armenia deployed a unit of 46 soldiers, which included bomb-disposal experts, <a href="Physician">doctor</a>s, and transport specialists, to Iraq as part of the American-led <a href="Multi-National%20Force%20Iraq">Multi-National Force Iraq</a>. In 2005, the United States allocated $7 million to modernize the military communications of the Armenian Armed Forces.

Since 2003, Armenia and the <a href="Kansas%20National%20Guard">Kansas National Guard</a> have exchanged military delegations as part of a <a href="National%20Guard%20Bureau">National Guard Bureau</a> program to promote better relations between the United States and developing nations. The program has largely consisted of mutual visits to each other's countries in an effort to share "ideas and [the] best practices for military and emergency management."

As of 2015, Armenia is involved in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Lebanon. Armenia has plans to send one officer to <a href="Mali">Mali</a> as part of the peacekeeping mission there.

There are 70 Armenian soldiers serving in <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> as peacekeepers.

Armenia joined the <a href="Kosovo%20Force">Kosovo Force</a> in <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> in 2004. Armenian "blue helmets" serve within the <a href="Greek%20Army">Greek Army</a> battalion. The relevant memorandum was signed on September 3, 2003, in <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> and ratified by the Armenian Parliament on December 13, 2003. The sixth deployment of Armenian peacekeepers departed for Kosovo on November 14, 2006. In 2008, the Armenian National Assembly voted unanimously to double the peacekeeping force in Kosovo by sending an extra 34 peacekeepers to the region, increasing the total number of peacekeepers in the region to 68. 
Armenia temporarily withdrew its peacekeepers from Kosovo in February 2012 as a result of the reduction of the Greek sundivisions. Armenia redeployed them in July to serve alongside American soldiers in Kosovo.

After the end of the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a>, Armenia deployed a unit of 46 peacekeepers under <a href="Poland">Polish</a> command. Armenian peacekeepers were based in <a href="Al-Kut">Al-Kut</a>, 62 miles from the capital of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>. On July 23, 2006, the fourth shift of Armenian peacekeepers departed for Iraq. The shift included 3 staff commanders, 2 medical officers, 10 combat engineers and 31 drivers. Throughout the length of the deployment, there was one Armenian wounded and no deaths. The Armenian government extended the small troop presence in Iraq by one year at the end of 2005 and 2006. On October 7, 2008, Armenia withdrew its contingent of 46 peacekeepers. This coincided with the withdrawal of the Polish contingent in Iraq.

Armenia deploys 130 soldiers in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). They are serving under <a href="Germany">German</a> command protecting an <a href="airport">airport</a> in <a href="Konduz">Konduz</a>.

In 2014, Armenia deployed 33 peacekeepers to <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> as part of <a href="United%20Nations%20Interim%20Force%20in%20Lebanon">UNIFIL</a>. They currently serve under the <a href="Italian%20Army">Italian contingent</a> and fulfill headquarter security functions.

Foreign relations of Armenia

<a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> has maintained a policy of complementarism by trying to have positive and friendly relations with Iran, Russia, and the West, including the United States and the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> since its independence. It has full membership status in a number of international organizations and observer status, etc. in some others. However, the dispute over the <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> of 1915 and the recent war over Nagorno–Karabakh have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey.

As of 2017, 29 states have officially recognized the historical events as genocide. Parliaments of countries that recognize the Armenian Genocide include Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Paraguay, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Uruguay, Vatican City and Venezuela. Additionally, some regional governments of countries recognize the Armenian genocide too, such as <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> in Australia as well as Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales in the United Kingdom. <a href="US%20House%20Resolution%20106">US House Resolution 106</a> was introduced on 30 January 2007, and later referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The bill has 225 co-sponsors. The bill called for former President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> to recognize and use the word genocide in his annual 24 April speech which he never used. His successor President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> expressed his desire to recognize the Armenian Genocide during the electoral campaigns, but after being elected, has not used the word "genocide" to describe the events that occurred in 1915.

Armenia supports Armenians in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Artsakh">Republic of Artsakh</a> in the longstanding, and very bitter conflict against the Azerbaijani government.

The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in Nagorno–Karabakh and later in Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh <a href="Supreme%20Soviet">Supreme Soviet</a> voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against Armenians in Azerbaijan and Azeris in Armenia. In 1990, after violent episodes in Nagorno–Karabakh and Azerbaijani cities like <a href="Baku">Baku</a>, <a href="Sumgait">Sumgait</a> and <a href="Kirovabad">Kirovabad</a>, Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sending troops to the region, and <a href="Black%20January">forcibly occupied Baku</a>, killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian populations in Karabakh, known as <a href="Operation%20Ring">Operation Ring</a>. Moscow also deployed troops to <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a>. Following the collapse of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, conflict escalated into a full-scale war between the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, supported by Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring sides in order to keep both under control.

More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting during the period of 1988 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized <a href="Shusha">Shusha</a> and <a href="Lachin">Lachin</a> (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in taking almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the <a href="UN%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a> adopted <a href="List%20of%20United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20resolutions%20on%20the%20Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">four resolutions</a> calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 at which time Russia brokered a cease-fire between the three sides.

Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a>. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, <a href="sniper">sniper</a>-fire and <a href="land%20mine">landmine</a> incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.

Since 1997, the Minsk Group co-chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. Each proposal was rejected. Beginning in 1999, the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. The OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the presidents in <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a>, Florida. U.S. Secretary of State <a href="Colin%20Powell">Colin Powell</a> launched the talks 3 April 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia and France until 6 April 2001. The Co-Chairs are still continuing to work with the two presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.

The two countries are still at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of <a href="Armenian%20diaspora">Armenian descent</a>, are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan. If a person's passport shows evidence of travel to Nagorno–Karabakh, they are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.

In 2008, in what became known as the <a href="2008%20Mardakert%20Skirmishes">2008 Mardakert Skirmishes</a>, Armenia forces and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.

Greco-Roman (<a href="Middle%20Platonism">Mid-</a> and <a href="Neoplatonism">Neo-Platonic</a>, and <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian</a>) texts translated by the <a href="Al-Kindi">Kindi</a> <a href="school">school</a> were commented, redacted and developed substantially by Islamic <a href="intellectuals">intellectuals</a>, who also built upon Persian and <a href="Indian%20mathematics">Indian mathematical</a> <a href="systems">systems</a>, <a href="Indian%20astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="algebra">algebra</a>, <a href="trigonometry">trigonometry</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Iranian%20Medicine">medicine</a>. The <a href="Samanid%20dynasty">Samanid dynasty</a> in the eastern part of <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Greater Khorasan</a> and <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> as well as the <a href="Buyid%20dynasty">Buyid dynasty</a> in the western part of <a href="Persia">Persia</a> and <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> provided a thriving <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> for <a href="Scholarly%20method">scholarly</a> and <a href="Culture">cultural</a> development. Under the Samanids, <a href="Bukhara">Bukhara</a> rivaled <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> as a cultural <a href="capital%20city">capital</a> of the <a href="Islamic%20world">Islamic world</a>.

The study of the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> and the <a href="Hadith">Hadith</a> thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere. Philosophy, <a href="Fiqh">Fiqh</a> and <a href="theology">theology</a> (<a href="kalaam">kalaam</a>) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. <a href="Al-Razi">Al-Razi</a> and <a href="Al-Farabi">Al-Farabi</a> had provided <a href="methodology">methodology</a> and <a href="knowledge">knowledge</a> in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great <a href="libraries">libraries</a> of <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a>, <a href="Khwarezm">Khwarezm</a>, <a href="Gorgan">Gorgan</a>, <a href="Ray%2C%20Iran">Rey</a>, <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a> and <a href="Hamadan">Hamadan</a>. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. <a href="Aruzi%20Samarqandi">Aruzi Samarqandi</a> describes how before Avicenna left <a href="Khwarezm">Khwarezm</a> he had met <a href="Al-Biruni">Al-Biruni</a> (a famous scientist and astronomer), <a href="Abu%20Nasr%20Mansur">Abu Nasr Iraqi</a> (a renowned mathematician), <a href="Abu%20Sahl%20Masihi">Abu Sahl Masihi</a> (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician).

Avicenna was born in Afshana, a <a href="village">village</a> near <a href="Bukhara">Bukhara</a> (in present-day <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>), the <a href="capital%20city">capital</a> of the <a href="Samanids">Samanids</a>, a Persian <a href="dynasty">dynasty</a> in <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> and <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Greater Khorasan</a>. His <a href="mother">mother</a>, named Sitāra, was from Bukhara; his father, Abdullāh, was a respected <a href="Ismaili">Ismaili</a> scholar from <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a>, an <a href="important">important</a> <a href="town">town</a> of the <a href="Samanid%20Empire">Samanid Empire</a>, in what is today <a href="Balkh%20Province">Balkh Province</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. His father worked in the government of <a href="Samanid%20Empire">Samanid</a> in the village Kharmasain, a <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> regional power. After five years, his younger brother, Mahmoud, was born. Avicenna first began to learn the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> and literature in such a way that when he was ten years old he had essentially learned all of them.

According to his autobiography, Avicenna had memorised the entire Quran by the age of 10. He learned <a href="Indian%20mathematics">Indian arithmetic</a> from an <a href="History%20of%20India">Indian</a> greengrocer,ءMahmoud Massahi and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young. He also studied Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) under the <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="Hanafi">Hanafi</a> scholar Ismail al-Zahid. Avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as Introduction (<a href="Isagoge">Isagoge</a>)'s <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry (philosopher)</a>, <a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Euclid's Elements</a>, <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy's</a> <a href="Almagest">Almagest</a> by an unpopular philosopher, Abu Abdullah Nateli, who claimed philosophizing.

As a teenager, he was greatly troubled by the "<a href="Metaphysics%20%28Aristotle%29">Metaphysics</a>" of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, which he could not understand until he read <a href="al-Farabi">al-Farabi's</a> commentary on the work. For the next year and a half, he studied <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite <a href="wudu">ablutions</a>, then go to the mosque, and continue in <a href="salat">prayer</a> till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the "Metaphysics" of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by <a href="Farabi">Farabi</a>, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.

He turned to medicine at 16, and not only learned medical theory, but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment. The teenager achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18, and found that "Medicine is no hard and thorny science, like <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, so I soon made great progress; I became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients, using approved remedies." The youthful physician's fame spread quickly, and he treated many patients without asking for payment.

A number of theories have been proposed regarding Avicenna's <a href="madhab">madhab</a> (school of thought within Islamic jurisprudence). Medieval historian Ẓahīr al-dīn al-Bayhaqī (d. 1169) considered Avicenna to be a follower of the <a href="Brethren%20of%20Purity">Brethren of Purity</a>. On the other hand, <a href="Dimitri%20Gutas">Dimitri Gutas</a> along with Aisha Khan and Jules J. Janssens demonstrated that Avicenna was a <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="Hanafi">Hanafi</a>. However, the 14th century <a href="Shia">Shia</a> <a href="faqih">faqih</a> <a href="Qazi%20Nurullah%20Shustari">Nurullah Shushtari</a> according to <a href="Seyyed%20Hossein%20Nasr">Seyyed Hossein Nasr</a>, maintained that he was most likely a <a href="Twelver%20Shia">Twelver Shia</a>. Conversely, <a href="Sharaf%20Khorasani">Sharaf Khorasani</a>, citing a rejection of an invitation of the Sunni Governor Sultan Mahmoud Ghazanavi by Avicenna to his court, believes that Avicenna was an <a href="Ismaili">Ismaili</a>. Similar disagreements exist on the background of Avicenna's family, whereas some writers considered them Sunni, some more recent writers contested that they were Shia.

Ibn Sina's first appointment was that of physician to the <a href="emir">emir</a>, <a href="Nuh%20II">Nuh II</a>, who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness (997). Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.

When Ibn Sina was 22 years old, he lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of <a href="Mahmud%20of%20Ghazni">Mahmud of Ghazni</a>, and proceeded westwards to <a href="Konye-Urgench">Urgench</a> in modern <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, where the <a href="vizier">vizier</a>, regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of <a href="Nishapur">Nishapur</a> and <a href="Merv">Merv</a> to the borders of <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorasan</a>, seeking an opening for his talents. <a href="Qabus">Qabus</a>, the generous ruler of <a href="Tabaristan">Tabaristan</a>, himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at <a href="Gorgan">Gorgan</a>, near the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on <a href="logic">logic</a> and <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>. Several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his "Canon of Medicine" also dates from his stay in <a href="Hyrcania">Hyrcania</a>.

Ibn Sina subsequently settled at <a href="Rey%2C%20Iran">Rey</a>, in the vicinity of modern <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, the home town of <a href="Al-Razi">Rhazes</a>; where <a href="Abu%20Taleb%20Rostam">Majd Addaula</a>, a son of the last <a href="Buwayhid">Buwayhid</a> emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother (<a href="Seyyedeh%20Khatun">Seyyedeh Khatun</a>). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, <a href="Shams%20al-Daula">Shams al-Daula</a>, however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at <a href="Qazvin%20%28city%29">Qazvin</a> he passed southwards to Hamadãn where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the "Canon" and the "Sanatio", were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a>, where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.

Meanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a>, offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamadãn; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a>. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.

The remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn Sīnā's life were spent in the service of the <a href="Kakuyid">Kakuyid</a> ruler <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Rustam%20Dushmanziyar">Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar</a> (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.

During these years he began to study literary matters and <a href="philology">philology</a>, instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe <a href="colic">colic</a>, which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.

His friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately. He refused, however, stating that: ""I prefer a short life with width to a narrow one with length"". On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods on the poor, restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and read through the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> every three days until his death. He died in June 1037, in his fifty-eighth year, in the month of <a href="Ramadan">Ramadan</a> and was buried in <a href="Hamadan">Hamadan</a>, Iran.

Ibn Sīnā wrote extensively on <a href="early%20Islamic%20philosophy">early Islamic philosophy</a>, especially the subjects <a href="logic">logic</a>, <a href="ethics">ethics</a>, and <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, including treatises named "Logic" and "Metaphysics". Most of his works were written in <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> – then the language of science in the Middle East – and some in Persian. Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Ibn Sīnā's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher, encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of <a href="ijtihad">ijtihad</a>.

Avicenna's <a href="Platonism%20in%20Islamic%20Philosophy">Neoplatonic</a> scheme of "emanations" became fundamental in the "<a href="Kalam">Kalam</a>" (school of theological discourse) in the 12th century.

His "Book of Healing" became available in Europe in partial Latin translation some fifty years after its composition, under the title "Sufficientia", and some authors have identified a "Latin Avicennism" as flourishing for some time, paralleling the more influential <a href="Latin%20Averroism">Latin Averroism</a>, but suppressed by the <a href="Condemnations%20of%201210%E2%80%931277">Parisian decrees of 1210 and 1215</a>.
Avicenna's psychology and theory of knowledge influenced <a href="William%20of%20Auvergne%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Paris">William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris</a> and <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a>, while his metaphysics influenced the thought of <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>.

Early Islamic philosophy and <a href="Islamic%20metaphysics">Islamic metaphysics</a>, imbued as it is with <a href="Kalam">Islamic theology</a>, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from <a href="Occasionalism">Occasionalism</a> can be seen in what is left of his work.

Following al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence ("Mahiat") and existence ("Wujud"). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an <a href="Causality">agent-cause</a> that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.

Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself ("mumkin bi-dhatihi") has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' ("wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi"). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself ("wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi") is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.

The Necessary exists 'due-to-Its-Self', and has no quiddity/essence ("mahiyya") other than existence ("wujud"). Furthermore, It is 'One' ("wahid ahad") since there cannot be more than one 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without differentia (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require differentia entails that they exist 'due-to-themselves' as well as 'due to what is other than themselves'; and this is contradictory. However, if no differentia distinguishes them from each other, then there is no sense in which these 'Existents' are not one and the same. Avicenna adds that the 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' has no genus ("jins"), nor a definition ("hadd"), nor a counterpart ("nadd"), nor an opposite ("did"), and is detached ("bari") from matter ("madda"), quality ("kayf"), quantity ("kam"), place ("ayn"), situation ("wad"), and time ("waqt").

Avicenna's theology on metaphysical issues ("ilāhiyyāt") has been criticized by some Islamic scholars, among them <a href="al-Ghazali">al-Ghazali</a>, <a href="Ibn%20Taymiyya">Ibn Taymiyya</a>, and <a href="Ibn%20al-Qayyim">Ibn al-Qayyim</a>. While discussing the views of the theists among the Greek philosophers, namely <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in "Al-Munqidh min ad-Dalal" ("Deliverance from Error"), al-Ghazali noted that the Greek philosophers "must be taxed with unbelief, as must their partisans among the Muslim philosophers, such as Ibn Sina and al-Farabi and their likes." He added that "None, however, of the Muslim philosophers engaged so much in transmitting Aristotle's lore
as did the two men just mentioned. [...] The sum of what we regard as the authentic philosophy of Aristotle, as transmitted by al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, can be reduced to three parts: a part which must be branded as unbelief; a part which must be stigmatized as innovation; and a part which need not be repudiated at all.

Avicenna made an <a href="argument">argument</a> for the <a href="existence%20of%20God">existence of God</a> which would be known as the "<a href="Proof%20of%20the%20Truthful">Proof of the Truthful</a>" (<a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>: "al-burhan al-siddiqin"). Avicenna argued that there must be a "necessary existent" (Arabic: "wajib al-wujud"), an entity that cannot "not" exist, and through a series of argument, he identified it with <a href="God%20of%20Islam">God of Islam</a>. Present-day <a href="History%20of%20philosophy">historian of philosophy</a> <a href="Peter%20Adamson%20%28philosopher%29">Peter Adamson</a> called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy.

Correspondence between Ibn Sina (with his student Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Ma'sumi) and <a href="Al-Biruni">Al-Biruni</a> has survived in which they debated <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian</a> <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a> and the <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic school</a>. Abu Rayhan began by asking Avicenna eighteen questions, ten of which were criticisms of Aristotle's "<a href="On%20the%20Heavens">On the Heavens</a>".

Avicenna was a devout Muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with Islamic theology. His aim was to prove the existence of God and His creation of the world scientifically and through <a href="reason">reason</a> and <a href="logic">logic</a>. Avicenna's views on Islamic theology (and philosophy) were enormously influential, forming part of the core of the curriculum at Islamic religious schools until the 19th century. Avicenna wrote a number of short treatises dealing with Islamic theology. These included treatises on the <a href="Islamic%20prophet">prophets</a> (whom he viewed as "inspired philosophers"), and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the Quran, such as how Quranic <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> corresponds to his own philosophical system. In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.

There are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider <a href="epistemological">epistemological</a> matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.

Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as <a href="Nasir%20al-Din%20al-Tusi">al-Tusi</a>) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as <a href="al-Razi">al-Razi</a>) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as <a href="al-Ghazali">al-Ghazali</a>) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means. It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the <a href="madrasahs">madrasahs</a>.

Avicenna <a href="Hafiz%20%28Quran%29">memorized the Quran</a> by the age of ten, and as an adult, he wrote five treatises commenting on <a href="sura">sura</a>s from the Quran. One of these texts included the "Proof of Prophecies", in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.

While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous "<a href="floating%20man">Floating Man</a>" – literally falling man – <a href="thought%20experiment">thought experiment</a> to demonstrate human <a href="self-awareness">self-awareness</a> and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his "Floating Man" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all , which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have <a href="self-consciousness">self-consciousness</a>. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from <a href="empirical%20evidence">sense experience</a>, would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance. The conceivability of this "Floating Man" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human <a href="nous">intelligence</a>, particularly the <a href="active%20intellect">active intellect</a>, which he believed to be the <a href="hypostatic%20abstraction">hypostasis</a> by which God communicates <a href="truth">truth</a> to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to <a href="nature">nature</a>. Following is an English translation of the argument:

However, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation. Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect. The first knowledge of the flying person would be "I am," affirming his or her essence. That essence could not be the body, obviously, as the flying person has no sensation. Thus, the knowledge that "I am" is the core of a human being: the soul exists and is self-aware. Avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the <a href="self%20%28philosophy%29">self</a> is not logically dependent on any physical <a href="Object%20%28philosophy%29">thing</a>, and that the soul should not be seen in <a href="relative%20term">relative term</a>s, but as a primary given, a <a href="substance%20theory">substance</a>. The body is unnecessary; in relation to it, the soul is its perfection. In itself, the soul is an immaterial substance.

Avicenna authored a five-volume medical encyclopedia: "The Canon of Medicine" ("Al-Qanun fi't-Tibb"). It was used as the standard medical textbook in the Islamic world and Europe up to the 18th century. The "Canon" still plays an important role in <a href="Unani%20medicine">Unani medicine</a>.

Avicenna considered whether events like rare diseases or disorders have natural causes. He used the example of <a href="polydactyly">polydactyly</a> to explain his perception that causal reasons exist for all medical events. This view of medical phenomena anticipated developments in the <a href="Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> by seven centuries.

Ibn Sīnā wrote on <a href="Earth%20science">Earth science</a>s such as <a href="geology">geology</a> in "The Book of Healing". While discussing the formation of <a href="mountain">mountain</a>s, he explained:

In the "Al-Burhan" ("On Demonstration") section of "The Book of Healing", Avicenna discussed the <a href="philosophy%20of%20science">philosophy of science</a> and described an early <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a> of <a href="inquiry">inquiry</a>. He discusses Aristotle's "<a href="Posterior%20Analytics">Posterior Analytics</a>" and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of "How does one acquire the first principles of a science?" He asked how a scientist would arrive at "the initial <a href="axiom">axiom</a>s or <a href="hypothesis">hypotheses</a> of a <a href="deductive%20reasoning">deductive</a> science without inferring them from some more basic premises?" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a "relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty." Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the <a href="first%20principle">first principle</a>s: the ancient Aristotelian method of <a href="inductive%20reasoning">induction</a> ("istiqra"), and the method of <a href="Hypothesis">examination</a> and <a href="experiment">experiment</a>ation ("tajriba"). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that "it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide." In its place, he develops a "method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry."

An early formal system of <a href="temporal%20logic">temporal logic</a> was studied by Avicenna. Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between "temporalis" and the implication. Avicenna's work was further developed by <a href="Najm%20al-D%C4%ABn%20al-Qazw%C4%ABn%C4%AB%20al-K%C4%81tib%C4%AB">Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī</a> and became the dominant system of <a href="Logic%20in%20Islamic%20philosophy">Islamic logic</a> until modern times. Avicennian logic also influenced several early European logicians such as <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="William%20of%20Ockham">William of Ockham</a>. Avicenna endorsed the law of noncontradiction proposed by Aristotle, that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used. He stated, "Anyone who denies the law of noncontradiction should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten, and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned."

In <a href="mechanics">mechanics</a>, Ibn Sīnā, in "The Book of Healing", developed a theory of <a href="motion%20%28physics%29">motion</a>, in which he made a distinction between the inclination (tendency to motion) and <a href="force">force</a> of a <a href="projectile">projectile</a>, and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination ("mayl") transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that <a href="projectile%20motion">projectile motion</a> in a vacuum would not cease. He viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as <a href="air%20resistance">air resistance</a>.

The theory of motion presented by Avicenna was probably influenced by the 6th-century Alexandrian scholar <a href="John%20Philoponus">John Philoponus</a>. Avicenna's is a less sophisticated variant of the <a href="theory%20of%20impetus">theory of impetus</a> developed by <a href="Buridan">Buridan</a> in the 14th century. It is unclear if Buridan was influenced by Avicenna, or by Philoponus directly.

In <a href="optics">optics</a>, Ibn Sina was among those who argued that light had a speed, observing that "if the perception of <a href="light">light</a> is due to the emission of some sort of <a href="Subatomic%20particle">particles</a> by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite." He also provided a wrong explanation of the <a href="rainbow">rainbow</a> phenomenon. <a href="Carl%20Benjamin%20Boyer">Carl Benjamin Boyer</a> described Avicenna's ("Ibn Sīnā") theory on the rainbow as follows:

In 1253, a Latin text entitled "Speculum Tripartitum" stated the following regarding Avicenna's theory on <a href="heat">heat</a>:

Avicenna's legacy in classical psychology is primarily embodied in the "Kitab al-nafs" parts of his "Kitab al-shifa" ("The Book of Healing") and "Kitab al-najat" ("The Book of Deliverance"). These were known in Latin under the title <a href="De%20Anima">De Anima</a> (treatises "on the soul"). Notably, Avicenna develops what is called the "flying man" argument in the Psychology of "The Cure" I.1.7 as defense of the argument that the soul is without quantitative extension, which has an affinity with <a href="Descartes">Descartes's</a> "cogito" argument (or what <a href="phenomenology%20%28philosophy%29">phenomenology</a> designates as a form of an ""epoche"").

Avicenna's psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality. Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.

The soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter. This process requires a concrete particular (material) to be abstracted into the universal intelligible (immaterial). The material and immaterial interact through the Active Intellect, which is a "divine light" containing the intelligible forms. The Active Intellect reveals the universals concealed in material objects much like the sun makes color available to our eyes.

Avicenna wrote an attack on astrology titled "Resāla fī ebṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm", in which he cited passages from the Quran to dispute the power of astrology to foretell the future. He believed that each planet had some influence on the earth, but argued against astrologers being able to determine the exact effects.

Avicenna's astronomical writings had some influence on later writers, although in general his work could be considered less developed than <a href="Alhazen">Alhazen</a> or <a href="Al-Biruni">Al-Biruni</a>. One important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as a separate discipline to astrology. He criticized Aristotle's view of the <a href="star">star</a>s receiving their light from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, stating that the stars are self-luminous, and believed that the <a href="planet">planet</a>s are also self-luminous. He claimed to have observed <a href="Transit%20of%20Venus">Venus as a spot on the Sun</a>. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing <a href="geocentric">geocentric</a> model.

He also wrote the "Summary of the Almagest", (based on <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy's</a> "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>"), with an appended treatise "to bring that which is stated in the Almagest and what is understood from Natural Science into conformity". For example, Avicenna considers the motion of the solar <a href="apogee">apogee</a>, which Ptolemy had taken to be fixed.

Ibn Sīnā invented steam distillation and used it to produce essential oils such as rose essence, forming the foundation of what later became <a href="aromatherapy">aromatherapy</a>.

Unlike, for example, al-Razi, Ibn Sīnā explicitly disputed the theory of the <a href="Philosopher%27s%20stone">transmutation of substances</a> commonly believed by <a href="alchemy">alchemists</a>:

Four works on alchemy attributed to Avicenna were translated into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as:

Ibn Sina classified minerals into stones, fusible substances, sulfurs, and salts, building on the ideas of Aristotle and Jabir. The "epistola de Re recta" is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy; Anawati argues that it is by Avicenna, but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible.

Almost half of Ibn Sīnā's works are versified. His poems appear in both Arabic and Persian. As an example, <a href="Edward%20Granville%20Browne">Edward Granville Browne</a> claims that the following Persian verses are incorrectly attributed to <a href="Omar%20Khayy%C3%A1m">Omar Khayyám</a>, and were originally written by Ibn Sīnā:

As early as the 13th century when <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> depicted him in Limbo alongside the virtuous non-Christian thinkers in his "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>" such as <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, <a href="Averroes">Averroes</a>, <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, <a href="Horace">Horace</a>, <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>, <a href="Lucan">Lucan</a>, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, and <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>, Avicenna has been recognized by both East and West, as one of the great figures in intellectual history.

<a href="George%20Sarton">George Sarton</a>, the author of "The History of Science", described Ibn Sīnā as "one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history" and called him "the most famous <a href="Islamic%20science">scientist of Islam</a> and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times." He was one of the Islamic world's leading writers in the field of medicine.
Along with <a href="al-Razi">Rhazes</a>, <a href="Abu%20al-Qasim%20al-Zahrawi">Abulcasis</a>, <a href="Ibn%20al-Nafis">Ibn al-Nafis</a>, and <a href="al-Ibadi">al-Ibadi</a>, Ibn Sīnā is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in the Western <a href="history%20of%20medicine">history of medicine</a> as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle's position to take into account post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge. Aristotle's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna's linking of Galen's medical writings with Aristotle's philosophical writings in the "Canon of Medicine" (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the "Canon" was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, ("prince of physicians").

In modern <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, he is considered a national icon, and is often regarded as one of the greatest Persians to have ever lived. A monument was erected outside the Bukhara museum. The <a href="Avicenna%20Mausoleum%20and%20Museum">Avicenna Mausoleum and Museum</a> in <a href="Hamadan">Hamadan</a> was built in 1952. <a href="Bu-Ali%20Sina%20University">Bu-Ali Sina University</a> in Hamadan (Iran),
<a href="Avicenna%20Research%20Institute">Avicenna Research Institute</a> in Tehran (Iran), the "ibn Sīnā" Tajik State Medical University in <a href="Dushanbe">Dushanbe</a>, <a href="Ibn%20Sina%20Academy%20of%20Medieval%20Medicine%20and%20Sciences">Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences</a> at <a href="Aligarh">Aligarh</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Avicenna%20School">Avicenna School</a> in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> and <a href="Avicenna%20Medical%20College">Avicenna Medical College</a> in <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> Ibne Sina Balkh Medical School in his native province of <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a> in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, Ibni Sina Faculty Of Medicine of Ankara University <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, the main classroom building (the Avicenna Building) of the <a href="Sharif%20University%20of%20Technology">Sharif University of Technology</a>, and Ibn Sina Integrated School in Marawi City (Philippines) are all named in his honour. His portrait hangs in the Hall of the Avicenna Faculty of Medicine in the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a>. There is also a crater on the Moon named <a href="Avicenna%20%28crater%29">Avicenna</a> and a plant genus "<a href="Avicennia">Avicennia</a>".
In 1980, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, which then ruled his birthplace Bukhara, celebrated the thousandth anniversary of Avicenna's birth by circulating various <a href="commemorative%20stamp">commemorative stamp</a>s with artistic illustrations, and by erecting a <a href="bust%20%28sculpture%29">bust</a> of Avicenna based on <a href="anthropological">anthropological</a> research by Soviet scholars.
Near his birthplace in Qishlak Afshona, some north of Bukhara, a training college for medical staff has been named for him.
On the grounds is a museum dedicated to his life, times and work.
<a href="Avicenna%20Prize">The Avicenna Prize for Ethics in Science</a> is awarded every two years by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> and rewards individuals and groups in the field of <a href="ethics%20in%20science">ethics in science</a>. The prize was established in 2003 and named after Avicenna.
The aim of the award is to promote ethical reflection on issues raised by advances in science and technology, and to raise global awareness of the importance of ethics in science.

In March 2008, it was announced that Avicenna's name would be used for new Directories of education institutions for health care professionals, worldwide. The <a href="Avicenna%20Directories">Avicenna Directories</a> will list universities and schools where doctors, public health practitioners, pharmacists and others, are educated. The project team stated "Why Avicenna? Avicenna ... was ... noted for his synthesis of knowledge from both east and west. He has had a lasting influence on the development of medicine and health sciences. The use of Avicenna's name symbolises the worldwide partnership that is needed for the promotion of health services of high quality."
In June 2009 <a href="Iran">Iran</a> donated a "<a href="Persian%20Scholars%20Pavilion">Persian Scholars Pavilion</a>" to <a href="United%20Nations%20Office%20in%20Vienna">United Nations Office in Vienna</a> which is placed in the central <a href="Memorial%20Plaza%20%28Vienna%29">Memorial Plaza</a> of the <a href="Vienna%20International%20Center">Vienna International Center</a>. The "Persian Scholars Pavilion" at United Nations in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Austria">Austria</a> is featuring the statues of four prominent Iranian figures. Highlighting the Iranian architectural features, the pavilion is adorned with Persian art forms and includes the statues of renowned Iranian scientists Avicenna, <a href="Al-Biruni">Al-Biruni</a>, <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Zakariya%20al-Razi">Zakariya Razi</a> (Rhazes) and <a href="Omar%20Khayyam">Omar Khayyam</a>.

The 1982 Soviet film "Youth of Genius" () by recounts Avicenna's younger years. The film is set in Bukhara at the turn of the millennium.

In <a href="Louis%20L%27Amour">Louis L'Amour's</a> 1985 historical novel "<a href="The%20Walking%20Drum">The Walking Drum</a>", Kerbouchard studies and discusses Avicenna's "The Canon of Medicine".

In his book "<a href="The%20Physician">The Physician</a>" (1988) <a href="Noah%20Gordon%20%28novelist%29">Noah Gordon</a> tells the story of a young English medical apprentice who disguises himself as a Jew to travel from England to Persia and learn from Avicenna, the great master of his time. The novel was adapted into a feature film, "<a href="The%20Physician%20%282013%20film%29">The Physician</a>", in 2013. Avicenna was played by <a href="Ben%20Kingsley">Ben Kingsley</a>.

The treatises of Ibn Sīnā influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and music. His works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.
His most famous works are "The Book of Healing", and "The Canon of Medicine".

Ibn Sīnā wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him. His "Logic", "Metaphysics", "Physics", and "De Caelo", are treatises giving a synoptic view of <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian doctrine</a>, though "Metaphysics" demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a> known as Aristotelianism in Ibn Sīnā's world;
Arabic philosophers have hinted at the idea that Ibn Sīnā was attempting to "re-Aristotelianise" Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.

The "Logic" and "Metaphysics" have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836). Two encyclopaedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Healing">Al-Shifa'</a>" ("Sanatio"), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> and elsewhere; part of it on the "De Anima" appeared at Pavia (1490) as the "Liber Sextus Naturalium", and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by <a href="Muhammad%20al-Shahrastani">Muhammad al-Shahrastani</a> seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat ("Liberatio"). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied. There is also a ("hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya", in Latin "Philosophia Orientalis"), mentioned by <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a>, the majority of which is lost in antiquity, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.

This is the list of some of Avicenna's well-known works:

Avicenna's most important <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> work is the "Danishnama-i 'Alai" (, "the Book of Knowledge for [Prince] 'Ala ad-Daulah"). Avicenna created new scientific vocabulary that had not previously existed in Persian. The Danishnama covers such topics as logic, metaphysics, music theory and other sciences of his time. It has been translated into English by Parwiz Morewedge in 1977. The book is also important in respect to Persian scientific works.

"Andar Danesh-e Rag" (, "On the Science of the Pulse") contains nine chapters on the science of the pulse and is a condensed synopsis.

<a href="Persian%20poetry">Persian poetry</a> from Ibn Sina is recorded in various manuscripts and later anthologies such as "<a href="Nozhat%20al-Majales">Nozhat al-Majales</a>".

The Ashes

The Ashes is a <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> series played between <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> and <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a>. The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes, retains the trophy. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, "<a href="The%20Sporting%20Times">The Sporting Times</a>", immediately after Australia's <a href="History%20of%20Test%20cricket%20from%201877%20to%201883%23Australia%20win%20in%20England%201882">1882 victory</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, their first Test win on English soil. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia". The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the <a href="History%20of%20Test%20cricket%20from%201877%20to%201883%23Bligh%20reclaims%20the%20Ashes%201882/3">1882–83 series played in Australia</a>, before which the English captain <a href="Ivo%20Bligh%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Darnley">Ivo Bligh</a> had vowed to "regain those ashes". The English media therefore dubbed the tour "the quest to regain the Ashes".

After England had won two of the three Tests on the tour, a small urn was presented to Bligh by a group of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> women including <a href="Florence%20Bligh%2C%20Countess%20of%20Darnley">Florence Morphy</a>, whom Bligh married within a year. The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden <a href="bail%20%28cricket%29">bail</a>, and were humorously described as "the ashes of Australian cricket". It is not clear whether that "tiny silver urn" is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">MCC</a> by Bligh's widow after his death in 1927.

<a href="The%20Ashes%20urn">The urn</a> has never been the official trophy of the Ashes series, having been a personal gift to Bligh. However, <a href="replica">replica</a>s of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an Ashes series. Since the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201998%E2%80%9399">1998–99 Ashes series</a>, a <a href="Waterford%20Crystal">Waterford Crystal</a> representation of the Ashes urn (called the Ashes Trophy) has been presented to the winners of an Ashes series as the official trophy of that series. Irrespective of which side holds the tournament, the urn remains in the MCC Museum at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>; it has however been taken to Australia to be put on touring display on two occasions: as part of the <a href="Australian%20Bicentenary">Australian Bicentenary</a> celebrations in 1988, and to accompany the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%202006%E2%80%9307">Ashes series in 2006–07</a>.

An Ashes series is traditionally of five Tests, hosted in turn by England and Australia at least once every four years. , England holds the Ashes, having won three of the five Tests in the <a href="2015%20Ashes%20series">2015 Ashes series</a>. Australia and England have won 32 series each and five series have been drawn.

The first <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> between England and Australia was played in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia, <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand%20in%201876%E2%80%9377">in 1877</a>, though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882. On their <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20and%20the%20United%20States%20in%201882">tour of England</a> that year the Australians played just one Test, at <a href="the%20Oval">the Oval</a> in London. It was a low-scoring affair on a difficult <a href="Cricket%20pitch">wicket</a>. Australia made a mere 63 runs in its first <a href="innings">innings</a>, and England, led by <a href="A.%20N.%20Hornby">A. N. Hornby</a>, took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In their second innings, the Australians, boosted by a spectacular 55 runs off 60 deliveries from <a href="Hugh%20Massie">Hugh Massie</a>, managed 122, which left England only 85 runs to win. The Australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second-innings collapse, but fast bowler <a href="Fred%20Spofforth">Fred Spofforth</a>, spurred on by the <a href="gamesmanship">gamesmanship</a> of his opponents, in particular <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a>, refused to give in. "This thing can be done," he declared. Spofforth went on to devastate the English batting, taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave England just eight runs short of victory.

When <a href="Ted%20Peate">Ted Peate</a>, England's last batsman, came to the crease, his side needed just ten runs to win, but Peate managed only two before he was bowled by <a href="Harry%20Boyle%20%28cricketer%29">Harry Boyle</a>. An astonished Oval crowd fell silent, struggling to believe that England could possibly have lost to a colony on home soil. When it finally sank in, the crowd swarmed onto the field, cheering loudly and chairing Boyle and Spofforth to the pavilion.

When Peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner, <a href="Charles%20Studd">Charles Studd</a> (one of the best batsman in England, having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists), to get the runs. Peate humorously replied, "I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best."

The momentous defeat was widely recorded in the British press, which praised the Australians for their plentiful "pluck" and berated the Englishmen for their lack thereof. A celebrated poem appeared in "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" on Saturday, 9 September. The first verse, quoted most frequently, reads:
<poem>
Well done, <a href="wikt%3Acornstalk">Cornstalks</a>! Whipt us
Fair and square,
Was it luck that tript us?
Was it scare?
Kangaroo Land's 'Demon', or our own
Want of 'devil', coolness, nerve, backbone?
</poem>

On 31 August, in the <a href="C.%20W.%20Alcock">Charles Alcock</a>-edited magazine "Cricket: A Weekly Record of The Game", there appeared a mock obituary:

On 2 September a more celebrated mock obituary, written by <a href="Reginald%20Shirley%20Brooks">Reginald Shirley Brooks</a>, appeared in "<a href="The%20Sporting%20Times">The Sporting Times</a>". It read:

<a href="Ivo%20Bligh%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Darnley">Ivo Bligh</a> promised that on <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201882%E2%80%9383">1882–83 tour of Australia</a>, he would, as England's captain, "recover those Ashes". He spoke of them several times over the course of the tour, and the Australian media quickly caught on. The three-match series resulted in a two-one win to England, notwithstanding a fourth match, won by the Australians, whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute.

In the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term "the Ashes" largely disappeared from public use. There is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series, at least not in England. The term became popular again in Australia first, when <a href="George%20Giffen">George Giffen</a>, in his memoirs ("With Bat and Ball", 1899), used the term as if it were well known.

The true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when <a href="Plum%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a> took a team to Australia with the promise that he would regain "the ashes". As had been the case on Bligh's tour 20 years before, the Australian media latched fervently onto the term and, this time, it stuck. Having fulfilled his promise, Warner published a book entitled "How We Recovered the Ashes". Although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text, the title served (along with the general hype created in Australia) to revive public interest in the legend. The first mention of "the Ashes" in <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a> occurs in 1905, while "Wisden"'s first account of the legend is in the 1922 edition.

As it took many years for the name "the Ashes" to be given to ongoing series between England and Australia, there was no concept of there being a representation of the ashes being presented to the winners. As late as 1925 the following verse appeared in "The Cricketers Annual":
<poem>
So here's to Chapman, Hendren and Hobbs,
Gilligan, Woolley and Hearne
May they bring back to the Motherland,
The ashes which have no urn!
</poem>

Nevertheless, several attempts had been made to embody the Ashes in a physical memorial. Examples include one presented to Warner in 1904, another to Australian captain M. A. Noble in 1909, and another to Australian captain W. M. Woodfull in 1934.

The oldest, and the one to enjoy enduring fame, was the one presented to Bligh, later Lord Darnley, during the 1882–83 tour. The precise nature of the origin of <a href="The%20Ashes%20urn">this urn</a> is matter of dispute. Based on a statement by Darnley in 1894, it was believed that a group of <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> ladies, including Darnley's later wife <a href="Florence%20Bligh%2C%20Countess%20of%20Darnley">Florence Morphy</a>, made the presentation after the victory in the Third Test in 1883. More recent researchers, in particular Ronald Willis and Joy Munns have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over Christmas 1882 when the English team were guests of <a href="Sir%20William%20John%20Clarke">Sir William Clarke</a>, at his property "<a href="Rupertswood">Rupertswood</a>", in <a href="Sunbury%2C%20Victoria">Sunbury, Victoria</a>. This was before the matches had started. The prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of Clarke.

In August 1926 Ivo Bligh (now Lord Darnley) displayed the Ashes urn at the "<a href="Morning%20Post">Morning Post</a>" Decorative Art Exhibition held in the Central Hall, Westminster. He made the following statement about how he was given the urn:

A more detailed account of how the Ashes were given to Ivo Bligh was outlined by his wife, the Countess of Darnley, in 1930 during a speech at a cricket luncheon. Her speech was reported by the London Times as follows:

There is another statement which is not totally clear made by Lord Darnley in 1921 about the timing of the presentation of the urn. He was interviewed in his home at Cobham Hall by Montague Grover and the report of this interview was as follows:

He made a similar statement in 1926. The report of this statement in the Brisbane Courier was as follows:

The contents of the urn are also problematic; they were variously reported to be the remains of a stump, bail or the outer casing of a ball, but in 1998 Darnley's 82-year-old daughter-in-law said they were the remains of her mother-in-law's veil, casting a further layer of doubt on the matter. However, during the tour of Australia in 2006/7, the MCC official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted, and it was now "95% certain" that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail. Speaking on Channel Nine TV on 25 November 2006, he said x-rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked, and repair work had to be carried out. The urn is made of <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a> and is about tall and may originally have been a perfume jar.
A label containing a six-line verse is pasted on the urn. This is the fourth verse of a song-lyric published in the "<a href="Melbourne%20Punch">Melbourne Punch</a>" on 1 February 1883:
<poem>
When <a href="Ivo%20Bligh%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Darnley">Ivo</a> goes back with the urn, the urn;
<a href="Studd%20brothers">Studds</a>, <a href="A%20G%20Steel">Steel</a>, <a href="Walter%20Read">Read</a> and <a href="Edward%20Tylecote">Tylecote</a> return, return;
The <a href="wikt%3Amake%20the%20welkin%20ring">welkin</a> will ring loud,
The great crowd will feel proud,
Seeing <a href="Dick%20Barlow">Barlow</a> and <a href="Billy%20Bates">Bates</a> with the urn, the urn;
And the rest coming home with the urn.
</poem>

In February 1883, just before the disputed Fourth Test, a velvet bag made by Mrs Ann Fletcher, the daughter of Joseph Hines Clarke and Marion Wright, both of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, was given to Bligh to contain the urn.

During Darnley's lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn, and no record of a published photograph exists before 1921. "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" published this photo in January 1921 (shown above).

When Darnley died in 1927 his widow presented the urn to the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes. MCC first displayed the urn in the Long Room at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> and since 1953 in the MCC Cricket Museum at the ground. MCC's wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy.

It is in fact a private memento, and for this reason it is never awarded to either England or Australia, but is kept permanently in the MCC Cricket Museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match.

Because the urn itself is so delicate, it has been allowed to travel to Australia only twice. The first occasion was in 1988 for a museum tour as part of the <a href="Australian%20Bicentenary">Australian Bicentenary</a> celebrations; the second was for the 2006/7 Ashes series. The urn arrived on 17 October 2006, going on display at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Sydney">Museum of Sydney</a>. It then toured to other states, with the final appearance at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery on 21 January 2007.

In the 1990s, given Australia's long dominance of the Ashes and the popular acceptance of the Darnley urn as "the Ashes", the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series. As its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the MCC Cricket Museum, the MCC would not agree. Furthermore, in 2002, Bligh's great-great-grandson Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the <a href="Earl%20of%20Darnley">Earldom of Darnley</a>, argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the MCC only for safe keeping.

As a compromise, the MCC commissioned a trophy in the form of a larger replica of the urn in <a href="Waterford%20Crystal">Waterford Crystal</a>, to award to the winning team of each series from 1998–99. This is known as the Ashes Trophy. This did little to diminish the status of the Darnley urn as the most important icon in cricket, the symbol of this old and keenly fought contest.

Later in 1882, following the famous Australian victory at The Oval, <a href="Ivo%20Bligh%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Darnley">Bligh</a> led an England team to Australia, as he said, to "recover those ashes". Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the First Test by <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29">nine wickets</a>, but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the Third Test, England were generally considered to have "won back the Ashes" 2–1. A fourth match was played, against a "United Australian XI", which was arguably stronger than the Australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches; this game, however, is not generally considered part of the 1882–83 series. It "is" counted as a Test, but as a standalone. This match ended in a victory for Australia.

After Bligh's victory, there was an extended period of English dominance. The tours generally had fewer Tests in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years, the first five-Test series taking place only in 1894–95. England lost only four Ashes Tests in the 1880s out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested.

There was more chopping and changing in the teams, given that there was no official board of selectors for each country (in 1887–88, two separate English teams were on tour in Australia) and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking their first series win since 1882 with a 2–1 victory in 1891–92. But England dominated, winning the next three series to 1896 despite continuing player disputes.

The <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201894-95">1894–95</a> series began in sensational fashion when England won the First Test at Sydney by just 10 runs having followed on. Australia had scored a massive 586 (<a href="Syd%20Gregory">Syd Gregory</a> 201, <a href="George%20Giffen">George Giffen</a> 161) and then dismissed England for 325. But England responded with 437 and then dramatically dismissed Australia for 166 with <a href="Bobby%20Peel">Bobby Peel</a> taking 6 for 67. At the close of the second last day's play, Australia were 113–2, needing only 64 more runs. But heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left-arm bowlers, Peel and <a href="Johnny%20Briggs%20%28cricketer%29">Johnny Briggs</a>, were all but unplayable. England went on to win the series 3–2 after it had been all square before the Final Test, which England won by 6 wickets. The English heroes were Peel, with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 26.70, and <a href="Tom%20Richardson%20%28cricketer%29">Tom Richardson</a>, with 32 at 26.53.

In 1896 England under the captaincy of <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a> won the series 2–1, and this marked the end of England's longest period of Ashes dominance.

Australia resoundingly won the 1897–98 series by 4–1 under the captaincy of <a href="Harry%20Trott">Harry Trott</a>. His successor <a href="Joe%20Darling">Joe Darling</a> won the next three series in 1899, 1901–02 and the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201902">classic 1902 series</a>, which became one of the most famous in the history of Test cricket.

Five matches were played in 1902 but the first two were drawn after being hit by bad weather. In the First Test (the first played at <a href="Edgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground">Edgbaston</a>), after scoring 376 England bowled out Australia for 36 (<a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a> 7/17) and reduced them to 46–2 when they followed on. Australia won the Third and Fourth Tests at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a> and <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a> respectively. At Old Trafford, Australia won by just 3 runs after <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> had scored 104 on a "bad wicket", reaching his hundred before lunch on the first day. England won the last Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> by one wicket. Chasing 263 to win, they slumped to 48–5 before <a href="Gilbert%20Jessop">Jessop's</a> 104 gave them a chance. He reached his hundred in just 75 minutes. The last-wicket pair of <a href="George%20Herbert%20Hirst">George Hirst</a> and Rhodes were required to score 15 runs for victory. When Rhodes joined him, Hirst reportedly said: "We'll get them in singles, Wilfred." In fact, they scored thirteen singles and a two.

The period of Darling's captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding Australian players such as Trumper, <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a>, <a href="James%20Kelly%20%28cricketer%29">James Kelly</a>, <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a>, <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a>, <a href="Hugh%20Trumble">Hugh Trumble</a> and <a href="Ernie%20Jones%20%28Australian%20sportsman%29">Ernie Jones</a>.

After what the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">MCC</a> saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided to take control of organising tours themselves, and this led to the first MCC tour of Australia in 1903–04. England won it against the odds, and <a href="Plum%20Warner">Plum Warner</a>, the England captain, wrote up his version of the tour in his book "How We Recovered The Ashes". The title of this book revived the Ashes legend and it was after this that England v Australia series were customarily referred to as "The Ashes".

England and Australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Five more series took place between 1905 and 1912. In 1905 England's captain <a href="Stanley%20Jackson">Stanley Jackson</a> not only won the series 2–0, but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages. Monty Noble led Australia to victory in both 1907–08 and 1909. Then England won in 1911–12 by four matches to one. <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> establishing himself as England's first-choice opening batsman with three centuries, while <a href="Frank%20Foster%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Foster</a> (32 wickets at 21.62) and <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a> (34 wickets at 22.88) formed a formidable bowling partnership.

England retained the Ashes when they won the <a href="1912%20Triangular%20Tournament">1912 Triangular Tournament</a>, which also featured <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a>. The Australian touring party had been severely weakened by a <a href="Big%20Six%20cricket%20dispute%20of%201912">dispute</a> between the board and players that caused <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a>, <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>, Warwick Armstrong, <a href="Tibby%20Cotter">Tibby Cotter</a>, <a href="Sammy%20Carter">Sammy Carter</a> and <a href="Vernon%20Ransford">Vernon Ransford</a> to be omitted.

After the war, Australia took firm control of both the Ashes and world cricket. For the first time, the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as <a href="Jack%20Gregory%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Gregory</a> and <a href="Ted%20McDonald">Ted McDonald</a> crippled the English batting on a regular basis. Australia recorded overwhelming victories both in England and on home soil. They won the first eight matches in succession including a 5–0 <a href="whitewash%20%28sport%29">whitewash</a> in <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201920-21">1920–1921</a> at the hands of Warwick Armstrong's team.

The ruthless and belligerent Armstrong led his team back to England in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of England without defeat.
England won only one Test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925.

In a rain-hit series in 1926, England managed to eke out a 1–0 victory with a win in the final Test at The Oval. Because the series was at stake, the match was to be "timeless", i.e., played to a finish. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22. Jack Hobbs and <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a> took the score to 49–0 at the end of the second day, a lead of 27. Heavy rain fell overnight, and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket. England seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match. In spite of the very difficult batting conditions, however, Hobbs and Sutcliffe took their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and England won the game comfortably. Australian captain <a href="Herbie%20Collins">Herbie Collins</a> was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level, and some accused him of throwing the match.

Australia's ageing post-war team broke up after 1926, with Collins, <a href="Charlie%20Macartney">Charlie Macartney</a> and <a href="Warren%20Bardsley">Warren Bardsley</a> all departing, and Gregory breaking down at the start of the 1928–29 series.

Despite the debut of <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, the inexperienced Australians, led by <a href="Jack%20Ryder%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Ryder</a>, were heavily defeated, losing 4–1. England had a very strong batting side, with <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a> contributing 905 runs at an average of 113.12, and Hobbs, Sutcliffe and <a href="Patsy%20Hendren">Patsy Hendren</a> all scoring heavily; the bowling was more than adequate, without being outstanding.

In 1930, <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> led an extremely inexperienced team to England.

Bradman fulfilled his promise in the 1930 series when he scored 974 runs at 139.14, which remains a world record Test series aggregate. A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying "I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia." In the <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> Test, he made 334, reaching 309* at the end of the first day, including a century before lunch. Bradman himself thought that his 254 in the preceding match, at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, was a better innings. England managed to stay in contention until the deciding final Test at The Oval, but yet another double hundred by Bradman, and 7/92 by <a href="Percy%20Hornibrook">Percy Hornibrook</a> in England's second innings, enabled Australia to win by an innings and take the series 2–1. <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a>'s 29 wickets at 31.89 for Australia in this high-scoring series were also important.

Australia had one of the strongest batting line-ups ever in the early 1930s, with Bradman, <a href="Archie%20Jackson">Archie Jackson</a>, <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>, <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> and <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a>. It was the prospect of bowling at this line-up that caused England's 1932–33 captain <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a> to adopt the tactic of fast <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>, better known as <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>.

Jardine instructed his <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowlers</a>, most notably <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> and <a href="Bill%20Voce">Bill Voce</a>, to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen, with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, thus providing easy catches to a stacked <a href="leg%20side">leg-side</a> field. Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it "leg theory" but it was widely disparaged by its opponents, who dubbed it "Bodyline" (from "on the line of the body"). Although England decisively won the Ashes 4–1, Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">MCC</a> eventually changed the <a href="Laws%20of%20cricket">Laws of cricket</a> to curtail the number of leg side fielders.

Jardine's comment was: "I've not travelled 6,000 miles to make friends. I'm here to win the Ashes".

Some of the Australians wanted to use Bodyline in retaliation, but Woodfull flatly refused. He famously told England manager <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, "There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket; the other is making no attempt to do so" after the latter had come into the Australian rooms to express sympathy for a Larwood bouncer had struck the Australian skipper in the heart and felled him.

On the batting-friendly <a href="cricket%20pitch">wickets</a> that prevailed in the late 1930s, most Tests up to the Second World War still gave results. It should be borne in mind that Tests in Australia prior to the war were all played to a finish. Many batting records were set in this period.

The 1934 Ashes series began with the notable absence of Larwood, Voce and Jardine. The MCC had made it clear, in light of the revelations of the bodyline series, that these players would not face Australia. It should be noted that the MCC, although it had earlier condoned and encouraged bodyline tactics in the 1932–33 series, laid the blame on Larwood when relations turned sour. Larwood was forced by the MCC to either apologise or be removed from the Test side. He went for the latter.

Australia recovered the Ashes in 1934 and held them until 1953, though no Test cricket was played during the Second World War.

As in 1930, the 1934 series was decided in the final Test at The Oval. Australia, batting first, posted a massive 701 in the first innings. Bradman (244) and Ponsford (266) were in record-breaking form with a partnership of 451 for the second wicket. England eventually faced a massive 707-run target for victory and failed, Australia winning the series 2–1. This made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes and he retired upon his return to Australia.

In 1936–37 Bradman succeeded Woodfull as Australian captain. He started badly, losing the first two Tests heavily after Australia were caught on <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a>s. However, the Australians fought back and Bradman won his first series in charge 3–2.

The 1938 series was a high-scoring affair with two high-scoring draws, resulting in a 1–1 result, Australia retaining the Ashes. After the first two matches ended in stalemate and the Third Test at Old Trafford never started due to rain. Australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low-scoring match at Headingley to retain the urn. In the timeless Fifth Test at The Oval, the highlight was <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>'s then world-record score of 364 as England made 903-7 declared. Bradman and <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> injured themselves during Hutton's marathon effort, and with only nine men, Australia fell to defeat by an innings and 579 runs, the heaviest in Test history.

The Ashes resumed after the war when England toured in 1946–47 and, as in 1920–21, found that Australia had made the better post-war recovery. Still captained by Bradman and now featuring the potent new-ball partnership of <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> and <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>, Australia were convincing 3–0 winners.

Aged 38 and having been unwell during the war, Bradman had been reluctant to play. He batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to <a href="Jack%20Ikin">Jack Ikin</a>; England believed it was a catch, but Bradman stood his ground, believing it to be a bump ball. The umpire ruled in the Australian captain's favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear, scoring 187. Australia promptly seized the initiative, won the First Test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post-war era. The controversy over the Ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era.

In 1948 Australia set new standards, completely outplaying their hosts to win 4–0 with one draw. This <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian team</a>, led by Bradman, who turned 40 during his final tour of England, has gone down in history as "The Invincibles". Playing 34 matches on tour—three of which were not first-class—and including the five Tests, they remained unbeaten, winning 27 and drawing 7.

Bradman's men were greeted by packed crowds across the country, and records for Test attendances in England were set in the <a href="Second%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Second</a> and <a href="Fourth%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Fourth Tests</a> at Lord's and Headingley respectively. Before a record attendance of spectators at Headingley, Australia set a world record by chasing down 404 on the last day for a seven-wicket victory.

The 1948 series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history, as Bradman played his final innings for Australia in the <a href="Fifth%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Fifth Test</a> at The Oval, needing to score only four runs to end with a career <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of exactly 100. However, Bradman made a second-ball duck, bowled by an <a href="Eric%20Hollies">Eric Hollies</a> googly that sent him into retirement with a career average of 99.94.

Bradman was succeeded as Australian captain by <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>, who led the team to a 4–1 series victory in 1950–51. The series was not as one-sided as the number of wins suggest, with several tight matches.

The tide finally turned in 1953 when England won the final Test at The Oval to take the series 1–0, having narrowly avoided defeat in the preceding Test at Headingley. This was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in English cricket history with players such as captain Len Hutton, batsmen <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>, <a href="Peter%20May%20%28cricketer%29">Peter May</a>, <a href="Tom%20Graveney">Tom Graveney</a>, <a href="Colin%20Cowdrey">Colin Cowdrey</a>, bowlers <a href="Fred%20Trueman">Fred Trueman</a>, <a href="Brian%20Statham">Brian Statham</a>, <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a>, <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a>, <a href="Tony%20Lock">Tony Lock</a>, wicket-keeper <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a> and all-rounder <a href="Trevor%20Bailey">Trevor Bailey</a>.

In <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201954-55">1954–55</a>, Australia's batsmen had no answer to the pace of <a href="Frank%20Tyson">Frank Tyson</a> and Statham. After winning the First Test by an innings after being controversially sent in by Hutton, Australia lost its way and England took a hat-trick of victories to win the series 3–1.

A dramatic series in 1956 saw a record that will probably never be beaten: off-spinner <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a>'s monumental effort at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a> when he bowled 68 of 191 overs to take 19 out of 20 possible Australian wickets in the Fourth Test. It was Australia's second consecutive innings defeat in a wet summer, and the hosts were in strong positions in the two drawn Tests, in which half the playing time was washed out. Bradman rated the team that won the series 2–1 as England's best ever.

England's dominance was not to last. Australia won 4–0 in 1958–59, having found a high-quality spinner of their own in new skipper <a href="Richie%20Benaud">Richie Benaud</a>, who took 31 wickets in the five-Test series, and paceman <a href="Alan%20Keith%20Davidson">Alan Davidson</a>, who took 24 wickets at 19.00. The series was overshadowed by the furore over various Australian bowlers, most notably <a href="Ian%20Meckiff">Ian Meckiff</a>, whom the English management and media accused of <a href="throwing%20%28cricket%29">illegally throwing</a> Australia to victory.

Australia consolidated their status as the leading team in world cricket with a hard-fought 2–1 away series. After narrowly winning the Second Test at Lord's, dubbed "The Battle of the Ridge" because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce, Australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford and sealed the series after a heavy collapse during the English runchase.

The tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s, held in 1962–63, 1964, 1965–66 and 1968. The powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement, and their replacements were of lesser quality, making it more difficult to force a result. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing. Of the 20 Tests played during the four series, Australia won four and England three. As they held the Ashes, Australian captains <a href="Bob%20Simpson%20%28cricketer%29">Bob Simpson</a> and <a href="Bill%20Lawry">Bill Lawry</a> were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. During this period, spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased, but Simpson and Lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction.

It was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. West Indies defeated England twice in the mid-1960s and South Africa, in two series before they were banned for <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>, completely outplayed Australia 3–1 and 4–0. Australia had lost 2–1 during a tour of the West Indies in 1964–65, the first time they had lost a series to any team other than England.

In 1970–71, <a href="Ray%20Illingworth">Ray Illingworth</a> led England to a 2–0 win in Australia, mainly due to <a href="John%20Snow%20%28cricketer%29">John Snow</a>'s fast bowling, and the prolific batting of <a href="Geoffrey%20Boycott">Geoffrey Boycott</a> and <a href="John%20Edrich">John Edrich</a>. It was not until the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England's success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia's lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio.

The 1972 series finished 2–2, with England under Illingworth retaining the Ashes.

In the 1974–75 series, with the England team breaking up and their best batsman Geoff Boycott refusing to play, Australian pace bowlers <a href="Jeff%20Thomson">Jeff Thomson</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Lillee">Dennis Lillee</a> wreaked havoc. A 4–1 result was a fair reflection as England were left shell shocked. England then lost the 1975 series 0–1, but at least restored some pride under new captain <a href="Tony%20Greig">Tony Greig</a>.

Australia won the 1977 Centenary Test which was not an Ashes contest, but then a storm broke as <a href="Kerry%20Packer">Kerry Packer</a> announced his intention to form <a href="World%20Series%20Cricket">World Series Cricket</a>. WSC affected all Test-playing nations but it weakened Australia especially as the bulk of its players had signed up with Packer; the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) would not select WSC-contracted players and an almost completely new Test team had to be formed. WSC came after an era during which the duopoly of Australian and English dominance dissipated; the Ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the West Indies in the late 1970s challenged that view. The West Indies would go on to record resounding Test series wins over Australia and England and dominated world cricket until the 1990s.

With Greig having joined WSC, England appointed <a href="Mike%20Brearley">Mike Brearley</a> as their captain and he enjoyed great success against Australia. Largely assisted by the return of Boycott, Brearley's men won the 1977 series 3–0 and then completed an overwhelming 5–1 series win against an Australian side missing its WSC players in 1978–79. <a href="Allan%20Border">Allan Border</a> made his Test debut for Australia in 1978–79.

Brearley retired from Test cricket in 1979 and was succeeded by <a href="Ian%20Botham">Ian Botham</a>, who started the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201981">1981 series</a> as England captain, by which time the WSC split had ended. After Australia took a 1–0 lead in the first two Tests, Botham was forced to resign or was sacked (depending on the source). Brearley surprisingly agreed to be reappointed before the Third Test at Headingley. This was a remarkable match in which Australia looked certain to take a 2–0 series lead after they had forced England to follow-on 227 runs behind. England, despite being 135 for 7, produced a second innings total of 356, Botham scoring 149*. Chasing just 130, Australia were sensationally dismissed for 111, <a href="Bob%20Willis">Bob Willis</a> taking 8–43. It was the first time since 1894–95 that a team following on had won a Test match. Under Brearley's leadership, England went on to win the next two matches before a drawn final match at The Oval.

In 1982–83 Australia had <a href="Greg%20Chappell">Greg Chappell</a> back from WSC as captain, while the England team was weakened by the enforced omission of their <a href="South%20African%20rebel%20tours">South African tour rebels</a>, particularly <a href="Graham%20Gooch">Graham Gooch</a> and <a href="John%20Emburey">John Emburey</a>. Australia went 2–0 up after three Tests, but England won the Fourth Test by 3 runs (after a 70-run last wicket stand) to set up the final decider, which was drawn.

In 1985 <a href="David%20Gower">David Gower</a>'s England team was strengthened by the return of Gooch and Emburey as well as the emergence at international level of <a href="Tim%20Robinson%20%28cricketer%29">Tim Robinson</a> and <a href="Mike%20Gatting">Mike Gatting</a>. Australia, now captained by <a href="Allan%20Border">Allan Border</a>, had themselves been weakened by a rebel South African tour, the loss of <a href="Terry%20Alderman">Terry Alderman</a> being a particular factor. England won 3–1.

Despite suffering heavy defeats against the West Indies during the 1980s, England continued to do well in the Ashes. Mike Gatting was the captain in 1986–87 but his team started badly and attracted some criticism. Then <a href="Chris%20Broad">Chris Broad</a> scored three hundreds in successive Tests and bowling successes from <a href="Graham%20Dilley">Graham Dilley</a> and <a href="Gladstone%20Small">Gladstone Small</a> meant England won the series 2–1.

The Australian team of 1989 was comparable to the great Australian teams of the past, and resoundingly defeated England 4–0. Well led by <a href="Allan%20Border">Allan Border</a>, the team included the young cricketers <a href="Mark%20Taylor%20%28cricketer%29">Mark Taylor</a>, <a href="Merv%20Hughes">Merv Hughes</a>, <a href="David%20Boon">David Boon</a>, <a href="Ian%20Healy">Ian Healy</a> and <a href="Steve%20Waugh">Steve Waugh</a>, who were all to prove long-serving and successful Ashes competitors. England, now led once again by <a href="David%20Gower">David Gower</a>, suffered from injuries and poor form. During the Fourth Test news broke that prominent England players had agreed to take part in a "rebel tour" of South Africa the following winter; three of them (<a href="Tim%20Robinson%20%28cricketer%29">Tim Robinson</a>, <a href="Neil%20Foster">Neil Foster</a> and <a href="John%20Emburey">John Emburey</a>) were playing in the match, and were subsequently dropped from the England side.

Australia reached a cricketing peak in the 1990s and early 2000s, coupled with a general decline in England's fortunes. After re-establishing its credibility in 1989, Australia underlined its superiority with victories in the 1990–91, 1993, 1994–95, 1997, 1998–99, 2001 and 2002–03 series, all by convincing margins.

Great Australian players in the early years included batsmen Border, Boon, Taylor and Steve Waugh. The captaincy passed from Border to Taylor in the mid-1990s and then to Steve Waugh before the 2001 series. In the latter part of the 1990s Waugh himself, along with his twin brother <a href="Mark%20Waugh">Mark</a>, scored heavily for Australia and fast bowlers <a href="Glenn%20McGrath">Glenn McGrath</a> and <a href="Jason%20Gillespie">Jason Gillespie</a> made a serious impact, especially the former. The wicketkeeper-batsman position was held by <a href="Ian%20Healy">Ian Healy</a> for most of the 1990s and by <a href="Adam%20Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> from 2001 to 2006–07. In the 2000s, batsmen <a href="Justin%20Langer">Justin Langer</a>, <a href="Damien%20Martyn">Damien Martyn</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Hayden">Matthew Hayden</a> became noted players for Australia. But the most dominant Australian player was leg-spinner <a href="Shane%20Warne">Shane Warne</a>, whose first delivery in Ashes cricket in 1993, to dismiss Mike Gatting, became known as the <a href="Ball%20of%20the%20Century">Ball of the Century</a>.

Australia's record between 1989 and 2005 had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides. Before the 1989 series began, the win-loss ratio was almost even, with 87 test wins for Australia to England's 86, 74 tests having been drawn. By the 2005 series Australia's test wins had increased to 115 whereas England's had increased to only 93 (with 82 draws). In the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series, the two sides had played 43 times; Australia winning 28 times, England 7 times, with 8 draws. Only a single England victory had come in a match in which the Ashes were still at stake, namely the First Test of the 1997 series. All others were consolation victories when the Ashes had been secured by Australia.

England were undefeated in Test matches through the 2004 calendar year. This elevated them to second in the <a href="ICC%20Test%20Championship">ICC Test Championship</a>. Hopes that the <a href="2005%20Ashes%20series">2005 Ashes series</a> would be closely fought proved well-founded, the series remaining undecided as the closing session of the final Test began. Experienced journalists including Richie Benaud rated the series as the most exciting in living memory. It has been compared with the great series of the distant past, such as 1894–95 and 1902.

The First Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> was convincingly won by Australia, but in the remaining four matches the teams were evenly matched and England fought back to win the Second Test by 2 runs, the smallest winning margin in Ashes history, and the second-smallest in all Tests. The rain-affected Third Test ended with the last two Australian batsmen holding out for a draw; and England won the Fourth Test by three wickets after forcing Australia to <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a> for the first time in 191 Tests being a period of 17 years. A draw in the final Test gave England victory in an Ashes series for the first time in 18 years and their first Ashes victory at home since 1985.

Australia regained the Ashes on their home turf in the <a href="2006-07%20Ashes%20series">2006–07 series</a> with a convincing 5–0 victory, only the second time an Ashes series has been won by that margin. <a href="Glenn%20McGrath">Glenn McGrath</a>, <a href="Shane%20Warne">Shane Warne</a> and <a href="Justin%20Langer">Justin Langer</a> retired from Test cricket after that series, while <a href="Damien%20Martyn">Damien Martyn</a> retired during the series.

The <a href="2009%20Ashes%20series">2009 series</a> began with a tense draw in the First Test at <a href="SWALEC%20Stadium">SWALEC Stadium</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, with England's last-wicket batsmen <a href="James%20Anderson%20%28cricketer%29">James Anderson</a> and <a href="Monty%20Panesar">Monty Panesar</a> surviving 69 balls. England then achieved its first Ashes win at Lord's since 1934 to go 1–0 up. After a rain-affected draw at Edgbaston, the fourth match at Headingley was convincingly won by Australia by an innings and 80 runs to level the series. Finally, England won the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> by a margin of 197 runs to regain the Ashes. <a href="Andrew%20Flintoff">Andrew Flintoff</a> retired from Test cricket soon afterwards.

The <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Ashes%20series">2010–11 series</a> was played in Australia. The First Test at Brisbane ended in a draw, but England won the Second Test, at Adelaide, by an innings and 71 runs. Australia came back with a victory at Perth in the Third Test. In the Fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, England batting second scored 513 to defeat Australia (98 and 258) by an innings and 157 runs. This gave England an unbeatable 2–1 lead in the series and so they retained the Ashes. England went on to win the series 3–1, beating Australia by an innings and 83 runs at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia, captained by Michael Clarke, batted first on a cloudy day after winning the toss and were bowled out for 280. England made 644, their highest innings total since 1938. England then bowled Australia out again for 281. England's series victory was its first on Australian soil for 24 years. The 2010–11 Ashes series was the only one in which a team had won three Tests by innings margins and it was the first time England had scored 500 or more four times in a single series.

Australia's build-up to the <a href="2013%20Ashes%20series">2013 Ashes series</a> was far from ideal. <a href="Darren%20Lehmann">Darren Lehmann</a> took over as coach from <a href="Mickey%20Arthur">Mickey Arthur</a> following a string of poor results. A batting line-up weakened by the previous year's retirements of former captain <a href="Ricky%20Ponting">Ricky Ponting</a> and <a href="Mike%20Hussey">Mike Hussey</a>, was also shorn of opener <a href="David%20Warner%20%28cricketer%29">David Warner</a>, who was suspended for the start of the series following an off-field incident. The tourists put those issues behind them to bowl England out for 215 after losing the toss in the First Test at Trent Bridge. In the face of high-class swing bowling from <a href="James%20Anderson%20%28cricketer%29">James Anderson</a>, who ended with 10 wickets in the match, Australia collapsed to 117–9. However, debutant 19-year-old <a href="Ashton%20Agar">Ashton Agar</a> made a world-record 98 for a number 11 and <a href="Phillip%20Hughes">Phil Hughes</a> an unbeaten 81 to secure an unlikely lead of 65. England's second-innings total of 375 set Australia a target of 311, against which they fell short by only 14 runs in a tense finish. In the Second Test, England beat Australia by 347 runs in a very one-sided contest. In the Third Test, held at a newly refurbished Old Trafford, Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. They amassed a commanding score of 527–7, led by captain Michael Clarke's 187. The pressure was then on the home side to avoid the follow-on. England scored 368 with a century for Kevin Pietersen. Australia's second innings score was 172–7 at the end of Day 4, characterised by batting order changes to achieve a fast run rate to allow enough time to bowl England out amid inclement weather forecasts. Australia declared overnight to post England a target of 332 to win. Contrary to expectations, play resumed with only a minor delay on Day 5, and with captain Alastair Cook being bowled out for 0 (his first duck in 26 innings as captain), Australia looked to be in with a significant chance of a win, keeping their series hopes alive. By lunch England were 37–3, but on resumption of play only 3 balls were bowled before rain stopped play. This rain persisted and, at 16:40, the captains shook hands and the match was declared a draw. With England 2–0 up with two tests to play, England retained the Ashes on 5 August 2013.

In the Fourth Test, England won the toss and batted first, putting on 238 runs, Australia took a narrow lead scoring 270 in their first innings. In the second innings England scored 330, Ian Bell top-scoring with 113. Needing only 298 runs to win Australia was in a strong position at 138/2, only 160 short with eight wickets in hand. Following a rain delay, Australia crashed to a 74-run defeat, losing all eight wickets for only 86 runs. England had taken 9 wickets in the final session of the fourth day. Stuart Broad was England's top wicket-taker in the match with 11 wickets. England held a 3–0 lead going into the final Fifth Test at The Oval.

The final Test was drawn. On the fourth day no play was possible due to rain, but on the final day after an aggressive Australian declaration, England came close to achieving its first 4–0 victory in an Ashes series. Play was abandoned, owing to bad light, denying a thrilling finish to the large crowd of spectators. There was media criticism of the new ICC rules requiring umpires to stop play when failing light was measured at a specified level.
In the second of two Ashes series held in 2013 (the series ended in 2014), this time hosted by Australia, the home team won the series five test matches to nil. This was the third time Australia has completed a clean sweep (or "whitewash") in Ashes history, a feat never matched by England. All six specialist Australian batsmen scored more runs than any Englishman with 10 centuries between them, with only debutant Ben Stokes scoring a century for England. Mitchell Johnson took 37 English wickets at 13.97 and Ryan Harris 22 wickets at 19.31 in the 5-Test series . Only Stuart Broad and all-rounder Stokes bowled effectively for England, with their spinner Graeme Swann retiring due to a chronic elbow injury after the decisive Third Test.

Australia came into the next Ashes series in England as favourites to retain the Ashes. Although England won the first Test in Cardiff, Australia won comfortably in the second Test at Lords. In the next two Tests, the Australian batsmen struggled, being bowled out for 136 in the first innings at <a href="Edgbaston">Edgbaston</a> , with England proceeding to win by eight wickets. This was followed by Australia being bowled out for 60 as <a href="Stuart%20Broad">Stuart Broad</a> took fastest five wickets and finished the spell with 8 for 15 in the first innings at Trent Bridge, the quickest - in terms of balls faced - a team has been bowled out in the first innings of a Test match. With victory by an innings and 78 runs on the morning of the third day of the Fourth Test, England regained the Ashes.

Australia will host the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Ashes%20series">2017–18 Ashes series</a> with the second test at <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a> being the first <a href="day/night">day/night</a> Ashes Test.

A team must win a series to gain the right to hold the Ashes. A drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the Ashes.

Ashes series have generally been played over five Test matches, although there have been four-match series (1938; 1975) and six-match series (1970–71; 1974–75; 1978–79; 1981; 1985; 1989; 1993 and 1997).

69 series have been played, with Australia winning 32 and England 32. The remaining five series were drawn. , the win–loss ratio in Ashes Tests (from 1882) stands at 130 wins for Australia to 106 wins for England, with 89 draws.

In the 132 years since 1883, Australia have held the Ashes for approximately 78.5 years, and England for 53.5 years.

Australians have made 264 <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">centuries</a> in Ashes Tests, of which 23 have been scores over 200, while Englishmen have scored 212 centuries, of which 10 have been over 200. Australians have taken 10 <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s in a match on 41 occasions, Englishmen 38 times.

Series results, up to and including the 2015 Ashes series:
The series alternates between the United Kingdom and Australia, and within each country each of the usually five matches is held at a different <a href="List%20of%20Test%20cricket%20grounds">cricket ground</a>.

In <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the grounds currently used are <a href="the%20Gabba">the Gabba</a> in Brisbane (first staged an England–Australia Test in the 1932–33 season), <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a> (1884–85), <a href="WACA%20Ground">the WACA</a> in Perth (1970–71), the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> (MCG) (1876–77), and the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> (SCG) (1881–82). A single Test was held at the <a href="Brisbane%20Exhibition%20Ground">Brisbane Exhibition Ground</a> in 1928–29. Traditionally, Melbourne hosts the <a href="Boxing%20Day%20Test">Boxing Day Test</a> and Sydney hosts the New Year Test. Cricket Australia proposed that the 2010–11 series consist of six Tests, with the additional game to be played at <a href="Bellerive%20Oval">Bellerive Oval</a> in Hobart. The England and Wales Cricket Board declined and the series was played over five Tests.

In <a href="England">England</a> and <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, the grounds used are: <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> in Manchester (1884), <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> in <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a>, <a href="South%20London">South London</a> (1884); <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>, <a href="North%20London">North London</a> (1884); <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a> at <a href="West%20Bridgford">West Bridgford</a>, Nottinghamshire (1899), <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> (1899); <a href="Edgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground">Edgbaston</a> in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> (1902); <a href="SWALEC%20Stadium">Sophia Gardens</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a> (2009); and the <a href="Riverside%20Ground">Riverside Ground</a> in <a href="Chester-le-Street">Chester-le-Street</a>, County Durham (2013); <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Rose Bowl</a> will host it in 2023. One Test was held at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a> in <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> in 1902. Traditionally the final Test of the series is played at the Oval.

The popularity and reputation of the cricket series has led to other sports or games, and/or their followers, using the name "Ashes" for contests between England and Australia. The best-known and longest-running of these events is the <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> rivalry between <a href="Great%20Britain%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">Great Britain</a> and <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">Australia</a> (see <a href="The%20Ashes%20%28rugby%20league%29">rugby league "Ashes"</a>). Use of the name "Ashes" was suggested by the Australian team when rugby league matches between the two countries commenced in 1908. Other examples included the television game shows "<a href="Gladiators%20%28TV%20series%29">Gladiators</a>" and "<a href="Sale%20of%20the%20Century%20%28Australian%20game%20show%29">Sale of the Century</a>", both of which broadcast special editions containing contestants from the Australian and English versions of the shows competing against each other.

The term became further genericised in Australia in the first half of the twentieth century, and was used to describe many sports rivalries or competitions outside the context of Australia vs England. The <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a> <a href="Interstate%20matches%20in%20Australian%20rules%20football">interstate carnival</a>, and the small silver casket which served as its trophy, were symbolically known as "the Ashes" of Australian football, and was spoken of as such until at least the 1940s. The soccer rivalry between Australia and New Zealand was described as "the soccer ashes of Australasia" until as late as the 1950s; ashes from cigars smoked by the two countries' captains were put into a casket in 1923 to make the trophy literal. The interstate <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> <a href="State%20of%20Origin%20series%23Interstate%20Rugby%20League%20prior%20to%201980">rivalry between Queensland and New South Wales</a> was known for a time as Australia's rugby league ashes, and <a href="lawn%20bowls">bowls</a> competitions between the two states also regularly used the term. Even some local rivalries, such as southern Western Australia's annual Great Southern Football Carnival, were locally described as "the ashes". This genericised usage is no longer common, and "the Ashes" would today be assumed only to apply to a contest between Australia and England.

The Ashes featured in the film "<a href="The%20Final%20Test">The Final Test</a>", released in 1953, based on a television play by <a href="Terence%20Rattigan">Terence Rattigan</a>. It stars <a href="Jack%20Warner%20%28actor%29">Jack Warner</a> as an England cricketer playing the last Test of his career, which is the last of an Ashes series; the film includes cameo appearances of English captain <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and other players who were part of England's 1953 triumph.

<a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a>'s 1982 science fiction comedy novel "<a href="Life%2C%20the%20Universe%20and%20Everything">Life, the Universe and Everything</a>" – the third part of "<a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>" series – features the urn containing the Ashes as a significant element of its plot. The urn is stolen by alien robots, as the burnt stump inside is part of a key needed to unlock the "Wikkit Gate" and release an imprisoned world called Krikkit.

Analysis

Analysis is the process of breaking a <a href="complexity">complex topic</a> or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="logic">logic</a> since before <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384–322 <a href="Before%20Christ">B.C.</a>), though "analysis" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.

The word comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> ἀνάλυσις ("analysis", "a breaking up", from "ana-" "up, throughout" and "lysis" "a loosening").

As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to <a href="Alhazen">Alhazen</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> ("<a href="Discourse%20on%20the%20Method">Discourse on the Method</a>"), and <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>. It has also been ascribed to <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>, in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name).

The field of <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> uses analysis in at least three ways: to identify the components of a particular <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a> (qualitative analysis), to identify the proportions of components in a <a href="mixture">mixture</a> (quantitative analysis), and to break down <a href="chemical%20process">chemical process</a>es and examine <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s between <a href="chemical%20element">elements</a> of <a href="chemical%20matter">matter</a>.

While not all literary-critical methods are primarily analytical in nature, the main approach to the teaching of literature in the west since the mid-twentieth century, literary formal analysis or close reading, is. This method, rooted in the academic movement labelled <a href="The%20New%20Criticism">The New Criticism</a>, approaches texts - chiefly short poems such as <a href="sonnets">sonnets</a>, which by virtue of their small size and significant complexity lend themselves well to this type of analysis - as units of discourse that can be understood in themselves, without reference to biographical or historical frameworks. This method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in a study of <a href="prosody%20%28linguistics%29">prosody</a> (the formal analysis of meter) and phonic effects such as <a href="alliteration">alliteration</a> and <a href="rhyme">rhyme</a>, and cognitively in examination of the interplay of syntactic structures, figurative language, and other elements of the poem that work to produce its larger effects.

Modern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes. It is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus. It can be applied in the study of <a href="classical%20mathematics">classical</a> concepts of mathematics, such as <a href="real%20analysis">real numbers</a>, <a href="complex%20analysis">complex variables</a>, <a href="Fourier%20analysis">trigonometric functions</a>, and <a href="numerical%20analysis">algorithms</a>, or of <a href="non-classical%20analysis">non-classical</a> concepts like <a href="constructivist%20analysis">constructivism</a>, <a href="harmonic%20analysis">harmonics</a>, <a href="non-standard%20analysis">infinity</a>, and <a href="functional%20analysis">vectors</a>.

<a href="Florian%20Cajori">Florian Cajori</a> explains in (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows:

The terms "synthesis" and "analysis" are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic. In ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have. The oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in [appended to] <a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Euclid</a>, XIII. 5, which in all probability was framed by <a href="Eudoxus%20of%20Cnidus">Eudoxus</a>: "Analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth; synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it." 

The analytic method is not conclusive, unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible. To remove all doubt, the Greeks, as a rule, added to the analytic process a synthetic one, consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis. Thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions.
James Gow uses a similar argument as Cajori, with the following clarification, in his <a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DKSe_ZEmHaXEC%26amp%3B">"A Short History of Greek Mathematics"</a> (1884):
The synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths. An analytic proof begins by an assumption, upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded. The Greeks distinguished "theoretic" from "problematic" analysis. A theoretic analysis is of the following kind. To "prove" that A is B, "assume" first that A is B. If so, then, since B is C and C is D and D is E, therefore A is E. If this be known a falsity, A is not B. But if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be <a href="wiktionary%3Aconvertible%23Adjective">convertible</a>, then the reverse process, A is E, E is D, D is C, C is B, therefore A is B, constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem. Problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition. The problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically, and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem.





In <a href="statistics">statistics</a>, the term "analysis" may refer to any method used
for <a href="data%20analysis">data analysis</a>. Among the many such methods, some are:

Abner Doubleday

Abner Doubleday (June 26, 1819January 26, 1893) was a career <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> officer and <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> general in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. He fired the first shot in defense of <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, the opening battle of the war, and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>. Gettysburg was his finest hour, but his relief by <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="George%20G.%20Meade">George G. Meade</a> caused lasting enmity between the two men. In <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, after the war, he obtained a patent on the <a href="cable%20car%20%28railway%29">cable car</a> railway that still runs there. In his final years in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, he was a prominent member and later president of the <a href="Theosophical%20Society">Theosophical Society</a>. Doubleday has been historically credited with <a href="Doubleday%20myth">inventing baseball</a>, although this is untrue.

Doubleday, the son of <a href="Ulysses%20F.%20Doubleday">Ulysses F. Doubleday</a> and Hester Donnelly, was born in <a href="Ballston%20Spa%2C%20New%20York">Ballston Spa, New York</a>, in a small house on the corner of Washington and Fenwick streets. As a child, Abner was very short. The family all slept in the attic loft of the one-room house. His paternal grandfather, also named Abner, had fought in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. His maternal grandfather <a href="Thomas%20Donnelly%20%28sergeant-at-arms%29">Thomas Donnelly</a> joined the army at 14 and was a mounted messenger for <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>. His great grandfather Peter Donnelly was a Minuteman. His father, Ulysses F. Doubleday, fought in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, published newspapers and books, and represented <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20York">Auburn, New York</a> for four years in the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. Abner spent his childhood in Auburn and later was sent to <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown</a> to live with his uncle and attend a private preparatory high school. He practiced as a surveyor and civil engineer for two years before entering the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> in 1838. He graduated in 1842, 24th in a class of 56 cadets, and was commissioned a <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="second%20lieutenant%23United%20States">second lieutenant</a> in the 3rd U.S. Artillery. In 1852, he married Mary Hewitt of <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a>, the daughter of a local lawyer.

Doubleday initially served in coastal garrisons and then in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> from 1846 to 1848 and the <a href="Seminole%20Wars">Seminole Wars</a> from 1856 to 1858. In 1858 he was transferred to <a href="Fort%20Moultrie">Fort Moultrie</a> in <a href="Charleston%20Harbor">Charleston Harbor</a> serving under Colonel <a href="John%20L.%20Gardner%20%28brigadier%20general%29">John L. Gardner</a>. By the start of the Civil War, he was a <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a> and second in command in the garrison at <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>, under <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28Civil%20War%29">Robert Anderson</a>. He aimed the cannon that fired the first return shot in answer to the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> bombardment on April 12, 1861. He subsequently referred to himself as the "hero of Sumter" for this role.

Doubleday was promoted to major on May 14, 1861, and commanded the Artillery Department in the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> from June to August, and then the artillery for <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Nathaniel%20Banks">Nathaniel Banks</a>'s division of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>. He was appointed <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> of volunteers on February 3, 1862, and was assigned to duty in northern Virginia while the Army of the Potomac conducted the <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>. His first combat assignment was to lead the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, <a href="III%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">III Corps</a> of the <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a> during the <a href="Northern%20Virginia%20Campaign">Northern Virginia Campaign</a>. In the actions at Brawner's farm, just before the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>, he took the initiative to send two of his regiments to reinforce Brigadier General <a href="John%20Gibbon">John Gibbon</a>'s brigade against a larger Confederate force, fighting it to a standstill. (Personal initiative was required since his division commander, Brig. Gen. <a href="Rufus%20King%20%28Civil%20War%20General%29">Rufus King</a>, was incapacitated by an <a href="epilepsy">epileptic</a> seizure at the time. He was replaced by Brigadier General <a href="John%20P.%20Hatch">John P. Hatch</a>.) His men were routed when they encountered Major General <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a>'s corps, but by the following day, August 30, he took command of the division when Hatch was wounded, and he led his men to cover the retreat of the Union Army.

Doubleday again led the division, now assigned to the <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">I Corps</a> of the Army of the Potomac, after <a href="Battle%20of%20South%20Mountain">South Mountain</a>, where Hatch was wounded again. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Antietam</a>, he led his men into the deadly fighting in the Cornfield and the West Woods, and one colonel described him as a "gallant officer ... remarkably cool and at the very front of battle." He was wounded when an artillery shell exploded near his horse, throwing him to the ground in a violent fall. He received a brevet promotion to <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> in the <a href="Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">regular army</a> for his actions at Antietam and was promoted in March 1863 to <a href="Major%20General%23United%20States">major general</a> of volunteers, to rank from November 29, 1862. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Fredericksburg</a> in December 1862, his division mostly sat idle. During the winter, the I Corps was reorganized and Doubleday assumed command of the 3rd Division. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Chancellorsville</a> in May 1863, the division was kept in reserve.

At the start of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, July 1, 1863, Doubleday's division was the second infantry division on the field to reinforce the cavalry division of Brigadier General <a href="John%20Buford">John Buford</a>. When his corps commander, Major General <a href="John%20F.%20Reynolds">John F. Reynolds</a>, was killed very early in the fighting, Doubleday found himself in command of the corps at 10:50 am. His men fought well in the morning, putting up a stout resistance, but as overwhelming Confederate forces massed against them, their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of <a href="Gettysburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gettysburg</a> to the relative safety of <a href="Cemetery%20Hill">Cemetery Hill</a> south of town. It was Doubleday's finest performance during the war, five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000. Seven of those brigades sustained casualties that ranged from 35 to 50 percent, indicating the ferocity of the Union defense. On Cemetery Hill, however, the I Corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty, and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle; it would be decommissioned in March 1864, its surviving units consolidated into other corps.

On July 2, 1863, Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20G.%20Meade">George G. Meade</a> replaced Doubleday with Major General <a href="John%20Newton%20%28engineer%29">John Newton</a>, a more junior officer from another corps. The ostensible reason was a false report by <a href="XI%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">XI Corps</a> commander Major General <a href="Oliver%20O.%20Howard">Oliver O. Howard</a> that Doubleday's corps broke first, causing the entire Union line to collapse, but Meade also had a long history of disdain for Doubleday's combat effectiveness, dating back to South Mountain. Doubleday was humiliated by this snub and held a lasting grudge against Meade, but he returned to division command and fought well for the remainder of the battle. He was wounded in the neck on the second day of Gettysburg and received a brevet promotion to colonel in the regular army for his service. He formally requested reinstatement as I Corps commander, but Meade refused, and Doubleday left Gettysburg on July 7 for Washington.

Doubleday's indecision as a commander in the war resulted in his uncomplimentary nickname "Forty-Eight Hours."

Doubleday assumed administrative duties in the defenses of <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, where he was in charge of courts martial, which gave him legal experience that he used after the war. His only return to combat was directing a portion of the defenses against the attack by Confederate <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28CSA%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Jubal%20A.%20Early">Jubal A. Early</a> in the <a href="Valley%20Campaigns%20of%201864">Valley Campaigns of 1864</a>. Also while in Washington, Doubleday testified against George Meade at the <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20the%20Conduct%20of%20the%20War">United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War</a>, criticizing him harshly over his conduct of the Battle of Gettysburg. While in Washington, Doubleday remained a loyal <a href="History%20of%20the%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> and staunch supporter of President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Doubleday rode with Lincoln on the train to Gettysburg for the <a href="Gettysburg%20Address">Gettysburg Address</a> and Col. and Mrs. Doubleday attended events with Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln in Washington.

After the Civil War, Doubleday mustered out of the volunteer service on August 24, 1865, reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and became the colonel of the 35th U.S. Infantry in September 1867. He was stationed in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> from 1869 through 1871 and he took out a patent for the <a href="cable%20car%20%28railway%29">cable car</a> railway that still runs there, receiving a charter for its operation, but signing away his rights when he was reassigned. In 1871 he commanded the <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">24th U.S. Infantry</a>, an all African-American regiment with headquarters at <a href="Fort%20McKavett">Fort McKavett</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. He retired in 1873

In the 1870s, he was listed in the New York business directory as lawyer.

Doubleday spent much of his time writing. He published two important works on the Civil War: "Reminiscences of Forts Sumter and Moultrie" (1876), and "Chancellorsville and Gettysburg" (1882), the latter being a volume of the series "Campaigns of the Civil War".

In the summer of 1878, Doubleday lived in <a href="Mendham%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mendham Township, New Jersey</a>, and became a prominent member of the <a href="Theosophical%20Society">Theosophical Society</a>. When two of the founders of that society, <a href="Helena%20Blavatsky">Helena Blavatsky</a> and <a href="Henry%20Steel%20Olcott">Henry Steel Olcott</a>, moved to India at the end of that year, he was constituted as the president of the American body. Another prominent member was <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Edison">Thomas A. Edison</a>.

Doubleday died of heart disease. Doubleday's body was laid in state in New York's City Hall and then was taken to Washington by train from Mendham Township, and is buried in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a>.

Although Doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important Civil War battles, he is more widely remembered as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball, in <a href="Elihu%20Phinney">Elihu Phinney</a>'s cow pasture in <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>, in 1839.

The <a href="Mills%20Commission">Mills Commission</a>, chaired by <a href="Abraham%20G.%20Mills">Abraham G. Mills</a>, the fourth president of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>, was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball. The committee's final report, on December 30, 1907, stated, in part, that "the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence obtainable to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, New York, in 1839." It concluded by saying, "in the years to come, in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball, and the millions who will be, Abner Doubleday's fame will rest evenly, if not quite as much, upon the fact that he was its inventor ... as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the Federal Army."

However, there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described the results of the Mills Commission as a "myth". He wrote, "Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown." At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game, and his "New York Times" obituary did not mention the game at all. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday's body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose credibility is questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life. Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839.

Despite the lack of solid evidence linking Doubleday to the origins of baseball, Cooperstown, New York became the new home of what is today the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum</a> in 1937.

There may have been some relationship to baseball as a national sport and Abner Doubleday. While the modern rules of baseball were formulated in New York during the 1840s, it was the scattering of New Yorkers exposed to these rules throughout the country, that spread not only baseball, but also the "New York Rules", thereby harmonizing the rules, and being a catalyst for its growth. Doubleday was a high-ranking officer, whose duties included seeing to provisions for the US Army fighting throughout the south and border states. For the morale of the men, he is said to have provisioned balls and bats for the men.

There is a monument to Doubleday at Gettysburg erected by his men, admirers, and the state of New York. There is a obelisk monument at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> where he is buried, located about behind the Lee Mansion. There was a movement to petition the <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">postmaster general</a> to issue a U.S. postage stamp for him in 2011, commemorating the 150th anniversary of Fort Sumter. <a href="Doubleday%20Field">Doubleday Field</a> is a <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league baseball</a> <a href="stadium">stadium</a> named for Abner Doubleday, located in <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>, near the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>. It hosted the annual <a href="Doubleday%20Field%23halloffamegame">Hall of Fame Game</a>, an <a href="exhibition%20game">exhibition game</a> between two <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">major league</a> teams that was played from 1940 until 2008.

The <a href="Auburn%20Doubledays">Auburn Doubledays</a> are a <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league baseball</a> team based in Doubleday's hometown of <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20York">Auburn, New York</a>.

The Abner Doubleday Little League and Babe Ruth Fields in Ballston Spa, New York, the town of his birth. The house of his birth still stands in the middle of town and there is a monument to him on Front Street.

A sign at the <a href="Doubleday%20Hill%20Monument">Doubleday Hill Monument</a>, erected in <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Maryland">Williamsport, Maryland</a> to commemorate Doubleday's occupation of a hill there during the Civil War, claims he invented the game in 1835.

Mendham Borough, NJ and Mendham Township, NJ held a municipal holiday known as "Abner Doubleday Day" for numerous years in the General's honor and commissioned a plaque near the sight of his home in the borough in 1998, even though the borough was known as Mendham Township back then.

In 2004 the Abner Doubleday Society erected a monument to Doubleday in Iron Spring Park, Ballston Spa, near his birthplace.

In the movie "<a href="The%20Ridiculous%206">The Ridiculous 6</a>", Doubleday is portrayed by <a href="John%20Turturro">John Turturro</a>. The character organizes the first game of baseball between the six main characters and a group of Chinese immigrants, creating the rules as he goes, primarily to allow him to win.

In the 23rd episode of the anime "<a href="Samurai%20Champloo">Samurai Champloo</a>", titled "Baseball Blues", Doubleday and <a href="Alexander%20Cartwright">Alexander Cartwright</a> are featured as American naval officers who engage the main characters and local Japanese people into a baseball game, which the Americans lose.

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a <a href="modulation">modulation</a> technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a <a href="radio">radio</a> <a href="carrier%20wave">carrier wave</a>. In amplitude modulation, the <a href="amplitude">amplitude</a> (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the waveform being transmitted. That waveform may, for instance, correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by a <a href="loudspeaker">loudspeaker</a>, or the light intensity of television pixels. This technique contrasts with <a href="frequency%20modulation">frequency modulation</a>, in which the <a href="frequency">frequency</a> of the <a href="carrier%20signal">carrier signal</a> is varied, and <a href="phase%20modulation">phase modulation</a>, in which its <a href="Phase%20%28waves%29">phase</a> is varied.

AM was the earliest modulation method used to transmit voice by radio. It was developed during the first two decades of the 20th century beginning with <a href="Landell%20de%20Moura">Landell de Moura</a> and <a href="Reginald%20Fessenden">Reginald Fessenden</a>'s <a href="radiotelephone">radiotelephone</a> experiments in 1900. It remains in use today in many forms of communication; for example it is used in portable <a href="two-way%20radio">two-way radio</a>s, <a href="Airband">VHF aircraft radio</a>, <a href="Citizen%27s%20Band%20Radio">Citizen's Band Radio</a>, and in computer <a href="modem">modem</a>s (in the form of <a href="QAM">QAM</a>). "AM" is often used to refer to <a href="mediumwave">mediumwave</a> <a href="AM%20broadcasting">AM radio broadcasting</a>.

In <a href="electronics">electronics</a> and <a href="telecommunication">telecommunication</a>s, <a href="modulation">modulation</a> means varying some aspect of a higher frequency <a href="continuous%20wave">continuous wave</a> <a href="carrier%20signal">carrier signal</a> with an information-bearing modulation waveform, such as an <a href="audio%20signal">audio signal</a> which represents sound, or a <a href="video%20signal">video signal</a> which represents images, so the carrier will "carry" the information. When it reaches its destination, the information signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by <a href="demodulation">demodulation</a>.

In amplitude modulation, the <a href="amplitude">amplitude</a> or "strength" of the carrier oscillations is what is varied. For example, in AM radio communication, a <a href="continuous%20wave">continuous wave</a> radio-frequency signal (a <a href="Sine%20wave">sinusoid</a>al <a href="carrier%20wave">carrier wave</a>) has its <a href="amplitude">amplitude</a> <a href="modulation">modulated</a> by an audio waveform before transmission. The audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the "<a href="Envelope%20%28waves%29">envelope</a>" of the waveform. In the <a href="frequency%20domain">frequency domain</a>, amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the <a href="carrier%20frequency">carrier frequency</a> and two adjacent <a href="sideband">sideband</a>s. Each sideband is equal in <a href="bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> to that of the modulating signal, and is a mirror image of the other. Standard AM is thus sometimes called "double-sideband amplitude modulation" (DSB-AM) to distinguish it from more sophisticated modulation methods also based on AM.

One disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques (not only standard AM) is that the receiver amplifies and detects <a href="Noise%20%28radio%29">noise</a> and <a href="electromagnetic%20interference">electromagnetic interference</a> in equal proportion to the signal. Increasing the received <a href="signal-to-noise%20ratio">signal-to-noise ratio</a>, say, by a factor of 10 (a 10 <a href="decibel">decibel</a> improvement), thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of 10. This is in contrast to <a href="frequency%20modulation">frequency modulation</a> (FM) and <a href="digital%20radio">digital radio</a> where the effect of such noise following <a href="demodulation">demodulation</a> is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception. For this reason AM broadcast is not favored for music and <a href="high%20fidelity">high fidelity</a> broadcasting, but rather for voice communications and broadcasts (sports, news, <a href="talk%20radio">talk radio</a> etc.).

Another disadvantage of AM is that it is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal. The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using <a href="envelope%20detector">envelope detection</a>, providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the <a href="intermediate%20frequency">intermediate frequency</a>) from a greatly reduced "pilot" carrier (in <a href="reduced-carrier%20transmission">reduced-carrier transmission</a> or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in <a href="double-sideband%20suppressed-carrier%20transmission">double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission</a>, carrier regeneration is possible using a <a href="Costas%20loop">Costas phase-locked loop</a>. This doesn't work however for <a href="single-sideband%20suppressed-carrier%20transmission">single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission</a> (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic "Donald Duck" sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in <a href="amateur%20radio">amateur radio</a> and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in <a href="medium%20wave">medium wave</a> and <a href="short%20wave">short wave</a> broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.

An additional function provided by the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the <a href="automatic%20gain%20control">automatic gain control</a> (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is "no" transmitted power during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called "fast attack, slow decay" circuit which holds the AGC level for a second or more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where <a href="Dynamic%20range%20compression">compression</a> of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.

A trivial form of AM which can be used for transmitting <a href="Digital%20data">binary data</a> is <a href="on-off%20keying">on-off keying</a>, the simplest form of "<a href="amplitude-shift%20keying">amplitude-shift keying</a>", in which <a href="Binary%20numeral%20system">ones and zeros</a> are represented by the presence or absence of a carrier. On-off keying is likewise used by radio amateurs to transmit <a href="Morse%20code">Morse code</a> where it is known as <a href="continuous%20wave">continuous wave</a> (CW) operation, even though the transmission is not strictly "continuous." A more complex form of AM, <a href="QAM">Quadrature amplitude modulation</a> is now more commonly used with digital data, while making more efficient use of the available bandwidth.

In 1982, the <a href="International%20Telecommunication%20Union">International Telecommunication Union</a> (ITU) designated the types of amplitude modulation:

Although AM was used in a few crude experiments in multiplex telegraph and telephone transmission in the late 1800s, the practical development of amplitude modulation is synonymous with the development between 1900 and 1920 of "<a href="radiotelephone">radiotelephone</a>" transmission, that is, the effort to send sound (audio) by radio waves. The first radio transmitters, called <a href="spark%20gap%20transmitter">spark gap transmitter</a>s, transmitted information by <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a>, using different length pulses of carrier wave to spell out text messages in <a href="Morse%20code">Morse code</a>. They couldn't transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of <a href="damped%20wave">damped wave</a>s, pulses of radio waves that declined to zero, that sounded like a buzz in receivers. In effect they were already amplitude modulated.

The first AM transmission was made by Canadian researcher <a href="Reginald%20Fessenden">Reginald Fessenden</a> on 23 December 1900 using a <a href="spark%20gap%20transmitter">spark gap transmitter</a> with a specially designed high frequency 10 kHz <a href="induction%20coil">interrupter</a>, over a distance of 1 mile (1.6 km) at Cobb Island, Maryland, USA. His first transmitted words were, "Hello. One, two, three, four. Is it snowing where you are, Mr. Thiessen?". The words were barely intelligible above the background buzz of the spark.

Fessenden was a significant figure in the development of AM radio. He was one of the first researchers to realize, from experiments like the above, that the existing technology for producing radio waves, the spark transmitter, was not usable for amplitude modulation, and that a new kind of transmitter, one that produced <a href="sinusoidal">sinusoidal</a> "<a href="continuous%20wave">continuous wave</a>s", was needed. This was a radical idea at the time, because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves, and Fessenden was ridiculed. He invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters - the <a href="Alexanderson%20alternator">Alexanderson alternator</a>, with which he made what is considered the first AM public entertainment broadcast on Christmas Eve, 1906. He also discovered the principle on which AM is based, <a href="heterodyne">heterodyning</a>, and invented one of the first <a href="detector%20%28radio%29">detector</a>s able to <a href="rectifier">rectify</a> and receive AM, the electrolytic detector or "liquid baretter", in 1902. Other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy, such as the <a href="Fleming%20valve">Fleming valve</a> (1904) and the <a href="crystal%20detector">crystal detector</a> (1906) also proved able to rectify AM signals, so the technological hurdle was generating AM waves; receiving them was not a problem.

Early experiments in AM radio transmission, conducted by Fessenden, Valdemar Poulsen, Ernst Ruhmer, <a href="Quirino%20Majorana">Quirino Majorana</a>, Charles Harrold, and <a href="Lee%20De%20Forest">Lee De Forest</a>, were hampered by the lack of a technology for <a href="amplifier">amplification</a>. The first practical continuous wave AM <a href="transmitter">transmitter</a>s were based on either the huge, expensive <a href="Alexanderson%20alternator">Alexanderson alternator</a>, developed 1906-1910, or versions of the <a href="Poulsen%20arc">Poulsen arc</a> transmitter (arc converter), invented in 1903. The modifications necessary to transmit AM were clumsy and resulted in very low quality audio. Modulation was usually accomplished by a carbon <a href="microphone">microphone</a> inserted directly in the antenna or ground wire; its varying resistance varied the current to the antenna. The limited power handling ability of the microphone severely limited the power of the first radiotelephones; many of the microphones were water-cooled.

The discovery in 1912 of the amplifying ability of the <a href="Audion">Audion</a> <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>, invented in 1906 by <a href="Lee%20De%20Forest">Lee De Forest</a>, solved these problems. The vacuum tube <a href="electronic%20oscillator">feedback oscillator</a>, invented in 1912 by <a href="Edwin%20Armstrong">Edwin Armstrong</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Meissner">Alexander Meissner</a>, was a cheap source of <a href="continuous%20wave">continuous wave</a>s and could be easily <a href="modulation">modulated</a> to make an AM transmitter. Modulation did not have to be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the final amplifier tube, so the microphone or other audio source didn't have to handle high power. Wartime research greatly advanced the art of AM modulation, and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked a great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music. The vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of <a href="AM%20broadcasting">AM radio broadcasting</a> around 1920, the first electronic <a href="mass%20communication">mass entertainment</a> medium. Amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for <a href="radio%20broadcasting">radio broadcasting</a> until <a href="FM%20broadcasting">FM broadcasting</a> began after World War 2.

At the same time as AM radio began, <a href="telephone%20company">telephone companies</a> such as <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a> were developing the other large application for AM: sending multiple telephone calls through a single wire by modulating them on separate <a href="carrier%20signal">carrier</a> frequencies, called "<a href="frequency%20division%20multiplexing">frequency division multiplexing</a>".

John Renshaw Carson in 1915 did the first mathematical analysis of amplitude modulation, showing that a signal and carrier frequency combined in a nonlinear device would create two sidebands on either side of the carrier frequency, and passing the modulated signal through another nonlinear device would extract the original baseband signal. His analysis also showed only one sideband was necessary to transmit the audio signal, and Carson patented <a href="single-sideband%20modulation">single-sideband modulation</a> (SSB) on 1 December 1915. This more advanced variant of amplitude modulation was adopted by AT&T for <a href="longwave">longwave</a> transatlantic telephone service beginning 7 January 1927. After WW2 it was developed by the military for aircraft communication.

Consider a carrier wave (<a href="sine%20wave">sine wave</a>) of frequency "f" and amplitude "A" given by:

Let "m"("t") represent the modulation waveform. For this example we shall take the modulation to be simply a sine wave of a frequency "f", a much lower frequency (such as an audio frequency) than "f":

where "M" is the amplitude of the modulation. We shall insist that "M"<1 so that "(1+m(t))" is always positive. If "M">1 then overmodulation occurs and reconstruction of message signal from the transmitted signal would lead in loss of original signal. Amplitude modulation results when the carrier "c(t)" is multiplied by the positive quantity "(1+m(t))":

In this simple case "M" is identical to the <a href="%23Modulation%20index">modulation index</a>, discussed below. With "M"=0.5 the amplitude modulated signal "y"("t") thus corresponds to the top graph (labelled "50% Modulation") in Figure 4.

Using <a href="Prosthaphaeresis%23The%20identities">prosthaphaeresis identities</a>, "y"("t") can be shown to be the sum of three sine waves:

Therefore, the modulated signal has three components: the carrier wave "c(t)" which is unchanged, and two pure sine waves (known as <a href="sideband">sideband</a>s) with frequencies slightly above and below the carrier frequency "f".

Of course a useful modulation signal "m(t)" will generally not consist of a single sine wave, as treated above. However, by the principle of <a href="Fourier%20decomposition">Fourier decomposition</a>, "m(t)" can be expressed as the sum of a number of sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of "1+m(t)" with "c(t)" as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves. Again the carrier "c(t)" is present unchanged, but for each frequency component of "m" at "f" there are two sidebands at frequencies "f + f" and "f - f". The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the lower sideband. In a slightly different way of looking at it, we can consider the modulation "m(t)" to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal <a href="Fourier%20transform">Fourier transform</a> of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation "m(t)" having simply been shifted in frequency by "f" as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 2 for completeness).
If we just look at the short-term spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted "above" the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.

The RF bandwidth of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, but only considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or "<a href="baseband">baseband</a>") signal, since the upper and lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using <a href="frequency%20modulation">frequency modulation</a> (FM), it is twice as wide as <a href="single-sideband">single-sideband</a> techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only half as many transmissions (or "channels") can thus be accommodated. For this reason analog television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as <a href="vestigial%20sideband">vestigial sideband</a>, somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) in order to reduce the required channel spacing.

Another improvement over standard AM is obtained through reduction or suppression of the carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus there is a great advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (<a href="single-sideband%20suppressed-carrier%20transmission">single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission</a>) or with both sidebands remaining (<a href="double%20sideband%20suppressed%20carrier">double sideband suppressed carrier</a>). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing <a href="Product%20detector">synchronous detection</a> and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using <a href="envelope%20detector">envelope detection</a>. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.

The AM modulation index is a measure based on the ratio of the modulation excursions of the RF signal to the level of the unmodulated carrier. It is thus defined as:
where formula_5 and formula_6 are the modulation amplitude and carrier amplitude, respectively; the modulation amplitude is the peak (positive or negative) change in the RF amplitude from its unmodulated value. Modulation index is normally expressed as a percentage, and may be displayed on a meter connected to an AM transmitter.

So if formula_7, carrier amplitude varies by 50% above (and below) its unmodulated level, as is shown in the first waveform, below. For formula_8, it varies by 100% as shown in the illustration below it. With 100% modulation the wave amplitude sometimes reaches zero, and this represents full modulation using standard AM and is often a target (in order to obtain the highest possible <a href="signal-to-noise%20ratio">signal-to-noise ratio</a>) but mustn't be exceeded. Increasing the modulating signal beyond that point, known as <a href="overmodulation">overmodulation</a>, causes a standard AM modulator (see below) to fail, as the negative excursions of the wave envelope cannot become less than zero, resulting in <a href="distortion">distortion</a> ("clipping") of the received modulation. Transmitters typically incorporate a <a href="limiter">limiter</a> circuit to avoid overmodulation, and/or a <a href="Dynamic%20range%20compression">compressor</a> circuit (especially for voice communications) in order to still approach 100% modulation for maximum intelligibility above the noise. Such circuits are sometimes referred to as a <a href="vogad">vogad</a>.

However it is possible to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of <a href="double-sideband%20reduced-carrier%20transmission">double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission</a>. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase, as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power <a href="broadcast">broadcast</a> transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a <a href="linear%20amplifier">linear amplifier</a>. What's more, a standard AM receiver using an <a href="envelope%20detector">envelope detector</a> is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally "not" referred to as "AM" even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the modulation index is below 100%. Such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands (where the useful information is present) to the point of <a href="double-sideband%20suppressed-carrier%20transmission">double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission</a> where the carrier is (ideally) reduced to zero. In all such cases the term "modulation index" loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small (or zero) remaining carrier amplitude.

Modulation circuit designs may be classified as low- or high-level (depending on whether they modulate in a low-power domain—followed by amplification for transmission—or in the high-power domain of the transmitted signal).

In modern radio systems, modulated signals are generated via <a href="digital%20signal%20processing">digital signal processing</a> (DSP). With DSP many types of AM are possible with software control (including DSB with carrier, SSB suppressed-carrier and independent sideband, or ISB). Calculated digital samples are converted to voltages with a <a href="digital-to-analog%20converter">digital-to-analog converter</a>, typically at a frequency less than the desired RF-output frequency. The analog signal must then be shifted in frequency and <a href="linear%20amplifier">linearly amplified</a> to the desired frequency and power level (linear amplification must be used to prevent modulation distortion).
This low-level method for AM is used in many Amateur Radio transceivers.

AM may also be generated at a low level, using analog methods described in the next section.

High-power AM <a href="transmitter">transmitter</a>s (such as those used for <a href="AM%20broadcasting">AM broadcasting</a>) are based on high-efficiency <a href="Class-D%20amplifier">class-D</a> and class-E <a href="Electronic%20amplifier">power amplifier</a> stages, modulated by varying the supply voltage.

Older designs (for broadcast and amateur radio) also generate AM by controlling the gain of the transmitter’s final amplifier (generally class-C, for efficiency). The following types are for vacuum tube transmitters (but similar options are available with transistors):


The simplest form of AM demodulator consists of a diode which is configured to act as <a href="envelope%20detector">envelope detector</a>. Another type of demodulator, the <a href="product%20detector">product detector</a>, can provide better-quality demodulation with additional circuit complexity.

Augustin-Jean Fresnel

Augustin-Jean Fresnel ( ; ; 10 May 1788 – 14 July 1827) was a <a href="France">French</a> <a href="engineer">engineer</a> and <a href="physicist">physicist</a> who contributed significantly to the establishment of the theory of <a href="wave">wave optics</a>. Fresnel studied the behaviour of light both theoretically and experimentally.

He is perhaps best known as the <a href="inventor">inventor</a> of the <a href="Fresnel%20lens">Fresnel lens</a>, first adopted in <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a>s while he was a French commissioner of lighthouses, and found in many applications today. His equations on waves and <a href="reflectivity">reflectivity</a>, the <a href="Fresnel%20equations">Fresnel equations</a>, also form the basis for many applications in <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a> today – for instance, the rendering of water.

Fresnel was the son of an architect, born at <a href="Broglie%2C%20Eure">Broglie</a> (in present-day <a href="Eure">Eure</a>). He received a rigorous Catholic upbringing from his parents, who were involved in the <a href="Jansenism">Jansenist</a> movement. His early progress in learning was slow, and he still could not read when he was eight years old. At thirteen he entered the École Centrale in <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, and at sixteen and a half the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a>, where he acquitted himself with distinction. From there he went to the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Nationale%20des%20Ponts%20et%20Chauss%C3%A9es">École des Ponts et Chaussées</a>.

He made many contributions to the development of the field of <a href="Optical%20physics">optical science</a>. Some of his papers were not printed by the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Sciences">Académie des Sciences</a> until many years after his death. But as he wrote to <a href="Thomas%20Young%20%28scientist%29">Young</a> in 1824: in himself "that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory" had been blunted. "All the compliments," he says, "that I have received from <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Arago">Arago</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Simon%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Laplace">Laplace</a> and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Biot">Biot</a> never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment".

Fresnel has been described as a man with interest in religious questions and deep faith in God. As a form of consolation, he took religion very seriously especially during his illness.

He spent much of his life in Paris, and died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> at <a href="Ville-d%27Avray">Ville-d'Avray</a>, near Paris. His is one of the <a href="List%20of%20the%2072%20names%20on%20the%20Eiffel%20Tower">72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower</a>. The writer <a href="Prosper%20M%C3%A9rim%C3%A9e">Prosper Mérimée</a> (1803-1870) was his first cousin.

He served as an engineer successively in the departments of <a href="Vend%C3%A9e">Vendée</a>, <a href="Dr%C3%B4me">Drôme</a> and <a href="Ille-et-Vilaine">Ille-et-Vilaine</a>; but having supported the <a href="Bourbon%20house">Bourbons</a> in 1814 he lost his appointment on <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s return to power. He appears to have begun his research in optics around 1814, when he prepared a paper on the <a href="aberration%20of%20light">aberration of light</a>, although it was never published. In 1815, on the second restoration of the monarchy, he obtained a post as engineer in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>.

In 1818 he wrote a treatise on <a href="diffraction">diffraction</a>, for which he received the prize of the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Académie des Sciences</a> at Paris the following year. He was the first to construct a special type of lens, now called a <a href="Fresnel%20lens">Fresnel lens</a>, as a substitute for mirrors in lighthouses. In 1819, he was nominated to be a commissioner of lighthouses. In 1823 he was unanimously elected a member of the academy. In 1825 he became a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20London">Royal Society of London</a>. In 1827, the time of his last illness, the Royal Society of London awarded him the <a href="Rumford%20Medal">Rumford Medal</a>.

His discoveries and mathematical deductions, building on experimental work by <a href="Thomas%20Young%20%28scientist%29">Thomas Young</a>, extended the <a href="Huygens%27%20principle">wave theory</a> of <a href="light">light</a> to a large class of <a href="optical%20phenomenon">optical phenomena</a>, especially, to the <a href="Birefringence">double-refraction</a> property of <a href="Iceland%20Spar">Iceland Spar</a>, or <a href="calcite">calcite</a>.

In 1817, Young had proposed a small transverse component to light, while yet retaining a far larger longitudinal component. Fresnel, by the year 1821, was able to show by mathematical methods that <a href="polarization%20%28waves%29">polarization</a> could be explained only if light was "entirely" transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever. He proposed the <a href="aether%20drag%20hypothesis">aether drag hypothesis</a> to explain a lack of variation in astronomical observations. His use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180°, allowed him to avoid the diffraction effects caused (by the apertures) in the experiment of <a href="Francesco%20Maria%20Grimaldi">F. M. Grimaldi</a> on <a href="Interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference</a>. This allowed him to conclusively account for the phenomenon of interference in accordance with the wave theory.

The "Fresnel bright spot", also referred to as the "Poisson spot", or the "Spot of Arago", is a bright point that appears at the center of a circular object's <a href="shadow">shadow</a> due to <a href="Fresnel%20diffraction">Fresnel diffraction</a>. The experimental demonstration of the existence of Fresnel's spot, predicted to be a consequence of Fresnel's 1818 wave theory by <a href="Sim%C3%A9on%20Denis%20Poisson">Poisson</a>, played an key role in the proof of the wave nature of light, and is a common way to demonstrate that light behaves as a wave.

With <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Arago">François Arago</a> he studied the laws of the interference of polarized rays. He obtained circularly polarized light by means of a rhombus of glass, known as a <a href="Fresnel%20rhomb">Fresnel rhomb</a>, having obtuse angles of 126° and acute angles of 54°. The <a href="Fresnel%E2%80%93Arago%20laws">Fresnel–Arago laws</a> are three laws which summarise some of the more important properties of <a href="Interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference</a> between light of different states of <a href="polarization%20%28waves%29">polarization</a>. The laws are as follows:

The <a href="Fresnel%20equations">Fresnel equations</a> describe the behaviour of <a href="light">light</a> when moving between <a href="medium%20%28optics%29">media</a> of differing <a href="refractive%20index">refractive indices</a>. When light moves from a medium of a given <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a> "n" into a second medium with refractive index "n", both <a href="reflection%20%28physics%29">reflection</a> and <a href="refraction">refraction</a> of the light may occur.

The <a href="Fresnel%20diffraction">Fresnel diffraction</a> equation is an approximation of <a href="Kirchhoff%27s%20diffraction%20formula">Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction</a> that can be applied to the propagation of waves in the <a href="near%20and%20far%20field">near field</a>. It is used to calculate the <a href="diffraction%20pattern">diffraction pattern</a> created by waves passing through an aperture or around an object, when viewed from relatively close to the object. In contrast the diffraction pattern in the <a href="near%20and%20far%20field">far field</a> region is given by the <a href="Fraunhofer%20diffraction">Fraunhofer diffraction</a> equation.

Abbot

Abbot, meaning father, is an <a href="ecclesiastic">ecclesiastic</a>al <a href="title">title</a> given to the <a href="male">male</a> head of a <a href="monastery">monastery</a> in various traditions, including <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. The <a href="office">office</a> may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is <a href="abbess">abbess</a>.

The title had its origin in the <a href="monastery">monasteries</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, spread through the eastern <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean</a>, and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery. The word is derived from the <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> "av" meaning "father" or "abba", meaning "my father". In the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, it was written as "abbas". At first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk, but it was soon restricted by <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> to certain priestly superiors. At times it was applied to various priests, e.g. at the court of the Frankish monarchy the "Abbas palatinus" ("of the palace"') and "Abbas castrensis" ("of the camp") were chaplains to the Merovingian and Carolingian sovereigns’ court and army respectively. The title abbot came into fairly general use in western <a href="Christian%20monasticism">monastic</a> <a href="order%20%28religious%29">orders</a> whose members include priests.

An abbot (from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "abbod", "abbad", from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "abbas" (“father”), from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "ἀββᾶς" (abbas), from Aramaic "ܐܒܐ"/"אבא" (’abbā, “father”); confer German "Abt"; French "abbé") is the head and chief governor of a community of monks, called also in the East "<a href="hegumen">hegumen</a>" or "<a href="archimandrite">archimandrite</a>". The English version for a female monastic head is <a href="abbess">abbess</a>. 

In <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the first home of monasticism, the jurisdiction of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint <a href="John%20Cassian">John Cassian</a> speaks of an abbot of the <a href="Thebaid">Thebaid</a> who had 500 monks under him. By the <a href="Rule%20of%20St%20Benedict">Rule of St Benedict</a>, which, until the <a href="Cluniac%20reforms">Cluniac reforms</a>, was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Cluny">Cluniac</a> Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognized.

Monks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception. For the reception of the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s, and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the <a href="ordination">ordination</a> of some monks. This innovation was not introduced without a struggle, <a href="ecclesiology">ecclesiastical</a> dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher <a href="spirituality">spiritual</a> life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots seem almost universally to have become <a href="deacon">deacon</a>s, if not priests. The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils. Thus at the <a href="first%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">first Council of Constantinople</a>, AD 448, 23 <a href="archimandrite">archimandrite</a>s or abbots sign, with 30 <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s.

The <a href="second%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">second Council of Nicaea</a>, AD 787, recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders below the <a href="deacon">diaconate</a>, a power usually reserved to bishops.

Abbots used to be subject to <a href="bishop">episcopal</a> jurisdiction, and continued generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The <a href="Code%20of%20Justinian">Code of Justinian</a> (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory the Great</a>. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an "imperium in imperio," and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his <a href="diocese">diocese</a>.

In the 12th century, the abbots of <a href="Fulda%20monastery">Fulda</a> claimed precedence of the <a href="archdiocese%20of%20Cologne">archbishop of Cologne</a>. Abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state, and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of <a href="mitre">mitre</a>, ring, gloves and sandals.

It has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, "Liturgische Gewandung", p. 453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20II">Alexander II</a> in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The mitred abbots in England were those of <a href="Abingdon%20Abbey">Abingdon</a>, <a href="St%20Albans%20Abbey">St Alban's</a>, <a href="Bardney%20Abbey">Bardney</a>, <a href="Battle%20Abbey">Battle</a>, <a href="Bury%20St.%20Edmunds%20Abbey">Bury St Edmunds</a>, <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Canterbury</a>, <a href="Colchester%20Abbey">Colchester</a>, <a href="Crowland%20Abbey">Croyland</a>, <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham</a>, <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury</a>, <a href="Gloucester%20Abbey">Gloucester</a>, <a href="St%20Benet%27s%20Abbey">St Benet's Hulme</a>, <a href="Hyde%20Abbey">Hyde</a>, <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">Malmesbury</a>, <a href="Peterborough%20Abbey">Peterborough</a>, <a href="Ramsey%20Abbey">Ramsey</a>, <a href="Reading%20Abbey">Reading</a>, <a href="Selby%20Abbey">Selby</a>, <a href="Shrewsbury%20Abbey">Shrewsbury</a>, <a href="Tavistock%20Abbey">Tavistock</a>, <a href="Thorney%20Abbey">Thorney</a>, <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster</a>, <a href="Winchcombe%20Abbey">Winchcombe</a>, and <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Abbey%2C%20York">St Mary's York</a>. Of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20IV">Adrian IV</a> (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up. Next after the abbot of St Alban's ranked the abbot of Westminster and then Ramsey. Elsewhere, the mitred abbots that sat in the <a href="Estates%20of%20Scotland">Estates of Scotland</a> were of <a href="Arbroath%20Abbey">Arbroath</a>, <a href="Cambuskenneth%20Abbey">Cambuskenneth</a>, <a href="Coupar%20Angus%20Abbey">Coupar Angus</a>, <a href="Dunfermline%20Abbey">Dunfermline</a>, <a href="Holyrood%20Abbey">Holyrood</a>, <a href="Iona%20Abbey">Iona</a>, <a href="Kelso%20Abbey">Kelso</a>, <a href="Kilwinning%20Abbey">Kilwinning</a>, <a href="Kinloss%20Abbey">Kinloss</a>, <a href="Lindores%20Abbey">Lindores</a>, <a href="Paisley%20Abbey">Paisley</a>, <a href="Melrose%20Abbey">Melrose</a>, <a href="Scone%20Abbey">Scone</a>, <a href="St%20Andrews%20Cathedral%20Priory">St Andrews Priory</a> and <a href="Sweetheart%20Abbey">Sweetheart</a>. To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their <a href="crosier">pastoral staff</a> (the crosier) should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house.

The adoption of certain episcopal insignia (<a href="pontificalia">pontificalia</a>) by abbots was followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions, which had to be specially but ineffectually guarded against by the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Lateran council</a>, AD 1123. In the East abbots, if in priests' orders and with the consent of the bishop, were, as we have seen, permitted by the <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">second Nicene council</a>, AD 787, to confer the <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a> and admit to the order of reader; but gradually abbots, in the West also, advanced higher claims, until we find them in AD 1489 permitted by <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20IV">Innocent IV</a> to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate. Of course, they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit.

The power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited, however, by the <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>. One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection. It was sacred duty to execute the abbot's orders, and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression. Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.

When a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the <a href="abbey">convent</a>, but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In <a href="abbey">abbey</a>s exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and <a href="benediction">benediction</a> had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. It was necessary that an abbot should be at least 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience. In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8–12 years.

The ceremony of the formal admission of a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the <a href="Consuetudinary%20%28book%29">consuetudinary</a> of Abingdon. The newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession. After proceeding up the <a href="nave">nave</a>, he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his <a href="commissary">commissary</a>, and placed in his stall. The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his <a href="staff%20of%20office">staff of office</a>. He then put on his shoes in the <a href="vestry">vestry</a>, and a <a href="chapter%20%28religion%29">chapter</a> was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon.

Before the late modern era, the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house. When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed. His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king. No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society. The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table. In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks. In the West the <a href="Rule%20of%20St%20Benedict">Rule of St Benedict</a> appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers. Because this permission opened the door to luxurious living, <a href="Synods%20of%20Aachen%20%28816%E2%80%93819%29">Synods of Aachen (816–819)</a>, decreed that the abbot should dine in the <a href="refectory">refectory</a>, and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots. When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a>s waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.
The ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire. Some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by <a href="clerical%20celibacy">celibacy</a>. Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting. In magnificence of equipage and <a href="retinue">retinue</a> the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm. They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants. The bells of the churches were rung as they passed. They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits. This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially. For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury</a>, judicially murdered by <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>, that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons. The <a href="abbots%20of%20Cluny">abbots of Cluny</a> and <a href="Trinity%20Abbey%2C%20Vend%C3%B4me">Vendôme</a> were, by virtue of their office, <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinal</a>s of the Roman church.

In the process of time, the title abbot was extended to <a href="clergy%23Catholic%20clergy">clerics</a> who had no connection with the monastic system, as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy; and under the <a href="Charlemagne">Carolingians</a> to the chief chaplain of the king, ', or military chaplain of the emperor, ' It even came to be adopted by purely secular officials. Thus the chief magistrate of the republic at <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> was called "".

<a href="Lay%20abbot">Lay abbot</a>s (M. Lat. ', ', ', ', ' or ', ', or sometimes simply ') were the outcome of the growth of the <a href="Feudalism">feudal</a> system from the 8th century onwards. The practice of <a href="commendation">commendation</a>, by which—to meet a contemporary emergency—the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord, in return for his protection,
early suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held "in <a href="commendam">commendam</a>."

During the Carolingian epoch, the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable <a href="fiefdom">fiefs</a> or <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s, and by the 10th century, before the great <a href="Cluniac">Cluniac</a> reform, the system was firmly established. Even the <a href="Saint%20Denis%20Basilica">abbey of St Denis</a> was held in commendam by <a href="Hugh%20Capet">Hugh Capet</a>. The example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles, sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent, sometimes without any form of commendation whatever. In England the abuse was rife in the 8th century, as may be gathered from the acts of the <a href="council%20of%20Cloveshoe">council of Cloveshoe</a>. These lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions. The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other. The <a href="enfeoffment">enfeoffment</a> of abbeys differed in form and degree. Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as <a href="dean%20%28religion%29">dean</a> (decanus), but also as abbot ("abbas legitimas", "monasticus", "regularis").

When the great reform of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots, the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families, as late as the 13th century and later, with the head of the community retaining the title of dean. The connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys, especially in the south of France, lasted longer; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers (abbates milltes) for centuries, together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues. The abuse was not confined to the West. John, <a href="patriarch%20of%20Antioch">patriarch of Antioch</a>, at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen, "bencficiarii," for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.

<a href="Giraldus%20Cambrensis">Giraldus Cambrensis</a> reported ("Itinerary", ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:
In conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a <a href="prior">prior</a>.

In the Roman Catholic Church, abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term (some orders of monks, as the <a href="Carthusians">Carthusians</a> for instance, have no abbots, only <a href="prior">prior</a>s). A monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the Pope, and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability—a certain number of monks in vows, a certain number of years of establishment, a certain firmness to the foundation in economic, vocational and legal aspects. Prior to this, the monastery would be a mere priory, headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has.
The abbot is chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks. Once chosen, he must request blessing: the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or, with his permission, another abbot or bishop. The ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop, with the new abbot being presented with the <a href="mitre">mitre</a>, the ring, and the <a href="crosier">crosier</a> as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant. Though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority, it does not confer further sacramental authority- it is not a further degree of Holy Orders (although some abbots have been ordained to the episcopacy).

Once he has received this blessing, the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense, but their major superior under canon law, and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector (formerly, he could confer the minor orders, which are not sacraments, that these ministries have replaced). The abbey is a species of "exempt religious" in that it is, for the most part, answerable to the Pope, or to the abbot primate, rather than to the local bishop.

The abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks, though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross.

<a href="Territorial%20abbot">Territorial abbot</a>s follow all of the above, but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the Pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible.

In some monastic families, there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots. In some cases, this is the result of an abbey being considered the "mother" of several "daughter" abbeys founded as dependent priories of the "mother." In other cases, abbeys have affiliated in networks known as "congregations." Some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order.


The title <a href="abb%C3%A9">abbé</a> (French; Ital. "abate"), as commonly used in the Catholic Church on the European continent, is the equivalent of the English "Father" (parallel etymology), being loosely applied to all who have received the <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a>. This use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of France, by the <a href="concordat">concordat</a> between <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a> and <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a> (1516), to appoint "abbés commendataires" to most of the abbeys in France. The expectation of obtaining these <a href="sinecure">sinecure</a>s drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers, and the class of abbés so formed—"abbés de cour" they were sometimes called, and sometimes (ironically) "abbés de sainte espérance", (abbés of holy hope; or the <a href="jeu%20de%20mots">jeu de mots</a>, of St. Hope)—came to hold a recognized position. The connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind, consisting mainly in adopting the title of abbé, after a remarkably moderate course of theological study, practising <a href="celibacy">celibacy</a> and wearing a distinctive dress—a short dark-violet coat with narrow collar. Being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure, many of the class found admission to the houses of the French nobility as tutors or advisers. Nearly every great family had its abbé. The class did not survive the <a href="French%20Revolution">Revolution</a>; but the <a href="courtesy%20title">courtesy title</a> of abbé, having long lost all connection in people's minds with any special ecclesiastical function, remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman.

In the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Catholic%20Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a>, the abbot is referred to as the "hegumen". The Superior of a convent of nuns is called the "Hēguménē". The title of "archimandrite" (literally the head of the enclosure) used to mean something similar.

In the East, the principle set forth in the "<a href="Corpus%20Juris%20Civilis">Corpus Juris Civilis</a>" still applies, whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop. Those monasteries which enjoy the status of being "stauropegiac" will be subject only to a <a href="Primate%20%28bishop%29">primate</a> or his <a href="Synod">Synod</a> of Bishops and not the local bishop.

Although currently in the Western Church the title "abbot" is given only abbots of monasteries, the title archimandrite is given to "monastics" (i.e., celibate) priests in the East, even when not attached to a monastery, as an honor for service, similar to the title of <a href="monsignor">monsignor</a> in the Western/Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. In the <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a>, only monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of archimandrite. Married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of <a href="Archpriest">Archpriest</a> or <a href="Protopresbyter">Protopresbyter</a>. Normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the Orthodox Church, with the exception of married priests who have been <a href="widow">widow</a>ed. Since the time of <a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Catherine II</a> the ranks of Abbot and Archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the Russian Church, and may be given to any monastic, even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery. In Greek practice the title or function of Abbot corresponds to a person who serves as the head of a monastery, although the title of the Archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery.

In the <a href="Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Germany">German Evangelical Church</a>, the German title of "Abt" (abbot) is sometimes bestowed, like the French "abbé", as an honorary distinction, and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the Reformation into collegiate foundations.
Of these the most noteworthy is <a href="Loccum%20Abbey">Loccum Abbey</a> in <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, founded as a <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> house in 1163 by Count Wilbrand of Hallermund, and reformed in 1593. The abbot of Loccum, who still carries a pastoral staff, takes precedence over all the clergy of Hanover, and was "ex officio" a member of the <a href="wiktionary%3Aconsistory">consistory</a> of the kingdom. The governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot, prior and the "convent" of "<a href="Stiftsherr">Stiftsherr</a>en" (canons).

In the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, by royal decree given by <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>, also holds the honorary title of "Abbot of St. Benet." This title hails back to England's separation from the See of Rome, when King Henry, as supreme head of the newly independent church, took over all of the monasteries, mainly for their possessions, except for St. Benet, which he spared because the abbot and his monks possessed no wealth, and lived like simple beggars, deposing the incumbent Bishop of Norwich and seating the abbot in his place, thus the dual title still held to this day.

Additionally, at the <a href="enthronement">enthronement</a> of the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, there is a threefold enthronement, once in the throne the chancel as the <a href="diocesan%20bishop">diocesan bishop</a> of <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, once in the <a href="Chair%20of%20St.%20Augustine">Chair of St. Augustine</a> as the <a href="Primate%20of%20All%20England">Primate of All England</a>, and then once in the chapter-house as Titular Abbot of Canterbury.

There are several Benedictine Abbeys throughout the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>. Most of them have mitred abbots.

"The Abbot" is one of the archetypes traditionally illustrated in scenes of "<a href="Danse%20Macabre">Danse Macabre</a>".

The lives of numerous abbots make up a significant contribution to Christian <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a>, one of the most well-known being the "Life of St. <a href="Benedict%20of%20Nursia">Benedict of Nursia</a>" by St. <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a>.

During the years 1106–1107 A.D., a Russian Orthodox abbot named Daniel made a <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> and recorded his experiences. His diary was much-read throughout <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, and at least seventy-five manuscript copies survive. <a href="Joseph%20Volotsky">Saint Joseph</a>, Abbot of <a href="Volokolamsk">Volokolamsk</a>, Russia (1439–1515), wrote a number of influential works against <a href="heresy">heresy</a>, and about monastic and liturgical discipline, and Christian <a href="philanthropy">philanthropy</a>.

In the <a href="Redwall">"Tales of Redwall" series</a>, the creatures of Redwall are led by an Abbot or Abbess. These "abbots" are appointed by the brothers and sisters of Redwall to serve as a superior and provide paternal care, much like real abbots.

"The Abbot" was a nickname of <a href="RZA">RZA</a> from the <a href="Wu-Tang%20Clan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>.

Ardipithecus

Ardipithecus is a genus of an extinct <a href="hominine">hominine</a> that lived during <a href="Late%20Miocene">Late Miocene</a> and <a href="Early%20Pliocene">Early Pliocene</a> in <a href="Afar%20Depression">Afar Depression</a>, <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. Originally described as one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the main ape lineage, the relation of this <a href="genus">genus</a> to human ancestors and whether it is a <a href="hominin">hominin</a> is now a matter of debate. Two fossil <a href="species">species</a> are described in the literature: "A. ramidus", which lived about 4.4 million years ago during the early <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, and "A. kadabba", dated to approximately 5.6 million years ago (late <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>). Behavioral analysis showed that "Ardipithecus" could be very similar to <a href="chimpanzees">chimpanzees</a>, indicating that the early human ancestors were very chimpanzee-like in behaviour.

"A. ramidus" was named in September 1994. The first fossil found was dated to 4.4 million years ago on the basis of its stratigraphic position between two volcanic <a href="stratum">strata</a>: the basal <a href="Tuff">Gaala Tuff Complex</a> (G.A.T.C.) and the <a href="basalt">Daam Aatu Basaltic Tuff</a> (D.A.B.T.). The name "Ardipithecus ramidus" stems mostly from the <a href="Afar%20language">Afar language</a>, in which "Ardi" means "ground/floor" (borrowed from the Semitic root in either Amharic or Arabic) and "ramid" means "root". The "pithecus" portion of the name is from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word for "ape".

Like most hominids, but unlike all previously recognized hominins, it had a grasping <a href="hallux">hallux</a> or big toe adapted for locomotion in the trees. It is not confirmed how much other features of its skeleton reflect adaptation to <a href="bipedalism">bipedalism</a> on the ground as well. Like later hominins, "Ardipithecus" had reduced <a href="canine%20teeth">canine teeth</a>.

In 1992–1993 a research team headed by <a href="Tim%20D.%20White">Tim White</a> discovered the first "A. ramidus" fossils—seventeen fragments including skull, mandible, teeth and arm bones—from the <a href="Afar%20Depression">Afar Depression</a> in the <a href="Middle%20Awash">Middle Awash</a> river valley of <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. More fragments were recovered in 1994, amounting to 45% of the total skeleton. This fossil was originally described as a species of "<a href="Australopithecus">Australopithecus</a>", but White and his colleagues later published a note in the same journal renaming the fossil under a new genus, "Ardipithecus". Between 1999 and 2003, a multidisciplinary team led by <a href="Sileshi%20Semaw">Sileshi Semaw</a> discovered bones and teeth of nine "A. ramidus" individuals at <a href="As%20Duma">As Duma</a> in the <a href="Gona">Gona</a> Western Margin of Ethiopia's <a href="Afar%20Region">Afar Region</a>. The fossils were dated to between 4.35 and 4.45 million years old.

"Ardipithecus ramidus" had a small brain, measuring between 300 and 350 cm. This is slightly smaller than a modern <a href="bonobo">bonobo</a> or female <a href="common%20chimpanzee">common chimpanzee</a> brain, but much smaller than the brain of <a href="Australopithecus">australopithecines</a> like Lucy (~400 to 550 cm) and roughly 20% the size of the modern "Homo sapiens" brain. Like common chimpanzees, "A. ramidus" was much more <a href="Prognathism">prognathic</a> than modern humans.

The teeth of "A. ramidus" lacked the specialization of other apes, and suggest that it was a generalized <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a> and <a href="frugivore">frugivore</a> (fruit eater) with a diet that did not depend heavily on foliage, fibrous plant material (roots, tubers, etc.), or hard and or abrasive food. The size of the upper <a href="canine%20tooth">canine tooth</a> in "A. ramidus" males was not distinctly different from that of females. Their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size, as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth. The features of the upper canine in "A. ramidus" contrast with the <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> observed in common chimpanzees, where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canine teeth than females.

The less pronounced nature of the upper canine teeth in "A. ramidus" has been used to infer aspects of the <a href="Primatology%23Primatology%20in%20sociobiology">social behavior</a> of the species and more ancestral hominids. In particular, it has been used to suggest that the <a href="last%20common%20ancestor">last common ancestor</a> of hominids and African apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups. This is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees, among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high. Researchers in a 2009 study said that this condition "compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition."

"A. ramidus" existed more recently than the <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> of humans and chimpanzees (<a href="Chimpanzee-human%20last%20common%20ancestor">CLCA or "Pan"-"Homo" LCA</a>) and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor. Nevertheless, it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees, suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee. After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; "A. ramidus" feet are better suited for walking. The canine teeth of "A. ramidus" are smaller, and equal in size between males and females, which suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, increased pair-bonding, and increased parental investment. "Thus, fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools," the research team concluded.

On October 1, <a href="2009%20in%20science">2009</a>, paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete "A. ramidus" fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994. The fossil is the remains of a small-brained 50-kilogram (110 lb) female, nicknamed "Ardi", and includes most of the skull and teeth, as well as the pelvis, hands, and feet. It was discovered in Ethiopia's harsh <a href="Afar%20Region">Afar desert</a> at a site called <a href="Aramis%2C%20Ethiopia">Aramis</a> in the Middle Awash region. Radiometric dating of the layers of volcanic ash encasing the deposits suggest that Ardi lived about 4.3-4.5 million years ago. This date, however, has been questioned by others. Fleagle and Kappelman suggest that the region in which Ardi was found is difficult to date radiometrically, and they argue that Ardi should be dated at 3.9 million years.<ref name="10.1038/nature09709"></ref>

The fossil is regarded by its describers as shedding light on a stage of human evolution about which little was known, more than a million years before <a href="Lucy%20%28Australopithecus%29">Lucy</a> ("Australopithecus afarensis"), the iconic early human ancestor candidate who lived 3.2 million years ago, and was discovered in 1974 just away from Ardi's discovery site. However, because the "Ardi" skeleton is no more than 200,000 years older than the earliest fossils of "Australopithecus", and may in fact be younger than they are, some researchers doubt that it can represent a direct ancestor of "Australopithecus".

Some researchers infer from the form of her pelvis and limbs and the presence of her <a href="Abduction%20%28kinesiology%29">abductable</a> <a href="hallux">hallux</a>, that "Ardi" was a <a href="facultative%20biped">facultative biped</a>: <a href="biped">biped</a>al when moving on the ground, but <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>al when moving about in tree branches. "A. ramidus" had a more primitive walking ability than later hominids, and could not walk or run for long distances. The teeth suggest <a href="omnivory">omnivory</a>, and are more generalised than those of modern apes.

"Ardipithecus kadabba" is "known only from teeth and bits and pieces of skeletal bones", and is dated to approximately 5.6 million years ago. It has been described as a "probable <a href="chronospecies">chronospecies</a>" (i.e. ancestor) of "A. ramidus". Although originally considered a subspecies of "A. ramidus", in 2004 anthropologists <a href="Yohannes%20Haile-Selassie">Yohannes Haile-Selassie</a>, <a href="Gen%20Suwa">Gen Suwa</a>, and <a href="Tim%20D.%20White">Tim D. White</a> published an article elevating "A. kadabba" to species level on the basis of newly discovered teeth from <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. These teeth show "primitive morphology and wear pattern" which demonstrate that "A. kadabba" is a distinct species from "A. ramidus".

The specific name comes from the <a href="Afar%20language">Afar</a> word for "basal family ancestor".

The toe and pelvic structure of "A. ramidus" suggest to some researchers that the organism walked erect.

According to <a href="Scott%20Simpson%20%28anthropologist%29">Scott Simpson</a>, the Gona Project's <a href="biological%20anthropology">physical anthropologist</a>, the fossil evidence from the <a href="Middle%20Awash">Middle Awash</a> indicates that both "A. kadabba" and "A. ramidus" lived in "a mosaic of woodland and grasslands with lakes, swamps and springs nearby," but further research is needed to determine which habitat "Ardipithecus" at Gona preferred.

Due to several shared characters with chimpanzees, its closeness to ape divergence period, and due to its fossil incompleteness, the exact position of "Ardipithecus" in the fossil record is a subject of controversy. Independent researcher such as Esteban E. Sarmiento of the Human Evolution Foundation in New Jersey, had systematically compared in 2010 the identifying characters of apes and human ancestral fossils in relation to "Ardipithecus", and concluded that the comparison data is not sufficient to support an exclusive human lineage. Sarmiento noted that "Ardipithecus" does not share any characters exclusive to humans and some of its characters (those in the wrist and basicranium) suggest it diverged from the common human/African ape stock prior to the human, chimpanzee and gorilla divergence His comparative (narrow <a href="allometry">allometry</a>) study in 2011 on the molar and body segment lengths (which included living primates of similar body size) noted that some dimensions including short upper limbs, and <a href="metacarpals">metacarpals</a> are reminiscent of humans, but other dimensions such as long toes and relative molar surface area are great ape-like. Sarmiento concluded that such length measures can change back and forth during evolution and are not very good indicators of relatedness. The "Ardipithecus" length measures, however, are good indicators of function and together with dental isotope data and the fauna and flora from the fossil site indicate "Ardipithecus" was mainly a terrestrial quadruped collecting a large portion of its food on the ground. Its arboreal behaviors would have been limited and suspension from branches solely from the upper limbs rare.

However, some later studies still argue for its classification in the human lineage. Comparative study in 2013 on carbon and oxygen stable isotopes within modern and fossil <a href="tooth%20enamel">tooth enamel</a> revealed that "Ardipithecus" fed both <a href="Arboreal%20locomotion">arboreally</a> (on trees) and on the ground in a more open habitat, unlike chimpanzees and extinct ape "<a href="Sivapithecus">Sivapithecus</a>", thereby differentiating them from other apes. In 2014 it was reported that the hand bones of "Ardipithecus", "<a href="Australopithecus%20sediba">Australopithecus sediba</a>" and "<a href="A.%20afarensis">A. afarensis</a>" consist of distinct human-lineage feature (which is the presence of third metacarpal <a href="Styloid%20process%20%28radius%29">styloid process</a>, that is absent in other ape lineages). Unique brain organisations (such as lateral shift of the carotid foramina, mediolateral abbreviation of the lateral <a href="Tympanic%20cavity">tympanic</a>, and a shortened, trapezoidal <a href="Occipital%20lobe">basioccipital</a> element) in "Ardipithecus" are also found only "Australopithecus" and "Homo" clade. Comparison of the tooth root morphology with those of "<a href="Sahelanthropus%20tchadensis">Sahelanthropus tchadensis</a>" also indicated strong resemblance, implying its correct inclusion in human lineage.

In a study that assumes the hominin status of "Ardipithecus ramidus", it has been argued the species represents a <a href="Heterochrony">heterochronic</a> alteration of the more general great ape body plan. In this study the resemblance of the species' craniofacial moprhology with that of subadult chimpanzees is attributed to dissociation of craniofacial growth from brain growth and associated life history trajectories such as eruption of the first molar and age of first birth. Consequently, it is argued the species represents a unique ontogeny unlike any extant ape. The reduced growth in the sub-nasal alveolar region of the face, which houses the projecting canine complex in chimpanzees, suggests the species had rates of growth and reproductive biology unlike any living primate species. In this sense the species may show the first trend towards human social, parenting and sexual psychology. Consequently, the authors argue it is no longer tenable to extrapolate from chimpanzees in reconstructions of early hominin social and mating behaviour, providing further evidence against the so-called 'chimpanzee referential model'. As the authors write when discussing the species unusual pattern of cranio-dental growth and the light it may throw on the origins of human sociality:

'The contrast [of humans] with chimpanzees is instructive, for when humans start developing broader social bonds after the permanent dentition begins erupting, at the same developmental milestone, chimpanzee facial projection increases. In other words, humans seem to have replaced craniofacial growth with an extended and intensified period of socio-emotional development. As "A. ramidus" no longer has an ontogeny that results in the development of a prognathic jaw with a C/P3 complex (which is one of the most important means by which males vie for status within the mating hierarchies of other primate species), young and sub-adult members of the species must have pursued other avenues by which to become reproductively successful members of the social group. The implication of these interspecific differences is that "A. ramidus" would have most likely had a period of infant and juvenile socialisation different from that of chimpanzees. Consequently, it is possible that in "A.ramidus" we see the first, albeit incipient trend toward human forms of child socialisation and social organisation'.

It should be noted that this view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the ontogeny of "A.ramidus". The study also provides support for Stephen Jay Gould's theory in <a href="Ontogeny%20and%20Phylogeny%20%28book%29">"Ontogeny and Phylogeny"</a> that the paedomorphic form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from heterochronic dissociation of growth trajectories.

A study published in "Homo: Journal of Comparative Human Biology" in 2017 claims that "A.ramidus" possessed an ontogeny and idiosyncratic skull morphology more conducive to the production of modulated vocalisations than any other species of extant great ape. This paper argued that erect posture, significant cervical lordosis, reduced facial projection as well as "flexed" cranial base architecture indicate this species possessed greater facility to modulate vocalisations than both chimpanzees and bonobos. This is a controversial finding as it pushes language origins back some 4.5Ma into the late Miocene and early Pliocene suggesting that human vocal capability may have much deeper roots in the hominin lineage than traditionally supposed. In integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production, the authors argue that paleoanthropologists to date have failed to grasp the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and language capacity. As they write:

While the skull of "A.ramidus", according to the authors, lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees, it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were. While they suggest "A.ramidus" - based on similar vocal tract ratios - may have had vocal capabilities equivalent to a modern human infant or very young child, they concede this is obviously a debatable and specualtive hypothesis. However, they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were a necessary prerequisite for language evolution. As they write:

Assembly line

An assembly line is a <a href="manufacturing">manufacturing</a> process (most of the time called a "progressive assembly") in which parts (usually <a href="interchangeable%20parts">interchangeable parts</a>) are added as the semi-finished assembly moves from workstation to workstation where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced. By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly.

Assembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as <a href="automobile">automobile</a>s and other <a href="transportation">transportation</a> equipment, <a href="household">household</a> appliances and <a href="Consumer%20electronics">electronic goods</a>.

Assembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of <a href="worker">worker</a>s, <a href="tool">tool</a>s or machines, and parts. The motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible. All parts or assemblies are handled either by <a href="conveyor">conveyor</a>s or motorized vehicles such as <a href="fork%20lifts">fork lifts</a>, or <a href="gravity">gravity</a>, with no manual trucking. Heavy lifting is done by machines such as <a href="overhead%20crane">overhead crane</a>s or fork lifts. Each worker typically performs one simple operation.

According to <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>:

Consider the assembly of a <a href="car">car</a>: assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine, install the hood, and install the wheels (in that order, with arbitrary interstitial steps); only one of these steps can be done at a time. In traditional production, only one car would be assembled at a time. If <a href="engine">engine</a> installation takes 20 minutes, <a href="Hood%20%28vehicle%29">hood</a> installation takes five minutes, and <a href="wheel">wheel</a>s installation takes 10 minutes, then a car can be produced every 35 minutes.

In an assembly line, car assembly is split between several stations, all working simultaneously. When one station is finished with a car, it passes it on to the next. By having three stations, a total of three different cars can be operated on at the same time, each one at a different stage of its assembly.

After finishing its work on the first car, the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car. While the engine installation crew works on the second car, the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood, then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels. After the engine has been installed on the second car, the second car moves to the hood assembly. At the same time, the third car moves to the engine assembly. When the third car’s engine has been mounted, it then can be moved to the hood station; meanwhile, subsequent cars (if any) can be moved to the engine installation station.

Assuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another, the longest stage on the assembly line determines the <a href="throughput%20%28business%29">throughput</a> (20 minutes for the engine installation) so a car can be produced every 20 minutes, once the first car taking 35 minutes has been produced.

Before the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, most manufactured products were made individually by hand. A single <a href="Artisan">craftsman</a> or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product. They would use their skills and tools such as <a href="File%20%28tool%29">files</a> and <a href="knives">knives</a> to create the individual parts. They would then assemble them into the final product, making cut-and-try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together (<a href="craft%20production">craft production</a>).

<a href="Division%20of%20labor">Division of labor</a> was practiced in China where state run monopolies <a href="mass-produced">mass-produced</a> metal agricultural implements, china, armor,and weapons centuries before it appeared in Europe on the eve of the Industrial Revolution. <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a> discussed the <a href="division%20of%20labour">division of labour</a> in the manufacture of <a href="pins">pins</a> at length in his book "<a href="The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a>" (published in 1776).

The <a href="Venetian%20Arsenal">Venetian Arsenal</a>, dating to about 1104, operated similar to a production line. Ships moved down a canal and were fitted by the various shops they passed. At the peak of its <a href="efficiency">efficiency</a> in the early 16th century, the <a href="Venetian%20Arsenal">Venetian Arsenal</a> employed some 16,000 people who could apparently produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly built <a href="galley">galley</a> with standardized parts on an assembly-line basis. Although the Venice Arsenal lasted until the early <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, production line methods did not become common even then.

The <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> led to a proliferation of manufacturing and invention. Many industries, notably <a href="textile">textile</a>s, <a href="firearm">firearm</a>s, <a href="clockmaking">clocks and watches</a>, <a href="horse-drawn%20vehicle">horse-drawn vehicle</a>s, <a href="Locomotive">railway locomotive</a>s, <a href="sewing%20machine">sewing machine</a>s, and <a href="bicycle">bicycle</a>s, saw expeditious improvement in materials handling, machining, and assembly during the 19th century, although modern concepts such as <a href="industrial%20engineering">industrial engineering</a> and <a href="logistics">logistics</a> had not yet been named.

The automatic <a href="flour">flour</a> <a href="Mill%20%28grinding%29">mill</a> built by <a href="Oliver%20Evans">Oliver Evans</a> in 1785 was called the beginning of modern <a href="bulk%20material%20handling">bulk material handling</a> by Roe (1916). Evans's mill used a leather belt bucket elevator, <a href="screw%20conveyor">screw conveyor</a>s, canvas belt conveyors, and other mechanical devices to completely automate the process of making flour. The innovation spread to other mills and breweries.

Probably the earliest industrial example of a linear and continuous assembly process is the <a href="Portsmouth%20Block%20Mills">Portsmouth Block Mills</a>, built between 1801 and 1803. <a href="Marc%20Isambard%20Brunel">Marc Isambard Brunel</a> (father of <a href="Isambard%20Kingdom%20Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a>), with the help of <a href="Henry%20Maudslay">Henry Maudslay</a> and others, designed 22 types of machine tools to make the parts for the rigging <a href="Block%20%28sailing%29">blocks</a> used by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. This factory was so successful that it remained in use until the 1960s, with the workshop still visible at <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">HM Dockyard</a> in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, and still containing some of the original machinery.

One of the earliest examples of an almost modern factory layout, designed for easy material handling, was the <a href="Nasmyth%2C%20Gaskell%20and%20Company">Bridgewater Foundry</a>. The factory grounds were bordered by the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> and the <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>. The buildings were arranged in a line with a railway for carrying the work going through the buildings. <a href="Crane%20%28machine%29">Crane</a>s were used for lifting the heavy work, which sometimes weighed in the tens of tons. The work passed sequentially through to erection of framework and final assembly.

The first flow assembly line was initiated at the factory of <a href="Richard%20Garrett%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Richard Garrett & Sons</a>, Leiston Works in <a href="Leiston">Leiston</a> in the <a href="English%20county">English county</a> of <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> for the manufacture of <a href="portable%20steam%20engine">portable steam engine</a>s. The assembly line area was called '<a href="Long%20Shop%20Museum">The Long Shop</a>' on account of its length and was fully operational by early 1853. The <a href="boiler">boiler</a> was brought up from the foundry and put at the start of the line, and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added. From the upper level, where other parts were made, the lighter parts would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level. When the machine reached the end of the shop, it would be completed.

During the early 19th century, the development of <a href="machine%20tool">machine tool</a>s such as the <a href="screw-cutting%20lathe">screw-cutting lathe</a>, <a href="Planer%20%28metalworking%29">metal planer</a>, and <a href="milling%20machine">milling machine</a>, and of toolpath control via <a href="Jig%20%28tool%29">jigs</a> and <a href="Fixture%20%28tool%29">fixtures</a>, provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making <a href="interchangeable%20parts">interchangeable parts</a> a practical reality.

Steam powered <a href="conveyor%20lift">conveyor lift</a>s began being used for loading and unloading ships some time in the last quarter of the 19th century. Hounshell (1984) shows a sketch of an electric powered conveyor moving cans through a filling line in a canning factory.

The <a href="meatpacking">meatpacking</a> industry of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> is believed to be one of the first industrial assembly lines (or dis-assembly lines) to be utilized in the United States starting in 1867. Workers would stand at fixed stations and a pulley system would bring the meat to each worker and they would complete one task. Henry Ford and others have written about the influence of this <a href="slaughterhouse">slaughterhouse</a> practice on the later developments at Ford Motor Company.

According to Domm, the implementation of mass production of an automobile via an assembly line may be credited to <a href="Ransom%20Olds">Ransom Olds</a>, who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the <a href="Oldsmobile%20Curved%20Dash">Oldsmobile Curved Dash</a>. Olds <a href="patented">patented</a> the assembly line concept, which he put to work in his <a href="Olds%20Motor%20Vehicle%20Company">Olds Motor Vehicle Company</a> factory in 1901.

At <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a>, the assembly line concept appears to have been introduced by William "Pa" Klann upon his return from visiting <a href="Gustavus%20Franklin%20Swift">Swift & Company's slaughterhouse</a> in Chicago and viewing what was referred to as the "disassembly line", where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor. The efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over without himself moving caught his attention. He reported the idea to <a href="Peter%20E.%20Martin">Peter E. Martin</a>, soon to be head of Ford production, who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed. Others at Ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>, but Pa Klann's slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the Henry Ford Museum and elsewhere, making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept. Ford was appreciative, having visited the highly automated 40-acre <a href="Sears">Sears</a> <a href="mail%20order">mail order</a> handling facility around 1906. At Ford, the process was an evolution by trial and error of a team consisting primarily of <a href="Peter%20E.%20Martin">Peter E. Martin</a>, the factory superintendent; <a href="Charles%20E.%20Sorensen">Charles E. Sorensen</a>, Martin's assistant; <a href="Clarence%20W.%20Avery">Clarence W. Avery</a>; <a href="C.%20Harold%20Wills">C. Harold Wills</a>, draftsman and toolmaker; <a href="Charles%20Ebender">Charles Ebender</a>; and <a href="J%C3%B3zsef%20Galamb">József Galamb</a>. Some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of <a href="machine%20tool">machine tool</a> placement that <a href="Walter%20Flanders">Walter Flanders</a> had been doing at Ford up to 1908.

The moving assembly line was developed for the <a href="Ford%20Model%20T">Ford Model T</a> and began operation on October 7, 1913, at the <a href="Highland%20Park%20Ford%20Plant">Highland Park Ford Plant</a>, and continued to evolve after that, using <a href="time%20and%20motion%20study">time and motion study</a>. The assembly line, driven by <a href="conveyor%20belts">conveyor belts</a>, reduced production time for a <a href="Model%20T">Model T</a> to just 93 minutes by dividing the process into 45 steps. Producing cars quicker than paint of the day could dry, it had an immense influence on the world.

In 1922 Ford (through his ghostwriter Crowther) said of his 1913 assembly line:

<a href="Charles%20E.%20Sorensen">Charles E. Sorensen</a>, in his 1956 memoir "My Forty Years with Ford", presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual “inventors” as a gradual, logical development of <a href="industrial%20engineering">industrial engineering</a>:

As a result of these developments in method, Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, or six feet per minute. This was much faster than previous methods, increasing production by eight to one (requiring 12.5 man-hours before, 1 hour 33 minutes after), while using less manpower. It was so successful, <a href="paint">paint</a> became a bottleneck. Only <a href="japan%20black">japan black</a> would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying <a href="Duco">Duco</a> <a href="lacquer">lacquer</a> was developed in 1926.

The assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into American society. Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to fall within the budget of the American middle class. In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had decreased to around $575. This price reduction is comparable to a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000. In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.

Ford's complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of <a href="injury">injury</a>. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called "<a href="Fordism">Fordism</a>", and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take-off of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.

In the <a href="automotive%20industry">automotive industry</a>, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide. Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany and Ford Japan 1925; in 1919, Vulcan (Southport, Lancashire) was the first native European manufacturer to adopt it. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke by not being able to compete; by 1930, 250 companies which did not had disappeared.

The massive demand for military hardware in World War II prompted assembly-line techniques in shipbuilding and aircraft production. Thousands of <a href="Liberty%20Ship">Liberty Ship</a>s were built making extensive use of prefabrication, enabling ship assembly to be completed in weeks or even days. After having produced fewer than 3,000 planes for the United States Military in 1939, American aircraft manufacturers built over 300,000 planes in World War II. <a href="Vultee">Vultee</a> pioneered the use of the powered assembly line for aircraft manufacturing. Other companies quickly followed. As <a href="William%20S.%20Knudsen">William S. Knudsen</a> (having worked at Ford, GM and the National Defense Advisory Commission) observed, "We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible."

In his 1922 autobiography, Henry Ford mentions several benefits of the assembly line including:


The gains in <a href="productivity">productivity</a> allowed Ford to increase worker pay from $1.50 per day to $5.00 per day once employees reached three years of service on the assembly line. Ford continued on to reduce the hourly work week while continuously lowering the Model T price. These goals appear altruistic; however, it has been argued that they were implemented by Ford in order to reduce high employee turnover: when the assembly line was introduced in 1913, it was discovered that “every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963” in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired.

<a href="Sociology">Sociological</a> work has explored the <a href="social%20alienation">social alienation</a> and <a href="boredom">boredom</a> that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long.

One of capitalism's most famous critics, <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>, expressed in his "Entfremdung" theory the belief that in order to achieve job satisfaction workers need to see themselves in the objects they have created, that products should be "mirrors in which workers see their reflected essential nature." Marx viewed labour as a chance for us to externalize facets of our personality. Marxists argue that specialization makes it very difficult for any worker to feel they may be contributing to the real needs of humanity. The repetitive nature of specialized tasks causes, they say, a feeling of disconnection between what a worker does all day, who they really are, and what they would ideally be able to contribute to society. Marx also argued that specialised jobs are insecure, since the worker is expendable as soon as costs rise and technology can replace more expensive human labour.

Since workers have to stand in the same place for hours and repeat the same motion hundreds of times per day <a href="Repetitive%20strain%20injury">repetitive stress injuries</a> are a possible pathology of <a href="occupational%20safety">occupational safety</a>. <a href="Industrial%20noise">Industrial noise</a> also proved dangerous. When it was not too high, workers were often prohibited from talking. <a href="Charles%20Piaget">Charles Piaget</a>, a <a href="skilled%20worker">skilled worker</a> at the <a href="LIP%20factory">LIP factory</a>, recalled that beside being prohibited from speaking, the semi-skilled workers had only 25 centimeters in which to move. Industrial <a href="ergonomics">ergonomics</a> later tried to minimize physical trauma.
