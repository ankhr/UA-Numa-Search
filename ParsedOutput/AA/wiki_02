Aardvark

The aardvark ( ; "Orycteropus afer") is a medium-sized, burrowing, <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a> native to <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. It is the only living <a href="species">species</a> of the order <a href="Tubulidentata">Tubulidentata</a>, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike other <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s, it has a long <a href="pig">pig</a>-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a "least concern" rating from the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>, although its numbers seem to be decreasing.

The aardvark is sometimes colloquially called "African ant bear", "anteater" (not to be confused with the <a href="anteater">South American anteater</a>), or the "Cape anteater" after the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>. The name "aardvark" () comes from earlier <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> (erdvark) and means "earth <a href="pig">pig</a>" or "ground pig" ("aarde": earth/ground, "vark": pig), because of its burrowing habits (similar origin to the name <a href="groundhog">groundhog</a>). The name "Orycteropus" means burrowing foot, and the name "afer" refers to Africa. The name of the aardvarks's order, "Tubulidentata," comes from the tubule-style teeth.

The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Tubulidentata">Tubulidentata</a>, in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus "<a href="Orycteropus">Orycteropus</a>", the sole surviving genus in the family <a href="Orycteropodidae">Orycteropodidae</a>. The aardvark is not closely related to the <a href="South%20America">South America</a>n <a href="anteater">anteater</a>, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance. The similarities are based on <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the <a href="elephant%20shrew">elephant shrew</a>s, <a href="tenrecidae">tenrec</a>s and <a href="golden%20mole">golden mole</a>s. Along with the <a href="sirenian">sirenian</a>s, <a href="hyrax">hyrax</a>es, <a href="elephant">elephant</a>s, and their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder <a href="Afrotheria">Afrotheria</a>. Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with <a href="Condylarthra">Condylarthra</a>, and given the clade's status as a <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a> it may mean some species traditionally classified as "condylarths" are actually stem-aardvarks.

Based on fossils, Bryan Patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in <a href="Africa">Africa</a> around the end of the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>. The <a href="ptolemaiida">ptolemaiida</a>ns, a mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities, may actually be stem-aardvarks, either as a sister clade to <a href="Tubulidentata">Tubulidentata</a> or as a grade leading to true tubulidentates.

The first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably "<a href="Myorycteropus%20africanus">Myorycteropus africanus</a>" from <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>n <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> deposits. The earliest example from the "<a href="Orycteropus">Orycteropus</a>" genus was the "<a href="Orycteropus%20mauritanicus">Orycteropus mauritanicus</a>" found in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> in deposits from the middle Miocene, with an equally aged version found in Kenya. Fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years, and have been located throughout <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>.

The mysterious Pleistocene "<a href="Plesiorycteropus">Plesiorycteropus</a>" from <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>. However, a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that "Plesiorycteropus" is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark-like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution.

The aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed:


The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica also mentions "O. a. capensis" or Cape ant-bear from South Africa.

The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust <a href="Nail%20%28anatomy%29">nail</a> which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a <a href="claw">claw</a> and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered <a href="digitigrade">digitigrade</a>, it appears at time to be <a href="plantigrade">plantigrade</a>. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles.

An aardvark's weight is typically between . An aardvark's length is usually between , and can reach lengths of when its tail (which can be up to ) is taken into account. It is tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about . It is the <a href="Largest%20organisms">largest</a> member of the proposed clade <a href="Afroinsectiphilia">Afroinsectiphilia</a>. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by <a href="soil">soil</a>. The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. Its hair is short on its head and tail; however its legs tend to have longer hair. The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 hairs. The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs. Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.

The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>. The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their <a href="Tooth">teeth</a>. Instead of having a <a href="pulp%20%28tooth%29">pulp cavity</a>, each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of <a href="dentine">dentine</a>), with individual pulp canals, held together by <a href="cementum">cementum</a>. The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500. The teeth have no <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and <a href="canine%20tooth">canines</a> at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the <a href="jaw">jaw</a>, and have a <a href="dentition">dental formula</a> of: These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition. The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars. The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten <a href="nasal%20concha">nasal concha</a>e, more than any other placental mammal.

The sides of the nostrils are thick with hair. The tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified <a href="mimetic%20muscles">mimetic muscles</a>. The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions, but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature. Its nose is made up of more <a href="turbinate">turbinate</a> bones than any other mammal, with between 9 and 11, compared to dogs with 4 to 5. With a large quantity of turbinate bones, the aardvark has more space for the moist <a href="epithelium">epithelium</a>, which is the location of the olfactory bulb. The nose contains nine <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>s, more than any other mammal. Its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its <a href="olfactory%20lobe">olfactory lobe</a> is very developed. The snout resembles an elongated pig snout. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on <a href="ant">ant</a>s and <a href="termite">termite</a>s. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue (as much as long) and elaborate structures supporting a keen <a href="olfaction">sense of smell</a>. The ears, which are very effective, are disproportionately long, about long. The eyes are small for its head, and consist only of <a href="rod%20cell">rods</a>.

The aardvark's stomach has a muscular <a href="pyloric">pyloric</a> area that acts as a <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a> to grind swallowed food up, thereby rendering chewing unnecessary. Its <a href="cecum">cecum</a> is large. Both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland. Its <a href="salivary%20gland">salivary gland</a>s are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck; their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness. The female has two pairs of <a href="teat">teat</a>s in the inguinal region.

<a href="Gene">Gene</a>tically speaking, the aardvark is a <a href="living%20fossil">living fossil</a>, as its <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early <a href="eutherian">eutherian</a> arrangement before the divergence of the major modern <a href="taxon">taxa</a>.

Aardvarks are found in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, where suitable <a href="habitat">habitat</a> (<a href="savanna">savanna</a>s, <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s, <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s and <a href="bushland">bushland</a>) and food (i.e., <a href="ants">ants</a> and <a href="termites">termites</a>) is available. They spend the daylight hours in dark underground burrows to avoid the heat of the day. The only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest, as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth. They also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging. They have been documented as high as in Ethiopia. They are present throughout sub-Saharan Africa all the way to South Africa with few exceptions. These exceptions include the coastal areas of <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, and <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>. They are not found in Madagascar.

Aardvarks live for up to 23¬†years in <a href="captivity%20%28animal%29">captivity</a>. Its keen hearing warns it of predators: <a href="lion">lion</a>s, <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s, cheetahs, <a href="African%20wild%20dog">hunting dog</a>s, <a href="hyena">hyena</a>s, and <a href="pythonidae">pythons</a>. Some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat. Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet. They are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker. They will also dig to escape as they can, when pressed, dig extremely quickly. Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.

The aardvark is <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on <a href="ant">ant</a>s and <a href="termite">termite</a>s (<a href="formivore">formivore</a>); the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the <a href="aardvark%20cucumber">aardvark cucumber</a>. In fact, the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit, then defecate the seeds near their burrows, which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area. The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark. They avoid eating the African <a href="driver%20ant">driver ant</a> and red ants. Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large range to survive. An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing . While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5‚Äì8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again.

During a foraging period, they will stop and dig a "V" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of <a href="insect">insect</a>s with its long, sticky tongue‚Äîas many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils. When successful, the aardvark's long (up to ) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers. Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move, they can form columns long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals. The trampled grass and dung attract termites from <a href="Odontotermes">Odontotermes</a>, <a href="Microtermes">Microtermes</a>, and <a href="Pseudacanthotermes">Pseudacanthotermes</a> genera.

On a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time (20:00-00:00); however, they don't seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other. During adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems. They cover between per night; however, some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as in a night.

The aardvark is a rather quiet animal. However, it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance. It makes a bleating sound if frightened. When it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows. If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly. This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear.

The aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents. It can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes, but otherwise moves fairly slowly.

When leaving the burrow at night, they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes, sniffing and listening. After this period of watchfulness, it will bound out and within seconds it will be away. It will then pause, prick its ears, twisting its head to listen, then jump and move off to start foraging.

Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also <a href="fossorial">excavates</a> burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes. Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main <a href="burrow">burrow</a> is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as . These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter. The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one. The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the <a href="African%20Wild%20Dog">African wild dog</a>, <a href="ant-eating%20chat">ant-eating chat</a>, "<a href="Nycteris%20thebaica">Nycteris thebaica</a>" and <a href="warthog">warthog</a>s. Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season. Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature. If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws. The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated <a href="ant">ant</a> nest, which also serves as protection from its <a href="predator">predator</a>s.

Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a <a href="gestation">gestation</a> period of seven months, one cub weighing around is born during May‚ÄìJuly. When born, the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles. When nursing, it will nurse off each teat in succession. After two weeks, the folds of skin disappear and after three, the ears can be held upright. After 5‚Äì6 weeks, body hair starts growing. It is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks, is eating termites at 9¬†weeks, and is weaned between three months and 16¬†weeks. At six months of age, it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next <a href="mating%20season">mating season</a>, and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age.

Aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers, however, this is possibly due to the fact that they are not readily seen. There are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits; however, their numbers seem to be stable overall. They are not considered common anywhere in Africa, but due to their large range, they maintain sufficient numbers. There may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern, northern, and western Africa. Southern African numbers are not decreasing. It receives an official designation from the IUCN as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. However, they are a species in a precarious situation, as they are so dependent on such specific food; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites, the species as a whole would be affected drastically.

Aardvarks handle captivity well. The first zoo to have one was <a href="London%20Zoo">London Zoo</a> in 1869, which had an animal from <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.

In <a href="African%20folklore">African folklore</a>, the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to <a href="army%20ant">soldier ants</a>. <a href="Hausa%20people">Hausa</a> magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree. Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night. The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission. Also, some tribes, such as the <a href="Mangbetu%20people">Margbetu</a>, <a href="Ayanda">Ayanda</a>, and <a href="Logo%20people">Logo</a>, will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets, which are regarded as good luck charms. The meat, which has a resemblance to pork, is eaten in certain cultures.

The <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">Egyptian god</a> <a href="Set%20%28mythology%29">Set</a> is usually depicted with the head of an <a href="Set%20animal">unidentified animal</a>, whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship.

The titular character of "<a href="Arthur%20%28TV%20series%29">Arthur</a>", an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by <a href="WGBH-TV">WGBH</a>, shown in more than 180 countries, is an aardvark.

<a href="Otis%20the%20Aardvark">Otis the Aardvark</a> was a puppet character used on <a href="Children%27s%20BBC">Children's BBC</a> programming.

An aardvark features as the antagonist in the cartoon "<a href="The%20Ant%20and%20the%20Aardvark">The Ant and the Aardvark</a>" as well as in the Canadian animated series "<a href="The%20Raccoons">The Raccoons</a>".

In the military, the Air Force supersonic fighter-bomber <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111%20Aardvark">F-111/FB-111</a> was nicknamed the Aardvark because of its long nose resembling the animal. It also had similarities with its nocturnal missions flown at a very low level employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground. In the US Navy, the squadron <a href="VF-114">VF-114</a> was nicknamed the Aardvarks, flying <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">F-4</a>s and then <a href="Grumman%20F-14%20Tomcat">F-14</a>s. The squadron mascot was adapted from the animal in the comic strip "<a href="B.C.%20%28comic%20strip%29%23Animals%20and%20other%20non-human%20characters">B.C.</a>", which the F-4 was said to resemble.

Aardwolf

The aardwolf ("Proteles cristata") is a small, <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a>, native to <a href="East%20Africa">East</a> and <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a>. Its name means "earth wolf" in <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> and <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>. It is also called "maanhaar jackal" (Afrikaans for "<a href="mane%20%28lion%29">mane</a> jackal") or "civet hyena", based on its habit of secreting substances from its <a href="anal%20gland">anal gland</a>, a characteristic shared with the <a href="civet">civet</a>. The aardwolf is in the same family as the <a href="hyena">hyena</a>. Unlike many of its relatives in the order <a href="Carnivora">Carnivora</a>, the aardwolf does not hunt large <a href="animal">animal</a>s. It eats <a href="insect">insect</a>s, mainly <a href="termite">termite</a>s ‚Äì one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night, using its long, sticky <a href="tongue">tongue</a> to capture them. The aardwolf lives in the <a href="Shrubland">shrublands</a> of eastern and southern Africa ‚Äì open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. It is <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, resting in <a href="burrow">burrow</a>s during the day and emerging at night to seek food. Its diet consists mainly of termites and insect <a href="larva">larva</a>e.

The aardwolf is the only surviving species in the mammalian <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> Protelinae. There is disagreement as to whether the species is <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a>. or can be divided into <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> "P. c. cristatus" of <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a> and "P. c. septentrionalis" of <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a>. Recent studies have shown that the aardwolf probably broke away from the rest of the hyena family early on; however, how early is still unclear, as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by 10 million years.

The aardwolf is generally classified with the <a href="Hyaenidae">Hyaenidae</a>, though it was formerly placed into the family Protelidae. Early on, scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the <a href="striped%20hyena">striped hyena</a>, which subsequently led to the creation of Protelidae.

The <a href="genus">generic</a> name "proteles" comes from two words both of <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> origin, "protos" and "teleos" which combined means "complete in front" based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear. The specific name, "cristatus", comes from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and means "provided with a comb", relating to their mane.

The aardwolf resembles a very thin <a href="striped%20hyena">striped hyena</a>, but with a more slender <a href="snout">muzzle</a>, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct <a href="wikt%3Amane">mane</a> down the midline of the neck and back. It also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore- and hind-quarters, along with several stripes on its legs. The mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have. Its lower leg (from the knee down) is all black, and its tail is bushy with a black tip. The aardwolf is about long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about long, and stands about tall at the shoulders. An adult aardwolf weighs approximately , sometimes reaching . The aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller (about ), whereas the eastern version weighs more (around ). The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena. The teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas, though smaller, and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. It does still have canines, but, unlike other hyenas, these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense. Its ears, which are large, are very similar to those of the <a href="striped%20hyena">striped hyena</a>.

As an aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats.
Aardwolves live in open, dry plains and <a href="bushland">bushland</a>, avoiding mountainous areas. Due to their specific food requirements, they are only found in regions where termites of the family <a href="Hodotermitidae">Hodotermitidae</a> occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s and <a href="savannah">savannah</a>s, including <a href="arable%20land">farmland</a>. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.

There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary <a href="miombo">miombo</a> forests.

An adult pair, along with their most recent offspring, occupies a territory of .

Aardwolves are shy and <a href="nocturnal%20animal">nocturnal</a>, sleeping in underground burrows by day. They will, on occasion during the winter, become diurnal feeders. This happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat.

They have often been mistaken for solitary animals. In fact, they live as monogamous pairs with their young. If their territory is infringed upon, they will chase the intruder up to or to the border. If the intruder is caught, which rarely happens, a fight will occur, which is accompanied by soft clucking, hoarse barking, and a type of roar. The majority of incursions occur during mating season, when they can occur once or twice per week. When food is scarce, the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a "single territory".

The territory is marked by both sexes, as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in -long streaks. Aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad. They often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so. If they are patrolling their territorial boundaries, the marking frequency increases drastically, to once every . At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour, and upwards of 200 per night.

An aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens, and numerous <a href="midden">midden</a>s, within their territory. When they deposit feces at their middens, they dig a small hole and then cover it with sand. Their dens are usually abandoned <a href="aardvark">aardvark</a>, <a href="springhare">springhare</a>, or <a href="Old%20World%20porcupine">porcupine</a> dens, or on occasion they are crevices in rocks. They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by springhares. They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every six months. During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night, and sleep underground during the heat of the day.

Aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators. Therefore, when threatened, the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks. If confronted, it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing. It also emits a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands.

The aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on "<a href="Trinervitermes">Trinervitermes</a>". This genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf's range. In East Africa, they eat "T. bettonianus", and in central Africa, they eat "T. rhodesiensis", and finally in southern Africa, they eat "<a href="Trinervitermes%20trinervoides">T. trinervoides</a>". Their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the <a href="aardvark">aardvark</a>, which digs into the mound. They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites. An aardwolf may consume up to 250,000 <a href="termites">termites</a> per night using its sticky, long tongue. They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months. During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter, the primary termites become scarce, so the need for other foods becomes pronounced. During these times, the southern aardwolf will seek out "<a href="Hodotermes">Hodotermes</a> mossambicus", a type of <a href="harvester%20termite">harvester termite</a> active in the afternoon, which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter. The eastern aardwolf, during the rainy season, subsists on termites from the genera "<a href="Odontotermes">Odontotermes</a>" and "<a href="Macrotermes">Macrotermes</a>". They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs, and, some sources say, occasionally small mammals and birds, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet. Unlike other <a href="hyena">hyena</a>s, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals. Contrary to popular myths, aardwolves do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass, they are actually eating larvae and beetles. Also, contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely ground or cooked for them. The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups, but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers, necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, "Trinervitermes", forages in small but dense patches of . While foraging, the aardwolf can cover about per hour, which translates to per summer night and per winter night.

The <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a> varies depending on location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. In South Africa, breeding occurs in early July. During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with. Dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves, which can result in conflict between rival males. Dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches, they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males' territories. As the female comes into <a href="oestrus">oestrus</a>, they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories, sometimes doing so more in rivals' territories than their own. Females will also, when given the opportunity, mate with the dominant male, which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding "his" cubs with her. <a href="Copulation%20%28zoology%29">Copulation</a> lasts between 1 and 4.5 hours. <a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> lasts between 89 and 92 days, producing two to five <a href="List%20of%20animal%20names">cubs</a> (most often two or three) during the rainy season (November‚ÄìDecember), when termites are more active. They are born with their eyes open, but initially are helpless, and weigh around . The first six to eight weeks are spent in the <a href="Burrow">den</a> with their parents. The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food. After three months, they begin supervised foraging, and by four months are normally independent, though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season. By the time the next set of cubs is born, the older cubs have moved on. Aardwolves generally achieve <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> at one and a half to two years of age.

The aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and they are relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa. They are not common throughout their range, as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer, if the food is good. Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the aardwolf as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. In some areas, they are persecuted by man because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock; however, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental. In other areas, the farmers have recognized this, but they are still killed, on occasion, for their fur. Dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the aardwolf.

Aardwolfs are common sights at zoos. <a href="Frankfurt%20Zoo">Frankfurt Zoo</a> in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> was home to the oldest recorded aardwolf in captivity at 18 years and 11 months.

Adobe

Adobe (, ; ) is a building material made from earth and often organic material. Adobe means <a href="mudbrick">mudbrick</a> in Spanish, but in some English speaking regions of Spanish heritage it refers to any kind of earth construction, as most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to <a href="cob%20%28material%29">cob</a> and <a href="rammed%20earth">rammed earth</a> buildings. Adobe is among the earliest building materials, and is used throughout the world.

Adobe bricks are most often made into units weighing less than 100 pounds and small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking and be subsequently assembled, with the application of adobe mud, to bond the individual bricks into a structure. Modern methods of construction allow the pouring of whole adobe walls that are reinforced with steel.

In dry climates, adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world. Adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater <a href="thermal%20mass">thermal mass</a>, but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not somehow reinforced. Cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the <a href="1976%20Guatemala%20earthquake">1976 Guatemala earthquake</a>, the <a href="2003%20Bam%20earthquake">2003 Bam earthquake</a> and the <a href="2010%20Chile%20earthquake">2010 Chile earthquake</a>.

Buildings made of sun-dried earth are common throughout the world (<a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a>, <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, southwestern <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, and <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>.) Adobe had been in use by <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous peoples of the Americas</a> in the <a href="Southwestern%20United%20States">Southwestern United States</a>, <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>, and the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> for several thousand years. <a href="Puebloan%20peoples">Puebloan peoples</a> built their adobe structures with handfuls or basketfuls of adobe, until the Spanish introduced them to making bricks. Adobe bricks were used in Spain from the <a href="Bronze%20Age%23Age%20sub-divisions">Late Bronze</a> and <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>s (eighth century BCE onwards). Its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture, and economics.

A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller "adobes", which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger "adobines", some of which may be one to two yards (1‚Äì2¬†m) long.

The word "adobe" has existed for around 4000 years with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning. The word can be traced from the <a href="Middle%20Egyptian%20language">Middle Egyptian</a> (c. 2000¬†BC) word "…übt" "mudbrick." Middle Egyptian evolved into <a href="Late%20Egyptian%20language">Late Egyptian</a>, <a href="Demotic%20%28Egyptian%29">Demotic</a> or "pre-Coptic", and finally to Coptic (c. 600¬†BC), where it appeared as œÑœâœâŒ≤Œµ . This was borrowed into Arabic as "a·π≠-·π≠awbu" or "a·π≠-·π≠≈´bu", with the <a href="Article%20%28grammar%29%23Definite%20article">definite article</a> "al-" attached, "tuba", which was assimilated into the <a href="Old%20Spanish%20language">Old Spanish language</a> as "adobe" , probably via <a href="Mozarabic%20language">Mozarabic</a>. English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early 18th century.
In more modern <a href="English%20language">English</a> usage, the term "adobe" has come to include a style of architecture popular in the <a href="desert">desert</a> <a href="climate">climate</a>s of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, especially in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>.

An adobe brick is a <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a> made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as <a href="straw">straw</a> or <a href="Dung%20%28matter%29">dung</a>. The <a href="soil">soil</a> composition typically contains <a href="sand">sand</a>, <a href="silt">silt</a> and <a href="clay">clay</a>. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick. Dung offers the same advantage. The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15% clay, 10‚Äì30% silt and 55‚Äì75% fine sand. Another source quotes 15‚Äì25% clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles with no deleterious effect. Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland <a href="cement">cement</a> up to 10% by weight.

No more than half the clay content should be <a href="expansive%20clay">expansive clay</a>s with the remainder non-expansive illite or kaolinite. Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick resulting in cracking, while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick. Typically the soils of the Southwest United States, where such construction is in use, are an adequate composition.

Adobe walls are load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength. In the United States, most building codes call for a minimum compressive strength of 300¬†lbf/in (2.07¬†newton/mm) for the adobe block. Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads. The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load. Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses. To withstand such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50¬†lbf/in (0.345¬†newton/mm) for the finished block.

In addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction. In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the living space temperature. The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun (<a href="radiation">radiation</a>) and from the surrounding air (<a href="convection">convection</a>) before they warm through to the interior. After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will then continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time-lag effect. Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.

Thermodynamic material properties are sparsely quoted. The thermal resistance of adobe is quoted as having an <a href="R-value%20%28insulation%29">R-value</a> of R = 0.41 h ft ¬∞F/(<a href="Btu">Btu</a> in) and a conductivity of 0.57 W/(m K) quoted from another source. A third source provides the following properties: conductivity=0.30 Btu/(h ft ¬∞F); heat capacity=0.24 Btu/(lb ¬∞F); density=106 lb/ft (1700¬†kg/m). To determine the total R-value of a wall for example, multiply R by the thickness of the wall. From knowledge of the adobe density, heat capacity and a diffusivity value, the conductivity is found to be k = 0.20 Btu/(h ft ¬∞F) or 0.35 W/(m K). The heat capacity is commonly quoted as c = 0.20 Btu/(lb F) or 840 joules/(kg K). The density is 95 lb/ft or 1520¬†kg/m. The thermal diffusivity is calculated to be 0.0105¬†ft/h or 2.72x10 m/s.

Poured and <a href="Puddling%20%28engineering%29">puddled</a> adobe (puddled clay, piled earth) today called "cob", is made by placing soft adobe in layers, rather than making by individual dried bricks or using a form. Puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sand based material worked into a dense, plastic state. These are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the Americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and then later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.

Bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame. In North America, the brick is typically about in size. The mixture is molded into the frame, which is then is removed after initial setting. After drying for a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying. Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.

The same mixture, without straw, is used to make <a href="Mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a> and often <a href="plaster">plaster</a> on interior and exterior walls. Some ancient cultures used <a href="Lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.

Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks. Reinforcement can include manure, straw, <a href="cement">cement</a>, <a href="rebar">rebar</a> or wooden posts. Experience has shown straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick. A test is done on the soil content first. To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid. The container is shaken vigorously for one minute. It is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers. Heavier particles settle out first, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The <a href="Cooperative%20State%20Research%2C%20Education%2C%20and%20Extension%20Service">Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service</a> at <a href="New%20Mexico%20State%20University">New Mexico State University</a> recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.

The ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed, as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to below the ground frost level. The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively. Modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a <a href="lintel">lintel</a> is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.

The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand and organic materials. The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe.

Depending on the materials available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly. This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking.

The more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads. The heaviest wooden beams, called <a href="Viga%20%28architecture%29">vigas</a>, lie atop the wall. Across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas and upon those brush is then laid. Finally, the adobe layer is applied.

To construct a flat adobe roof, beams of wood were laid to span the building, the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls. Once the vigas, latillas and brush are laid, adobe bricks are placed. An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof. Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick‚Äôs edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain. 

Depending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof. The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials. The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls

The largest structure ever made from adobe is the <a href="Arg-%C3%A9%20Bam">Arg-√© Bam</a> built by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>. Other large adobe structures are the <a href="Huaca%20del%20Sol">Huaca del Sol</a> in <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, with 100 million signed bricks and the "ciudellas" of <a href="Chan%20Chan">Chan Chan</a> and <a href="Tambo%20Colorado">Tambo Colorado</a>, both in Peru.

Adventure

An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually <a href="risk">risk</a>y undertaking, with an uncertain outcome. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as <a href="traveling">traveling</a>, <a href="exploring">exploring</a>, <a href="skydiving">skydiving</a>, <a href="mountain%20climbing">mountain climbing</a>, <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a>, <a href="river%20rafting">river rafting</a> or participating in <a href="extreme%20sports">extreme sports</a>. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.

The word adventuress can mean a female who enjoys or partakes in adventures, but (particularly in older literature) it can also have the negative connotation of one who schemes for material advancement by the use her sexuality; a <a href="gold%20digging">gold digger</a> As an instance of the latter the "Oxford English Dictionary" cites "Our Adventuress had the pickings of a few Feathers from an old Gentleman who fell in Love with her".

Adventurous experiences create psychological <a href="arousal">arousal</a>, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. <a href="fear">fear</a>) or positive (e.g. <a href="flow%20%28psychology%29">flow</a>). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Malraux">Andr√© Malraux</a>, in his "La Condition Humaine" (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?". Similarly, <a href="Helen%20Keller">Helen Keller</a> stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of <a href="recreation">recreation</a> or <a href="wikt%3Aexcitement">excitement</a>: examples are <a href="adventure%20racing">adventure racing</a> and <a href="Adventure%20travel">adventure tourism</a>. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers ‚Äì the British adventurer <a href="Jason%20Lewis%20%28adventurer%29">Jason Lewis</a>, for example, uses adventures to draw global <a href="sustainability">sustainability</a> lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. <a href="Adventure%20education">Adventure education</a> intentionally uses challenging experiences for <a href="learning">learning</a>.

Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="The%20Odyssey">The Odyssey</a>". 

The <a href="knight%20errant">knight errant</a> was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.

The <a href="adventure%20novel">adventure novel</a> exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature <a href="Adventure%20film">films</a>, such as "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" and "<a href="Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>".

Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the <a href="wilderness">wilderness</a> or <a href="Mother%20Nature">Mother Nature</a>. Examples include books such as <a href="Hatchet%20%28book%29">Hatchet</a> or <a href="My%20Side%20of%20the%20Mountain">My Side of the Mountain</a>. These books are less about "questing", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.
Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles. Mythologist <a href="Joseph%20Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a> discussed his notion of the <a href="monomyth">monomyth</a> in his book, "<a href="The%20Hero%20with%20a%20Thousand%20Faces">The Hero with a Thousand Faces</a>". Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.
Many <a href="video%20games">video games</a> are adventure games.

From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a>'s journal "<a href="The%20Travels%20of%20Marco%20Polo">The Travels of Marco Polo</a>" or <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>'s "<a href="Roughing%20It">Roughing It</a>". Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of <a href="Meriwether%20Lewis">Lewis</a> and <a href="William%20Clark">Clark</a> or <a href="Captain%20James%20Cook">Captain James Cook</a>'s journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as <a href="The%20Right%20Stuff%20%28book%29">The Right Stuff</a> by <a href="Tom%20Wolfe">Tom Wolfe</a>, or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as Conquistadors of the Useless by <a href="Lionel%20Terray">Lionel Terray</a>. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.

There are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include <a href="mountain%20climbing">mountain climbing</a>, <a href="skydiving">skydiving</a>, or other <a href="extreme%20sports">extreme sports</a>.

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the <a href="human%20population">human population</a>, was the site of many of the <a href="cradle%20of%20civilization">first civilizations</a>. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of /1e9 round 1 billion people, or roughly 60% of the world's population.

In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, on the south by the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> and on the north by the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>. The western boundary with Europe is a historical and <a href="cultural%20construct">cultural construct</a>, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>, the <a href="Ural%20River">Ural River</a>, and the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a>, and south of the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a> and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian</a> and <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>s.

<a href="China">China</a> and <a href="India">India</a> alternated in being the <a href="List%20of%20regions%20by%20past%20GDP%20%28PPP%29">largest economies in the world</a> from 1 to 1800 CE. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of America by Columbus in search for India demonstrates this deep fascination. The <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> became the main East-West trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the <a href="Straits%20of%20Malacca">Straits of Malacca</a> stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream <a href="religion">religion</a>s including <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a> (or Daoism), <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, <a href="Zoroastranism">Zoroastranism</a>, as well as many other religions.

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia‚Äîa <a href="toponymy">name</a> dating back to <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>‚Äîmay actually have more to do with <a href="human%20geography">human geography</a> than <a href="physical%20geography">physical geography</a>. Asia varies greatly across and within <a href="Regions%20of%20Asia">its regions</a> with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>.

The boundary between Asia and Africa is the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Suez Canal. This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.

The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics. The <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don River</a> became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter the Great</a>, king of the <a href="Tsardom%20of%20Russia">Tsardom of Russia</a>, defeating rival claims of <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, synthesized a new <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> extending to the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> and beyond, founded in 1721. The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poltava">Battle of Poltava</a> in 1709 and assigned to <a href="Tobolsk">Tobolsk</a>, where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, <a href="Vasily%20Tatishchev">Vasily Tatishchev</a>, and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 <a href="Philip%20Johan%20von%20Strahlenberg">Philip Johan von Strahlenberg</a> published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia. The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the <a href="Emba%20River">Emba River</a> as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the <a href="Ural%20River">Ural River</a> prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects. The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a>, although it is sometimes placed further north.

The border between Asia and the region of <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a> is usually placed somewhere in the <a href="Malay%20Archipelago">Malay Archipelago</a>. The <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Maluku Islands</a> in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."

Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the <a href="Ancient%20Greeks">Ancient Greeks</a>, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe. It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.

From the time of <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them. For example, Sir <a href="Barry%20Cunliffe">Barry Cunliffe</a>, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of Asia". 

Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> with Europe being a northwestern <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a> of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass - <a href="Afro-Eurasia">Afro-Eurasia</a> (except for the Suez Canal) and share a common <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>. Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the <a href="Eurasian%20Plate">Eurasian Plate</a>, adjoined on the south by the <a href="Arabian%20Plate">Arabian</a> and <a href="Indian%20Plate">Indian Plate</a> and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the <a href="Chersky%20Range">Chersky Range</a>) on the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a>.

The English name "Asia" was originally a concept of <a href="Greek%20civilization">Greek civilization</a>. The place name "Asia" in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience. Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain. It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names. A number of theories have been published. English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature, where it has the same form, Asia. Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> is much less certain. One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a>. This <a href="metonymy">metonymical</a> change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as <a href="Skandinavia">Skandinavia</a> (from <a href="Scania">Scania</a>).

Before Greek poetry, the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> area was in a <a href="Greek%20Dark%20Age">Greek Dark Age</a>, at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> the records of the <a href="Assyrian%20Empire">Assyrian Empire</a>, the <a href="Hittite%20Empire">Hittite Empire</a> and the various <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200¬†BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the <a href="Dorian%20invasion">Dorian invasion</a> to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a>, deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, <a href="Michael%20Ventris">Michael Ventris</a>, subsequently assisted by the scholar, <a href="John%20Chadwick">John Chadwick</a>. A major cache discovered by <a href="Carl%20Blegen">Carl Blegen</a> at the site of ancient <a href="Pylos">Pylos</a> included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet, lawiaiai, "captives," associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies "women of Asia." Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a>, a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased. The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it. There is a masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia." This name, "Assuwa", has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent "Asia". The <a href="Assuwa%20league">Assuwa league</a> was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> under <a href="Tudhaliya%20I">Tudhaliya I</a> around 1400¬†BCE.

Alternatively, the <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the term may be from the <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a> word "(w)a·π£√ª(m)", which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word "asa" meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for "Europe", as being from Akkadian "erƒìbu(m)" 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

<a href="T.R.%20Reid">T.R. Reid</a> supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from "asu", meaning 'east' in <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n ("ereb" for "Europe" meaning 'west'). The ideas of "Occidental" (form <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "Occidens" 'setting') and "Oriental" (from Latin "Oriens" for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with "Western" and "Eastern". Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and <a href="Eastern%20world">Eastern civilizations</a> on the <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>n continent. Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.

Latin Asia and Greek ·ºàœÉŒØŒ± appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated ·ºàœÉŒØŒ± as Asia. The Romans named a province <a href="Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Asia</a>, which roughly corresponds with modern-day central-western Turkey. There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from ·ºàœÉŒØŒ±, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, who were all Greek. <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440¬†BCE), not because he innovated it, but because his "Histories" are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail. He defines it carefully, mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing. By it he means <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a>, in contrast to <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" (<a href="Europa%20%28mythology%29">Europa</a>, <a href="Asia%20%28mythology%29">Asia</a>, and <a href="Libya%20%28mythology%29">Libya</a>, referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a> (i.e. <a href="Hesione">Hesione</a>), but that the <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>ns say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a>. In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, "<a href="Asia%20%28mythology%29">Asia</a>" ("·ºàœÉŒØŒ±") or "Asie" ("·ºàœÉŒØŒ∑") was the name of a "<a href="Nymph">Nymph</a> or <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> goddess of Lydia."

In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became "Greek mythology." For example, <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> mentions the daughters of <a href="Tethys%20%28mythology%29">Tethys</a> and <a href="Oceanus">Ocean</a>, among whom are a "holy company", "who with the Lord <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and the Rivers have youths in their keeping." Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia. Hesiod explains:"For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters." The <a href="Iliad">Iliad</a> (attributed by the ancient Greeks to <a href="Homer">Homer</a>) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the <a href="Luvians">Luvians</a> in Lydia) in the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a> named <a href="Asius%20%28mythology%29">Asios</a> (an adjective meaning "Asian"); and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as Œ±œÉŒπŒøœÇ.

The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>, <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>, <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian <a href="steppe">steppe</a>s.

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, the <a href="Indus%20Valley">Indus Valley</a> and the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a> shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the <a href="steppe">steppe</a>s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the <a href="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Indo-Europeans</a>, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of <a href="China">China</a>, where the <a href="Tocharians">Tocharians</a> resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and <a href="tundra">tundra</a>. These areas remained very sparsely populated.
The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and <a href="Himalaya">Himalaya</a> mountains and the <a href="Karakum%20Desert">Karakum</a> and <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi</a> deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the <a href="nomad">nomad</a>s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a> took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the <a href="Muslim%20conquests">Muslim conquests</a> of the 7th century. The <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol Empire</a> conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.

The <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>, one of the most devastating <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>.

The <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> by the end of the 19th century. The <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the <a href="Manchu%20people">Manchu</a> conquered China and established the <a href="Qing%20Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>. The Islamic <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a> and the Hindu <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha Empire</a> controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.

Asia is the largest <a href="continent">continent</a> on Earth. It covers 8.8% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at . Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. It is located to the east of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> and the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a>, and south of the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a> (or the <a href="Kuma%E2%80%93Manych%20Depression">Kuma‚ÄìManych Depression</a>) and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian</a> and <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>s. It is bounded on the east by the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, on the south by the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> and on the north by the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>. Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, three of them (<a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>) having part of their land in Europe.

Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a> is in <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and the <a href="Arabian%20Desert">Arabian Desert</a> stretches across much of the Middle East. The <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a> in China is the longest river in the continent. The <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm <a href="Maplecroft">Maplecroft</a> identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a <a href="semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid climate</a>, the temperature increased by 0.4¬†¬∞C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the <a href="International%20Crops%20Research%20Institute%20for%20the%20Semi-Arid%20Tropics">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics</a> (<a href="ICRISAT">ICRISAT</a>) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a>.

Asia has the second largest <a href="Real%20versus%20nominal%20value%20%28economics%29">nominal</a> GDP of all continents, after Europe, but the largest when measured in <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a>. As of 2011, the largest economies in Asia are <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> and <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in Asia: <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a> and <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. Around 68 percent of international firms have office in Hong Kong.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of <a href="China">China</a> and India have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. Other recent very-high-growth nations in Asia include <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and mineral-rich nations such as <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a>, the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>, <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>, <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a> and <a href="Oman">Oman</a>.

According to <a href="economic%20historian">economic historian</a> <a href="Angus%20Maddison">Angus Maddison</a> in his book "The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective", India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE. China was the <a href="Economic%20history%20of%20China">largest and most advanced economy</a> on earth for much of recorded history, until the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> (excluding <a href="British%20India">India</a>) overtook it in the mid-19th century. For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> (measured in net material product) in 1986 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU), the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (NAFTA) or <a href="APEC">APEC</a>). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large (current exchange rate method) as that of the rest of Asia combined. In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 <a href="Japanese%20yen">yen</a>/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the <a href="Pacific%20Rim">Pacific Rim</a>, known as the <a href="Four%20Asian%20Tigers">Asian tigers</a>, which have now all received developed country status, having the highest <a href="GDP%20per%20capita">GDP per capita</a> in Asia.
It is forecasted that <a href="India">India</a> will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2020. By 2027, according to <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a>, China will have the largest economy in the world. Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the <a href="Association%20of%20Southeast%20Asian%20Nations">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a>.

Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, India, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of <a href="multinational%20corporation">multinational corporation</a>s, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.

According to <a href="Citigroup">Citigroup</a> 9 of 11 <a href="3G%20%28countries%29">Global Growth Generators</a> countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, China, India, Indonesia, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, Mongolia, Philippines, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and Vietnam. Asia has four main financial centers: Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. <a href="Call%20center">Call center</a>s and <a href="business%20process%20outsourcing">business process outsourcing</a> (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, <a href="English%20language">English-speaking</a> workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.

In 2010, Asia had 3.3¬†million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4¬†million millionaires. Last year Asia had toppled Europe.
Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's "economic center of gravity" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.

With growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, <a href="MasterCard">MasterCard</a> has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 international visitors.

<a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a> had by far the strongest overall <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a> (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.
<br><a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.
<br> Japan and South Korea ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the "very high human development" category), followed by Hong Kong (21) and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> (27). <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.

Asia is home to several <a href="language%20family">language families</a> and many <a href="language%20isolate">language isolate</a>s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to <a href="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>, more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

Many of the world's <a href="major%20religious%20groups">major religions</a> have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding <a href="irreligion">irreligion</a>), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the <a href="Flood%20myth">Great Flood</a> for example, as presented to Christians in the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> in the narrative of <a href="Noah">Noah</a>, is first found in <a href="Mesopotamian%20mythology">Mesopotamian mythology</a>, in the "<a href="Epic%20of%20Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</a>". Likewise, the same story of <a href="Flood%20myth">Great Flood</a> is presented to Muslims in the Holy <a href="Quran">Quran</a>, again in the narrative of <a href="Noah">Noah</a>, Who according to <a href="Islamic%20mythology">Islamic mythology</a> was a <a href="Prophet">Prophet</a> and Built an Ark on <a href="Allah">Allah</a>'s Command to save the True Believers from the Great Flood (Great Calamity). <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a> also tells about an <a href="Avatar">Avatar</a> of the <a href="Vishnu">God Vishnu</a> in the form of a <a href="Matsya">fish</a> who warned <a href="Sraddhadeva%20Manu">Manu</a> of a terrible flood. In ancient <a href="Chinese%20mythology">Chinese mythology</a>, <a href="Shan%20Hai%20Jing">Shan Hai Jing</a>, the Chinese ruler <a href="King%20Yu%20of%20Xia%20of%20China">Da Yu</a>, had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess <a href="N%C3%BCwa">N√ºwa</a> who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring.

The <a href="Abrahamic%20religions">Abrahamic religions</a> of <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bah√°'√≠ Faith</a> originated in West Asia.

<a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, the birthplace and historical homeland of the <a href="Jews">Hebrew nation</a> which today consists equally of those <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> who remained in <a href="Mizrahi%20Jews">Asia/North Africa</a> and those who returned from <a href="Jewish%20diaspora">diaspora</a> in <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Europe</a>, <a href="American%20Jews">North America</a>, and other regions, though sizable communities continue to live abroad. <a href="Jews">Jews</a> are the predominant ethnic group in <a href="Israel">Israel</a> (75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million, although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion are unspecified. Outside of Israel there are small ancient communities of <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> still live in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> (17,400), <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> (9,100), <a href="Iran">Iran</a> (8,756), <a href="India">India</a> (5,000) and <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> (4,000).

In <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and Asian Russia, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodoxy</a> is the predominant religion. Various Christian <a href="Christian%20denomination">denominations</a> have adherents in portions of the Middle East, as well as China and India. <a href="Saint%20Thomas%20Christians">Saint Thomas Christians</a> in <a href="India">India</a> trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of <a href="Thomas%20the%20Apostle">Thomas the Apostle</a> in the 1st century.

<a href="Islam">Islam</a>, which originated in <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, is the largest and most widely spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia. With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, followed by <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>, <a href="Medina">Medina</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> are the holiest cities for Islam in all the world.

The <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bah√°'√≠ Faith</a> originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bah√°'u'll√°h. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Bah√°'√≠ activities in many Muslim countries has been severely <a href="Persecution%20of%20Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%ADs">suppressed</a> by authorities. <a href="Lotus%20Temple">Lotus Temple</a> is a big Baha'i Temple in India.

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. <a href="Indian%20philosophy">Indian philosophy</a> includes <a href="Hindu%20philosophy">Hindu philosophy</a> and <a href="Buddhist%20philosophy">Buddhist philosophy</a>. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, <a href="C%C4%81rv%C4%81ka">CƒÅrvƒÅka</a>, preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> and <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a> and <a href="Zen">Zen Buddhism</a> took shape.

As of 2012, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the second largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> (96%), <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> (95%), <a href="Burma">Burma</a> (80%‚Äì89%), <a href="Japan">Japan</a> (36%‚Äì96%), <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> (75%‚Äì84%), <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> (70%), <a href="Laos">Laos</a> (60%‚Äì67%) and <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> (53%‚Äì93%). Large Buddhist populations also exist in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> (33%‚Äì51%), <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> (35%‚Äì93%), <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> (23%‚Äì50%), <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> (19%‚Äì21%), <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> (9%‚Äì11%), <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> (10%‚Äì75%), <a href="China">China</a> (20%‚Äì50%), <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> (1.5%‚Äì14%), and small communities in <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. In many Chinese communities, Mahayana Buddhism is easily syncretized with Taoism, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated. The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.

<a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> is found mainly in India and in oversea Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia.
<a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia.
<a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations.
<a href="Taoism">Taoism</a> is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Taoism is easily syncretized with <a href="Mahayana%20Buddhism">Mahayana Buddhism</a> for many Chinese, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.

Aruba

Aruba ( ; ) is a <a href="Countries%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">constituent country</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a> in the southern <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, located about west of the main part of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> and north of the coast of <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. It measures long from its northwestern to its southeastern end and across at its widest point. Together with <a href="Bonaire">Bonaire</a> and <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Cura√ßao</a>, Aruba forms a group referred to as the <a href="ABC%20islands%20%28Lesser%20Antilles%29">ABC islands</a>. Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the <a href="Dutch%20Caribbean">Dutch Caribbean</a>.

Aruba is one of the four countries that form the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>, along with the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Cura√ßao</a>, and <a href="Sint%20Maarten">Sint Maarten</a>; the citizens of these countries are all Dutch nationals. Aruba has no administrative subdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions. Its capital is <a href="Oranjestad%2C%20Aruba">Oranjestad</a>.

Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, <a href="cactus">cactus</a>-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of and is densely populated, with a total of 102,484 inhabitants at the 2010 Census. It lies outside <a href="Hurricane%20Alley">Hurricane Alley</a>.

Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to have been <a href="Caquetios%20Indian">Caquet√≠o Amerindians</a> from the <a href="Arawak%20peoples">Arawak</a> tribe, who migrated there from <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> to escape attacks by the <a href="Kalina%20people">Caribs</a>. Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. As sea currents made <a href="canoe">canoe</a> travel to other <a href="Caribbean%20islands">Caribbean islands</a> difficult, <a href="Caquetio">Caquetio</a> culture remained more closely associated with that of mainland South America.

Europeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations for Spain by <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> and <a href="Alonso%20de%20Ojeda">Alonso de Ojeda</a> in the summer of 1499. Both described Aruba as an "island of giants", remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquet√≠os compared to Europeans. Gold was not discovered on Aruba for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and <a href="Caesalpinia%20echinata">brazilwood</a> from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and Spaniards soon colonized the island.

Because it had low rainfall, Aruba was not considered profitable for the plantation system and the economics of the <a href="slave%20trade">slave trade</a>.

Aruba was colonized by <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spain</a> for over a century. "Simas", the "<a href="Cacique">Cacique</a>", or <a href="Tribal%20chief">chief</a>, in Aruba, welcomed the first Catholic priests in Aruba, who gave him a wooden cross as a gift. In 1508, the Spanish Crown appointed Alonso de Ojeda as its first Governor of Aruba, as part of "Nueva Andaluc√≠a". Arawaks spoke the "broken Spanish" which their ancestors had learned on <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>.

Another governor appointed by Spain was <a href="Juan%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20de%20Ampi%C3%A9s">Juan Mart√≠nez de Ampi√©s</a>. A "c√©dula real" decreed in November 1525 gave Ampi√©s, factor of Espa√±ola, the right to repopulate Aruba. In 1528, Ampi√©s was replaced by a representative of the <a href="Welser">House of Welser</a> of <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>.

The <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> statutes have applied to Aruba since 1629. The Netherlands acquired Aruba in 1636. Since 1636, Aruba has been under <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch</a> administration, initially governed by <a href="Peter%20Stuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</a>, later appointed to <a href="New%20Amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> (New York City). Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. The island was included under the <a href="Dutch%20West%20India%20Company">Dutch West India Company</a> (W.I.C.) administration, as "New Netherland and Cura√ßao", from 1648 to 1664. In 1667 the Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as "Commandeur" in Aruba.

The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, leaving the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean.

During the Napoleonic wars, the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> took control over the island, between 1799 and 1802, and between 1804 and 1816, before handing it back to the Dutch.

During World War II with the <a href="Netherlands%20in%20World%20War%20II%23German%20occupation">occupation of the Netherlands</a> in 1940 the oil facilities in Aruba came under the administration of the <a href="Dutch%20government-in-exile">Dutch government-in-exile</a> in London, and <a href="Attack%20on%20Aruba">Aruba continued to supply oil to the British and their allies</a>.

In August 1947, Aruba presented its first "Staatsreglement" (constitution), for Aruba's "<a href="Independence">status aparte</a>" as an autonomous state within the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>. By 1954, the <a href="Charter%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands</a> was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.

In 1972, at a conference in <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>, <a href="Betico%20Croes">Betico Croes</a> (MEP), a politician from Aruba, proposed a "sui-generis" Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the <a href="Netherlands%20Antilles">Netherlands Antilles</a>, each to have its own nationality. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a <a href="referendum">referendum</a> so that the people of Aruba could choose whether they wanted total independence or "Status Aparte" as a full autonomous state under the Crown.

Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, he appointed a committee that chose the national flag and anthem, introducing them as symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence. He set 1981 as a target date for independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the United Nations; 82% of the participants voted for independence.

The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> to prepare a study for independence; it was titled "Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg" (Aruba and independence, backgrounds, modalities and opportunities; a preliminary report) (1978). At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.

In March 1983, Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for its independence, to be developed in a series of steps as the Crown granted increasing autonomy. In August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles; it officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was projected in 1996.

After his death in 1986, Croes was proclaimed "Libertador di Aruba". At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's <a href="Nelson%20Oduber">Prime Minister</a>, the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely its transition to full independence. The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process could be revived after another referendum.

Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the <a href="Leeward%20Antilles">Leeward Antilles</a> island arc of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> in the southern part of the Caribbean. It has white sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents. This is where most tourist development has occurred. The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.

The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called <a href="Hooiberg">Hooiberg</a> at and <a href="Mount%20Jamanota">Mount Jamanota</a>, the highest on the island at above sea level. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at .

To the east of Aruba are <a href="Bonaire">Bonaire</a> and <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Cura√ßao</a>, two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the <a href="Netherlands%20Antilles">Netherlands Antilles</a>. This group of islands is sometimes called the <a href="ABC%20islands%20%28Lesser%20Antilles%29">ABC islands</a>. They are located on the South American <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a> and therefore geographically listed as part of South America.

The <a href="Aruba%20Natural%20Bridge">Natural Bridge</a> was a large, naturally formed limestone bridge on the island's north shore. It was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005.

The island, with a population of just over 100,000 inhabitants, does not have major cities. However, most of the island's population resides in or surrounding the two major city-like districts of Oranjestad (Capital) and San Nicolaas. Furthermore, the island is divided into six districts, which are:

The island of Aruba, being isolated from the main land of South America, has fostered the evolution of multiple endemic animals. The island provides a habitat for the endemic <a href="Cnemidophorus%20arubensis">Aruban Whiptail</a> and <a href="Crotalus%20durissus%20unicolor">Aruba Rattlesnake</a>, as well as endemic subspecies of <a href="Athene%20cunicularia">Burrowing Owl</a> and <a href="Eupsittula%20pertinax">Brown-throated Parakeet</a>.

The rattlesnake and the owl are printed on the Aruban <a href="Aruban%20Florin">currency</a>.

The flora of Aruba differs from the typical tropical island vegetation. <a href="Xeric%20scrublands">Xeric scrublands</a> are common, with various forms of <a href="cacti">cacti</a>, thorny shrubs and evergreens. The most known plant is the <a href="Aloe%20vera">Aloe vera</a>, which has a place on the <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Aruba">Coat of Arms of Aruba</a>.

In the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">K√∂ppen climate classification</a>, Aruba has a <a href="tropics">tropical</a> <a href="semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid climate</a>. Mean monthly temperature in Oranjestad varies little from to , moderated by constant <a href="trade%20winds">trade winds</a> from the Atlantic Ocean, which comes from north-east. Yearly precipitation barely exceeds in Oranjestad.

The population is estimated to be 75% mixed <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Europe">European</a>/<a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a>/<a href="Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Africa">African</a>, 15% <a href="Afro-Aruban">Black</a> and 10% other ethnicities.

The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded <a href="Native%20American%20%28Americas%29">Aboriginals</a> remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic <a href="Arawak%20peoples">Arawak</a> heritage. Most of the population is descended from Caquetio Indians and Dutch and to a lesser extent of Africans, Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Sephardic Jewish ancestors.

Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting <a href="foreign%20worker">foreign worker</a>s to a maximum of three years residency on the island.

Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela. Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants. There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.

The official languages are <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> and <a href="Papiamento">Papiamento</a>. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. It is a <a href="creole%20language">creole language</a>, spoken on Aruba, <a href="Bonaire">Bonaire</a>, and <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Cura√ßao</a>, that incorporates words from Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. English is known by many; its usage has grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken, based on the size of their community, are Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French.

In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. "y" instead of "j"), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.

The book "The Buccaneers of America", first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the natives on Aruba spoke Spanish already. The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.

Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: "Diario", "Bon Dia", "Solo di Pueblo" and "Awe Mainta"; and three in English: "Aruba Daily", "Aruba Today" and "The News". "Amigoe" is a newspaper published in Dutch. Aruba also has 18 radio stations (two AM and 16 FM) and two local television stations (<a href="Telearuba">Telearuba</a>, and Channel 22).

Three-quarters of the population is Roman Catholic.

For census purposes, Aruba is divided into eight regions, which have no administrative functions:

As a <a href="Countries%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">constituent country</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>, Aruba's politics take place within a framework of a 21-member <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">Parliament</a> and an eight-member Cabinet. The <a href="governor%20of%20Aruba">governor of Aruba</a> is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or "Parlamento") for four-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.

Together with the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the countries of Aruba, <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Cura√ßao</a> and <a href="Sint%20Maarten">Sint Maarten</a> form the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>. As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport. As Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration. To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands.

Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.

The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model. In Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with the "Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg" (<a href="Court%20of%20First%20Instance">Court of First Instance</a>) on Aruba, the "Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie van Aruba, Cura√ßao, Sint Maarten en van Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba" (<a href="Joint%20Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20Aruba%2C%20Cura%C3%A7ao%2C%20Sint%20Maarten%2C%20and%20of%20Bonaire%2C%20Sint%20Eustatius%20and%20Saba">Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Cura√ßao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba</a>) and the "<a href="Hoge%20Raad%20der%20Nederlanden">Hoge Raad der Nederlanden</a>" (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands). The "Korps Politie Aruba" (<a href="Aruba%20Police%20Force">Aruba Police Force</a>) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.

<a href="Deficit%20spending">Deficit spending</a> has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. By 2006, the government's debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins. Aruba received some <a href="development%20aid">development aid</a> from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as "Aruba's Financial Independence") in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year.

In 2006, the Aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit. <a href="Direct%20tax">Direct tax</a>es have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">IMF</a>. A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%. The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007.

Aruba's educational system is patterned after the <a href="Education%20in%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch system of education</a>.

The Government of Aruba finances the public national education system.

There are private schools, including the <a href="International%20School%20of%20Aruba">International School of Aruba</a> and Schakel College.

There are two <a href="medical%20schools">medical schools</a>, <a href="Aureus%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine">Aureus University School of Medicine</a> and <a href="Xavier%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine">Xavier University School of Medicine</a>, as well as its own national university, the University of Aruba.

Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region. There is a low unemployment rate.

The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $28,924 in 2014; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas. Its main trading partners are Colombia, the United States, Venezuela, and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

The island's economy has been dominated by three main industries: tourism, <a href="aloe">aloe</a> export, and <a href="Oil%20refinery">petroleum refining</a> (The <a href="Lago%20Oil%20and%20Transport%20Company">Lago Oil and Transport Company</a> and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.). Before the "Status Aparte" (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector. Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.

The official exchange rate of the <a href="Aruban%20florin">Aruban florin</a> is pegged to the US dollar at 1.79 florins to 1 USD. Because of this fact, and due to a large number of American tourists, many businesses operate using US dollars instead of florins, especially in the hotel and resort districts.

About three quarters of the Aruban <a href="gross%20national%20product">gross national product</a> is earned through tourism or related activities. Most tourists are from the United States (predominantly from the north-east US), the Netherlands and South America, mainly Venezuela and Colombia.

As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, citizens of the Netherlands can travel with relative ease to Aruba and other islands of the Dutch Antilles. No visas are needed for Dutch citizens, only a passport, and although the currency used in Aruba is different (the Netherlands uses the <a href="Euro">Euro</a>), money can be easily exchanged at a local bank for <a href="Aruban%20Florin">Aruban Florin</a>s.

For the facilitation of the passengers whose destination is the United States, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">United States Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS), <a href="U.S.%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since 1 February 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport. United States and Aruba have had the agreement since 1986. It began as a USDA and Customs post. Since 2008, Aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights.

In 1999, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a> established a <a href="Forward%20Operating%20Site">Forward Operating Location</a> (FOL) at the airport.

On 18 March, Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.

Aruba has a varied culture. According to the "Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister" (BBSB), in 2005 there were ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of "<a href="Sinterklaas">Sinterklaas</a>" on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 27 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the King's birthday or "Dia di Rey" (<a href="Koningsdag">Koningsdag</a>) is celebrated.
Christmas and <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> are celebrated with the typical music and songs for <a href="Gaita%20flutes">gaita</a>s for Christmas and the Dande for New Year, and "<a href="Hallaca">ayaca</a>", "<a href="ponche%20crema">ponche crema</a>", ham, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of florins worth of <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a> are burnt at midnight on New Year's Eve. On 25 January, <a href="Betico%20Croes">Betico Croes</a>' birthday is celebrated. <a href="St%20John%27s%20Eve">Dia di San Juan</a> is celebrated on 24 June.

Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Ascension">Feast of the Ascension</a> and <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> are holidays on the island.

The holiday of <a href="Carnival">Carnaval</a> is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like <a href="Mardi%20Gras">Mardi Gras</a>, that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from Venezuela and the nearby islands (Cura√ßao, St. Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).

Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> and Thanksgiving Day in November.

Aruba's <a href="Queen%20Beatrix%20International%20Airport">Queen Beatrix International Airport</a> is located near Oranjestad. According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, 61% of whom were Americans.

Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad and Barcadera. The Port of Playa services all the cruise-ship lines, including <a href="Royal%20Caribbean%20International">Royal Caribbean</a>, <a href="Carnival%20Cruise%20Lines">Carnival Cruise Lines</a>, <a href="Norwegian%20Cruise%20Line">NCL</a>, <a href="Holland%20America%20Line">Holland America Line</a>, <a href="Disney%20Cruise%20Line">Disney Cruise Line</a> and others. Nearly one million tourists enter this port per year. Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government, runs these seaports.

Arubus is a government-owned bus company. Its buses operate from 3:30¬†a.m. until 12:30¬†a.m., 365 days a year. Small private vans also provide transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.

A street car service runs on rails on the Mainstreet.

Water-en Energiebedrijf Aruba, N.V. (W.E.B.) produces potable industrial water at the world's third largest desalination plant. Average daily consumption in Aruba is about .

There are three telecommunications providers: <a href="SetarNV">Setar</a>, a government-based company, <a href="Mio%20Wireless">Mio Wireless</a> and <a href="Digicel">Digicel</a>, both of which are privately owned. Setar is the provider of services such as internet, video conferencing, <a href="GSM">GSM</a> wireless technology and land lines. <a href="Digicel">Digicel</a> is Setar's competitor in wireless technology using the GSM platform, and <a href="Mio%20Wireless">Mio Wireless</a> provides wireless technology and services using CDMA.

Articles of Confederation

The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was an agreement among the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">13 original states</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a> that served as its first constitution. Its drafting by a committee appointed by the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> began on July 12, 1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for <a href="ratification">ratification</a> on November 15, 1777. The Articles of Confederation <a href="Coming%20into%20force">came into force</a> on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the <a href="independence">independence</a> and <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20state">states</a>. The federal government received only those powers which the colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.

The Articles formed a war-time confederation of states, with an extremely limited central government. While unratified, the document was used by the Congress to conduct business, direct the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, conduct diplomacy with foreign nations, and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations. The adoption of the Articles made few perceptible changes in the federal government, because it did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but Americans continued to call it the "Continental Congress", since its organization remained the same.

As the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after <a href="Shays%27%20Rebellion">Shays' Rebellion</a>, individuals began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger national government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Convention</a>. It was quickly realized that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced. On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal government</a> under the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>. The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a>), courts, and taxing powers.

The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the <a href="Albany%20Congress">Albany Congress</a> in 1754 and <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>'s proposed <a href="Albany%20Plan">Albany Plan</a>, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown. With <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">civil disobedience</a> resulting in coercive, and what the colonials perceived as <a href="Intolerable%20Acts">intolerable acts</a> of Parliament, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">armed conflict</a> resulting in dissidents being <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Rebellion">proclaimed rebels</a> and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> began acting as the <a href="provisional%20government">provisional government</a> that would run the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> and gain the colonies their collective independence.

It was an era of constitution writing‚Äîmost states were busy at the task‚Äîand leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued <a href="fiat%20money">fiat money</a>, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.

To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a> argued in the closing pages of the first edition of "<a href="Common%20Sense%20%28pamphlet%29">Common Sense</a>" that the ‚Äúcustom of nations‚Äù demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a ‚Äúmanifesto‚Äù which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, ‚Äú[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.‚Äù

Beyond improving their existing <a href="Continental%20Association">association</a>, the records of the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Lee">Richard Henry Lee</a> introduced <a href="Lee%20Resolution">a resolution</a> before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve ‚Äúto take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances‚Äù and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration</a>, a <a href="Model%20Treaty">Model Treaty</a>, and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established ‚Äúa firm league‚Äù among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.

On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states. The committee met repeatedly, and chairman <a href="John%20Dickinson%20%28Pennsylvania%20and%20Delaware%29">John Dickinson</a> presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776. There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures. The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.
In practice, the Articles were in use beginning in 1777; the final draft of the Articles served as the <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> system of government used by the Congress ("the United States in Congress assembled") until it became <a href="de%20jure">de jure</a> by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederation">Congress of the Confederation</a>. Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government. The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government. It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories. Article XIII stipulated that "their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state" and "<a href="perpetual%20Union">the Union shall be perpetual</a>".

John Dickinson's and Benjamin Franklin's handwritten drafts of the Articles of Confederation are housed at the National Archives in Washington, DC.

The Articles were created by delegates from the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a need to have "a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States." After the war, nationalists, especially those who had been active in the Continental Army, complained that the Articles were too weak for an effective government. There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base. The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.

In 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> and the new government began operations in 1789.

Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777:

The document could not become officially effective until it was <a href="Ratification">ratified</a> by all 13 states. The first state to ratify was <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> on December 16, 1777; the thirteenth state to ratify was <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> on February 2, 1781. A ceremonial confirmation of this thirteenth, final ratification took place in the Congress on March 1, 1781, at high noon. Twelve states had ratified the Articles by February 1779, 14 months into the process. Maryland, however, refused to go along until the landed states, especially <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, had indicated they were prepared to <a href="State%20cession">cede their claims</a> west of the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> to the Union. It would be two years before the Maryland legislature became satisfied that they would follow through, and voted to ratify. The various states ratified the Articles of Confederation on the following dates:

The Articles of Confederation contain a <a href="preamble">preamble</a>, thirteen articles, a <a href="Eschatocol">conclusion</a>, and a signatory section. The preamble declares that the states "agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union."
What follows here summarizes the purpose and content of each of the thirteen articles.

While still at war with Britain, the revolution's leaders were divided between forming a national government with powers either strong and centralized (the "federalists"), or strictly limited (the "anti federalists"). The Continental Congress compromised by dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states. It empowered Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, but provided no mechanism to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, or even food.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris (1783)</a>, which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it. Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance. In September 1783, George Washington complained that Congress was paralyzed. Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.

The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>, and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:

The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783‚Äì84. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union. Knox wrote:

As Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, "As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution."

Once the war had been won, the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> defused the <a href="Newburgh%20conspiracy">Newburgh conspiracy</a>, but riots by unpaid <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.

The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.

Even after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1789, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a>, wrote to <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>, "It will be said there is no money in the treasury. There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth. The states must see the rod.‚Äù

Furthermore, the <a href="Jay%E2%80%93Gardoqui%20Treaty">Jay‚ÄìGardoqui Treaty</a> with <a href="Spain">Spain</a> in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy. In this treaty ‚Äî which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity ‚Äî the United States was to give up rights to use the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the <a href="British%20army">British army</a> to leave frontier forts which were on American soil ‚Äî forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a>s and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris (1783)</a> was superseded by the implementation of <a href="Jay%27s%20Treaty">Jay's Treaty</a> in 1795 under the new <a href="U.S.%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a>.

Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.

Congress was denied any powers of <a href="taxation">taxation</a>: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to <a href="John%20Jay">John Jay</a>, who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, "that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions." Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45¬†million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were "the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity." He argued that Americans should avoid having it said "that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent" or that "her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith." The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.

Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or <a href="interstate%20commerce">interstate commerce</a> and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.

Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact. The <a href="Land%20Ordinance%20of%201785">Land Ordinance of 1785</a> and <a href="Northwest%20Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a> created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.

The <a href="Land%20Ordinance%20of%201785">Land Ordinance of 1785</a> established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the <a href="township">township</a> (36 square miles), the <a href="Section%20%28United%20States%20land%20surveying%29">section</a> (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 <a href="acre">acre</a>s). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="California">California</a> that had already been surveyed and divided up by the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a>). Then, when the <a href="Homestead%20Act">Homestead Act</a> was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.

The <a href="Northwest%20Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a> of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up <a href="state%20cession">northwestern land claims</a>, organized the <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a> and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, eventually became the states of: <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, and <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, and the part of <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.

No new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763%E2%80%931791%29">Province of Quebec</a> (referred to as "Canada" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, ordinances to admit <a href="State%20of%20Franklin">Frankland</a> (later modified to Franklin), <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Vermont%20Republic">Vermont</a> to the Union were considered, but none were approved.

The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure. The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress‚Äîthe only federal institution‚Äîlittle power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president and no national court. Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.

By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity. However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786‚Äì87, <a href="Shays%27%20Rebellion">Shays' Rebellion</a>, an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.

The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression "not worth a continental". Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States. Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.

When <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce. Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.

By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping. State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit. Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.

The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor. <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress. Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the <a href="Annapolis%20Convention%20%281786%29">Annapolis Convention</a> in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.

The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Congress</a>. On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of <a href="Henry%20Laurens">Henry Laurens</a> and <a href="Charles%20Thomson">Charles Thomson</a>, who were the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Continental%20Congress">President</a> and Secretary to the Congress.

The Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.

On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> and <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> could not, since their states had not ratified. <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.

After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.

The other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims.
On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the <a href="Maryland%20General%20Assembly">Maryland General Assembly</a> in <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a>. As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, "among engrossed Bills" was "signed and sealed by Governor <a href="Thomas%20Sim%20Lee">Thomas Sim Lee</a> in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation" and perpetual union among the states. The Senate then adjourned "to the first Monday in August next." The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The confirmation signing of the Articles by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781, and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.

Congress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.
The signers and the states they represented were:
<a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>

<a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>

<a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>

<a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>

<a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts Bay</a>

<a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>
<a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>

<a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>

<a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>

<a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>

<a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a>

<a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>

<a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>
Roger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the <a href="Continental%20Association">Continental Association</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

Robert Morris (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

John Dickinson (Delaware), Daniel Carroll (Maryland) and Gouverneur Morris (New York), along with Sherman and Robert Morris, were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution (Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).

The following list is of those who led the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederation">Congress of the Confederation</a> under the Articles of Confederation as the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States%20in%20Congress%20Assembled">Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled</a>. Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the <a href="Committee%20of%20the%20States">Committee of the States</a> when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.

"For a full list of Presidents of the Congress Assembled and Presidents under the two Continental Congresses before the Articles, see <a href="President%20of%20the%20Continental%20Congress">President of the Continental Congress</a>."

On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>'s recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict. At what came to be known as the <a href="Annapolis%20Convention%20%281786%29">Annapolis Convention</a>, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a "Grand Convention." Although the states' representatives to the <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Convention</a> in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a <a href="republic">republic</a> as defined by the philosophers of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from "Federalist 39", describes the change this way:

In May 1786, <a href="Charles%20Pinckney%20%28governor%29">Charles Pinckney</a> of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after <a href="Shays%27%20Rebellion">Shays' Rebellion</a> threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.

Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a>, <a href="George%20Mason">George Mason</a>, and other <a href="Anti-Federalism">Anti-Federalists</a> who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:

Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.

Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures "stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace." The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.

When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new "merchant state," much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.

Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, <a href="John%20Jay">John Jay</a> of New York and <a href="Thomas%20Burke%20%28governor%29">Thomas Burke</a> of North Carolina believed that "the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges."

According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously: 
[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.

On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:
The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.

The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion. In 1788, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> remarked (in "<a href="Federalist%20No.%2040">Federalist No. 40</a>") that the issue had become moot: "As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation." Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground. At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply. Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.

Modern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus "other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule". In contrast, law professor <a href="Akhil%20Amar">Akhil Amar</a> suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.

On July 3, 1788, the Congress received <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>'s all-important ninth ratification of the proposed Constitution, thus, according to its terms, establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states. The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state. The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that, in light of this development, it would be "unadvisable" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so "under the Articles of Confederation" only, but not "under the Constitution".

By the end of July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution. Congress continued to convene under the Articles with a quorum until October. On Saturday, September 13, 1788, the Confederation Congress voted the resolve to implement the new Constitution, and on Monday, September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.

On that same September 13, it determined that New York would remain the national capital.

Atlantic Ocean

The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s with a total <a href="area">area</a> of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the <a href="Earth%27s%20surface">Earth's surface</a> and about 29 percent of its <a href="water">water</a> surface area. It separates the "<a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>" from the "<a href="New%20World">New World</a>".

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and <a href="Africa">Africa</a> to the east, and the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> to the west. As one component of the interconnected <a href="World%20Ocean">global ocean</a>, it is connected in the north to the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>, to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> in the southwest, the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> in the southeast, and the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>). The <a href="Equatorial%20Counter%20Current">Equatorial Counter Current</a> subdivides it into the North Atlantic Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean at about <a href="8th%20parallel%20north">8¬∞N</a>.

Scientific explorations of the Atlantic include the <a href="Challenger%20expedition">Challenger expedition</a>, the <a href="German%20Meteor%20expedition">German Meteor expedition</a>, <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>'s <a href="Lamont-Doherty%20Earth%20Observatory">Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Hydrographic%20Office">United States Navy Hydrographic Office</a>.

The oldest known mentions of an "Atlantic" sea come from <a href="Stesichorus">Stesichorus</a> around mid-sixth century BC (Sch. A. R. 1. 211): "Atlantikoi pel√°gei" (Greek: ·ºàœÑŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫·ø∑ œÄŒµŒªŒ¨Œ≥ŒµŒπ; English: 'the Atlantic sea'; etym. 'Sea of Atlantis') and in "<a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">The Histories</a>" of <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): "Atlantis thalassa" (Greek: ·ºàœÑŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑ·Ω∂œÇ Œ∏Œ¨ŒªŒ±œÉœÉŒ±; English: 'Sea of Atlantis' or 'the Atlantis sea') where the name refers to "the sea beyond the <a href="pillars%20of%20Heracles">pillars of Heracles</a>" which is said to be part of the ocean that surrounds all land. Thus, on one hand, the name refers to <a href="Atlas%20%28mythology%29">Atlas</a>, the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in Medieval maps and also lent his name to modern <a href="Atlas%20%28geography%29">atlases</a>. On the other hand, to early <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> sailors and in Ancient Greek mythological literature such as the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" and the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", this all-encompassing ocean was instead known as <a href="Oceanus">Oceanus</a>, the gigantic river that encircled the world; in contrast to the enclosed seas well-known to the Greeks: the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
In contrast, the term "Atlantic" originally referred specifically to the <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a> in Morocco and the sea off the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> and the North African coast. The Greek word "thalassa" has been reused by scientists for the huge <a href="Panthalassa">Panthalassa</a> ocean that surrounded the supercontinent <a href="Pangaea">Pangaea</a> hundreds of million years ago.

The term "<a href="Aethiopian%20Ocean">Aethiopian Ocean</a>", derived from <a href="Aethiopia">Ancient Ethiopia</a>, was applied to the Southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.

The <a href="International%20Hydrographic%20Organization">International Hydrographic Organization</a> (IHO) defined the limits of the oceans and seas in 1953, but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not used by various authorities, institutions, and countries, see for example the <a href="CIA%20World%20Factbook">CIA World Factbook</a>. Correspondingly, the extent and number of oceans and seas varies.

The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a>, <a href="Greenland%20Sea">Greenland Sea</a>, <a href="Norwegian%20Sea">Norwegian Sea</a> and <a href="Barents%20Sea">Barents Sea</a>. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are <a href="Europe">Europe</a>: the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> (where it connects with the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>‚Äìone of its <a href="marginal%20sea">marginal sea</a>s‚Äìand, in turn, the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, both of which also touch upon <a href="Asia">Asia</a>) and Africa.

In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The <a href="20th%20meridian%20east">20¬∞ East meridian</a>, running south from <a href="Cape%20Agulhas">Cape Agulhas</a> to <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> defines its border. In the 1953 definition it extends south to Antarctica, while in later maps it is bounded at the <a href="60th%20parallel%20south">60¬∞ parallel</a> by the Southern Ocean.

The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, <a href="Davis%20Strait">Davis Strait</a>, <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a>, part of the <a href="Drake%20Passage">Drake Passage</a>, <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, <a href="Labrador%20Sea">Labrador Sea</a>, <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, <a href="Norwegian%20Sea">Norwegian Sea</a>, almost all of the <a href="Scotia%20Sea">Scotia Sea</a>, and other tributary water bodies. Including these marginal seas the coast line of the Atlantic measures compared to for the Pacific.

Including its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers an area of or 23.5% of the global ocean and has a volume of or 23.3%. Excluding its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers and has a volume of . The North Atlantic covers (11.5%) and the South Atlantic (11.1%). The average depth is and the maximum depth, the <a href="Milwaukee%20Deep">Milwaukee Deep</a> in the <a href="Puerto%20Rico%20Trench">Puerto Rico Trench</a>, is .

The <a href="bathymetry">bathymetry</a> of the Atlantic is dominated by a <a href="Mid-ocean%20ridge">submarine mountain range</a> called the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a> (MAR). It runs from 87¬∞N or south of the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a> to the subantarctic <a href="Bouvet%20Island">Bouvet Island</a> at <a href="42nd%20parallel%20south">42¬∞S</a>.

The MAR divides the Atlantic longitudinally into two halves, in each of which a series of basins are delimited by secondary, transverse ridges. The MAR reaches above along most of its length, but is interrupted by larger transform faults at two places: the <a href="Romanche%20Trench">Romanche Trench</a> near the Equator and the <a href="Gibbs%20Fracture%20Zone">Gibbs Fracture Zone</a> at <a href="53rd%20parallel%20north">53¬∞N</a>. The MAR is a barrier for bottom water, but at these two transform faults deep water currents can pass from one side to the other.

The MAR rises above the surrounding ocean floor and its <a href="rift%20valley">rift valley</a> is the <a href="divergent%20boundary">divergent boundary</a> between the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20Plate">Eurasian</a> plates in the North Atlantic and the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American</a> and <a href="African%20Plate">African</a> plates in the South Atlantic. The MAR produces <a href="Basaltic%20lava">basaltic volcanoes</a> in <a href="Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallaj√∂kull</a>, Iceland, and <a href="pillow%20lava">pillow lava</a> on the ocean floor. The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep.

The MAR is intersected by two perpendicular ridges: the <a href="Azores%E2%80%93Gibraltar%20Transform%20Fault">Azores‚ÄìGibraltar Transform Fault</a>, the boundary between the <a href="Nubian%20Plate">Nubian</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20Plate">Eurasian plates</a>, intersects the MAR at the <a href="Azores%20Triple%20Junction">Azores Triple Junction</a>, on either side of the Azores microplate, near the <a href="40th%20parallel%20north">40¬∞N</a>. A much vaguer, nameless boundary, between the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American</a> and <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American</a> plates, intersects the MAR near or just north of the <a href="Fifteen-Twenty%20Fracture%20Zone">Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone</a>, approximately at <a href="16th%20parallel%20north">16¬∞N</a>.

In the 1870s, the <a href="Challenger%20expedition">Challenger expedition</a> discovered parts of what is now known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, or:

Most of the MAR runs under water but where it reaches the surfaces it has produced volcanic islands. While nine of these have collectively been nominated a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> for their geological value, four of them are considered of "Outstanding Universal Value" based on their cultural and natural criteria: <a href="%C3%9Eingvellir%20National%20Park">√ûingvellir</a>, Iceland; <a href="Landscape%20of%20the%20Pico%20Island%20Vineyard%20Culture">Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture</a>, Portugal; <a href="Gough%20and%20Inaccessible%20Islands">Gough and Inaccessible Islands</a>, United Kingdom; and Brazilian Atlantic Islands: <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a> and <a href="Atol%20das%20Rocas">Atol das Rocas</a> Reserves, Brazil.

Continental shelves in the Atlantic are wide off Newfoundland, southern-most South America, and north-eastern Europe.
In the western Atlantic <a href="carbonate%20platform">carbonate platform</a>s dominate large areas, for example the <a href="Blake%20Plateau">Blake Plateau</a> and <a href="Bermuda%20Rise">Bermuda Rise</a>.
The Atlantic is surrounded by <a href="passive%20margin">passive margin</a>s except at a few locations where <a href="active%20margin">active margin</a>s form deep <a href="oceanic%20trench">trenches</a>: the <a href="Puerto%20Rico%20Trench">Puerto Rico Trench</a> ( maximum depth) in the western Pacific and <a href="South%20Sandwich%20Trench">South Sandwich Trench</a> () in the South Atlantic. There are numerous submarine canyons off north-eastern North America, western Europe, and north-western Africa. Some of these canyons extend along the continental rises and farther into the abyssal plains as deep-sea channels.

In 1922 a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred. The USS Stewart used a Navy Sonic Depth Finder to draw a continuous map across the bed of the Atlantic. This involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straight forward with pulses being sent from the vessel, which bounce off the ocean floor, then return to the vessel. The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, <a href="abyssal%20plain">abyssal plain</a>s, <a href="oceanic%20trench">trenches</a>, <a href="seamount">seamount</a>s, <a href="Oceanic%20basin">basins</a>, <a href="Oceanic%20plateau">plateaus</a>, <a href="Submarine%20canyon">canyons</a>, and some <a href="guyot">guyot</a>s. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.

The mean depth between <a href="60th%20parallel%20north">60¬∞N</a> and <a href="60th%20parallel%20south">60¬∞S</a> is , or close to the average for the global ocean, with a modal depth between .

In the South Atlantic the <a href="Walvis%20Ridge">Walvis Ridge</a> and <a href="Rio%20Grande%20Rise">Rio Grande Rise</a> form barriers to ocean currents.
The <a href="Laurentian%20Abyss">Laurentian Abyss</a> is found off the eastern coast of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below to over . Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by .

From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the <a href="Labrador%20Sea">Labrador Sea</a>, <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a>, and Baltic Sea.

The <a href="Coriolis%20effect">Coriolis effect</a> circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. The south <a href="tide">tide</a>s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. In latitudes above <a href="40th%20parallel%20north">40¬∞ North</a> some east-west oscillation, known as the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20oscillation">North Atlantic oscillation</a>, occurs.

On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water <a href="salinity">salinity</a> in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 ‚Äì 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and <a href="sea%20ice">sea ice</a> melting influence surface salinity values. Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about <a href="25th%20parallel%20north">25¬∞ north</a> and <a href="25th%20parallel%20south">south</a>, in <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.

The high surface salinity in the Atlantic, on which the Atlantic <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> is dependent, is maintained by two processes: the <a href="Agulhas%20Current%23Agulhas%20leakage%20and%20rings">Agulhas Leakage/Rings</a>, which brings salty Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic, and the "Atmospheric Bridge", which evaporates subtropical Atlantic waters and exports it to the Pacific.

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major, upper <a href="water%20mass">water mass</a>es with distinct temperature and salinity. The Atlantic Subarctic Upper Water in the northern-most North Atlantic is the source for Subarctic Intermediate Water and North Atlantic Intermediate Water. North Atlantic Central Water can be divided into the Eastern and Western North Atlantic central Water since the western part is strongly affected by the Gulf Stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water. The eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to Mediterranean Water. North Atlantic Central Water flows into South Atlantic Central Water at <a href="15th%20parallel%20north">15¬∞N</a>.

There are five intermediate waters: four low-salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high-salinity formed through evaporation. Arctic Intermediate Water, flows from north to become the source for North Atlantic Deep Water south of the Greenland-Scotland sill. These two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins. The wide range of salinities in the North Atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources: Labrador Sea, Norwegian-Greenland Sea, Mediterranean, and South Atlantic Intermediate Water.

The <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Deep%20Water">North Atlantic Deep Water</a> (NADW) is a complex of four water masses, two that form by deep convection in the open ocean¬†‚Äî Classical and Upper Labrador Sea Water¬†‚Äî and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland sill¬†‚Äî Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water. Along its path across Earth the composition of the NADW is affected by other water masses, especially <a href="Antarctic%20Bottom%20Water">Antarctic Bottom Water</a> and Mediterranean Overflow Water.
The NADW is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern North Atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in Europe. Changes in the formation of NADW have been linked to global climate changes in the past. Since man-made substances were introduced into the environment, the path of the NADW can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from <a href="nuclear%20weapon%20test">nuclear weapon test</a>s in the 1960s and <a href="chlorofluorocarbon">CFCs</a>.

The clockwise warm-water <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Gyre">North Atlantic Gyre</a> occupies the northern Atlantic, and the counter-clockwise warm-water <a href="South%20Atlantic%20Gyre">South Atlantic Gyre</a> appears in the southern Atlantic.

In the North Atlantic surface circulation is dominated by three inter-connected currents: the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> which flows north-east from the North American coast at <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>; the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Current">North Atlantic Current</a>, a branch of the Gulf Stream which flows northward from the <a href="Grand%20Banks%20of%20Newfoundland">Grand Banks</a>; and the <a href="Subpolar%20Front">Subpolar Front</a>, an extension of the North Atlantic Current, a wide, vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre. This system of currents transport warm water into the North Atlantic, without which temperatures in the North Atlantic and Europe would plunge dramatically.
North of the North Atlantic Gyre, the cyclonic <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Subpolar%20Gyre">North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre</a> plays a key role in climate variability. It is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography, rather than being steered by wind, both in the deep ocean and at sea level.
The subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">thermohaline circulation</a>. Its eastern portion includes <a href="Eddy%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29">eddying</a> branches of the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Current">North Atlantic Current</a> which transport warm, saline waters from the subtropics to the north-eastern Atlantic. There this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of Greenland where they form an intense (40‚Äì50¬†<a href="Sverdrup">Sv</a>) current which flows around the continental margins of the <a href="Labrador%20Sea">Labrador Sea</a>. A third of this water become parts of the deep portion of the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Deep%20Water">North Atlantic Deep Water</a> (NADW). The NADW, in its turn, feed the <a href="meridional%20overturning%20circulation">meridional overturning circulation</a> (MOC), the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change. Large variations in the subpolar gyre on a decade-century scale, associated with the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20oscillation">North Atlantic oscillation</a>, are especially pronounced in <a href="Labrador%20Sea%20Water">Labrador Sea Water</a>, the upper layers of the MOC.

The South Atlantic is dominated by the anti-cyclonic southern subtropical gyre. The <a href="South%20Atlantic%20Central%20Water">South Atlantic Central Water</a> originates in this gyre, while <a href="Antarctic%20Intermediate%20Water">Antarctic Intermediate Water</a> originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region, near the <a href="Drake%20Passage">Drake Passage</a> and Falkland Islands. Both these currents receive some contribution from the Indian Ocean. On the African east coast the small cyclonic <a href="Angola%20Gyre">Angola Gyre</a> lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre.
The southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by a wind-induced <a href="Ekman%20layer">Ekman layer</a>. The residence time of the gyre is 4.4‚Äì8.5¬†years. <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Deep%20Water">North Atlantic Deep Water</a> flows southerward below the <a href="thermocline">thermocline</a> of the subtropical gyre.

The Sargasso Sea in the western North Atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of "<a href="Sargassum">Sargassum</a>" ("S. fluitans" and "natans") float, an area wide and encircled by the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Drift">North Atlantic Drift</a>, and <a href="North%20Equatorial%20Current">North Equatorial Current</a>. This population of seaweed probably originated from Tertiary ancestors on the European shores of the former <a href="Tethys%20Ocean">Tethys Ocean</a> and has, if so, maintained itself by <a href="Vegetative%20reproduction">vegetative growth</a>, floating in the ocean for millions of years.
Other species endemic to the Sargasso Sea include the <a href="sargassum%20fish">sargassum fish</a>, a predator with algae-like appendages who hovers motionless among the "Sargassum". Fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former Tethys Ocean, in what is now the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathian</a> region, that were similar to the Sargasso Sea. It is possible that the population in the Sargasso Sea migrated to the Atlantic as the Tethys closed at the end of the Miocene around 17¬†Ma.
The origin of the Sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries. The fossils found in the Carpathians in the mid-20th century, often called the "quasi-Sargasso assemblage", finally showed that this assemblage originated in the <a href="Carpathian%20Basin">Carpathian Basin</a> from were it migrated over <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> to the Central Atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the Sargasso Sea.

The location of the spawning ground for European eels <a href="Eel%20life%20history%23Search%20for%20the%20spawning%20grounds">remained unknown for decades</a>. In the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern Sargasso Sea is the spawning ground for both the <a href="European%20eel">European</a> and <a href="American%20eel">American eel</a> and that the former migrate more than and the latter . Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream transport eel larvae from the Sargasso Sea to foraging areas in North America, Europe, and Northern Africa. Recent but disputed research suggests that eels possibly use <a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field">Earth's magnetic field</a> to navigate through the ocean both as larvae and as adults.

Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">Precipitation</a> can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.

The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.

The <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> and its northern extension towards Europe, the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Current">North Atlantic Drift</a> is thought to have at least some influence on climate. For example, the Gulf Stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern North America, keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas. The Gulf Stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the Florida Peninsula. In the higher latitudes, the North Atlantic Drift, warms the atmosphere over the oceans, keeping the British Isles and north-western Europe mild and cloudy, and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude. The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the <a href="Grand%20Banks%20of%20Newfoundland">Grand Banks of Newfoundland</a> area) and Africa's north-western coast. In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas.

<a href="Iceberg">Iceberg</a>s are common from February to August in the <a href="Davis%20Strait">Davis Strait</a>, <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a>, and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> and <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>. Ships are subject to <a href="Superstructure%20%28ship%29">superstructure</a> <a href="icing%20%28nautical%29">icing</a> in the extreme north from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The United States' southeast coast, especially the Virginia and North Carolina coasts, has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs.

The <a href="Bermuda%20Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a> is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but <a href="Coast%20Guard">Coast Guard</a> records do not support this belief.

<a href="Hurricanes">Hurricanes</a> are also a natural hazard in the Atlantic, but mainly in the northern part of the ocean, rarely <a href="tropical%20cyclones">tropical cyclones</a> form in the southern parts. Hurricanes usually form annually between June and November.

The break-up of Pangaea began in the Central Atlantic, between North America and Northwest Africa, where rift basins opened during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic. This period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the Atlas Mountains. The exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from 200 to 170¬†Ma.

The opening of the Atlantic Ocean coincided with the initial break-up of the supercontinent <a href="Pangaea">Pangaea</a>, both of which were initiated by the eruption of the <a href="Central%20Atlantic%20Magmatic%20Province">Central Atlantic Magmatic Province</a> (CAMP), one of the most extensive and voluminous <a href="large%20igneous%20province">large igneous province</a>s in Earth's history associated with the <a href="Triassic%E2%80%93Jurassic%20extinction%20event">Triassic‚ÄìJurassic extinction event</a>, one of Earth's major <a href="extinction%20event">extinction event</a>s.
Theoliitic <a href="Dike%20%28geology%29">dikes</a>, <a href="Aquatic%20sill">sills</a>, and lava flows from the CAMP eruption at 200¬†Ma have been found in West Africa, eastern North America, and northern South America. The extent of the volcanism has been estimated to of which covered what is now northern and central Brazil.

The formation of the <a href="Central%20American%20Isthmus">Central American Isthmus</a> closed the <a href="Central%20American%20Seaway">Central American Seaway</a> at the end of the Pliocene 2.8¬†Ma ago. The formation of the isthmus resulted in the migration and extinction of many land-living animals, known as the <a href="Great%20American%20Interchange">Great American Interchange</a>, but the closure of the seaway resulted in a "Great American Schism" as it affected ocean currents, salinity, and temperatures in both the Atlantic and Pacific. Marine organisms on both sides of the isthmus became isolated and either diverged or went extinct.

Geologically the Northern Atlantic is the area delimited to the south by two conjugate margins, Newfoundland and Iberia, and to the north by the Arctic <a href="Eurasian%20Basin">Eurasian Basin</a>. The opening of the Northern Atlantic closely followed the margins of its predecessor, the <a href="Iapetus%20Ocean">Iapetus Ocean</a>, and spread from the Central Atlantic in six stages: <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberia</a>‚Äì<a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, <a href="Porcupine%20Bank">Porcupine</a>‚ÄìNorth America, Eurasia‚ÄìGreenland, Eurasia‚ÄìNorth America. Active and inactive spreading systems in this area are marked by the interaction with the <a href="Iceland%20hotspot">Iceland hotspot</a>.

West Gondwana (South America and Africa) broke up in the Early Cretaceous to form the South Atlantic. The apparent fit between the coastlines of the two continents was noted on the first maps that included the South Atlantic and it was also the subject of the first computer-assisted plate tectonic reconstructions in 1965. This magnificent fit, however, has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northward-propagating break-up. Intra-continental rifts and deformations have also been introduced to subdivide both continental plates into sub-plates.

Geologically the South Atlantic can be divided into four segments: Equatorial segment, from 10¬∞N to the Romanche Fracture Zone (RFZ);; Central segment, from RFZ to Florianopolis Fracture Zone (FFZ, north of Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise); Southern segment, from FFZ to the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone (AFFZ); and Falkland segment, south of AFFZ.

In the southern segment the Early Cretaceous (133‚Äì130¬†Ma) intensive magmatism of the <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20and%20Etendeka%20traps">Paran√°‚ÄìEtendeka Large Igneous Province</a> produced by the <a href="Tristan%20hotspot">Tristan hotspot</a> resulted in an estimated volume of . It covered an area of in Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay and in Africa. <a href="Dyke%20swarm">Dyke swarm</a>s in Brazil, Angola, eastern Paraguay, and Namibia, however, suggest the LIP originally covered a much larger area and also indicate failed rifts in all these areas. Associated offshore basaltic flows reach as far south as the Falkland Islands and South Africa. Traces of magmatism in both offshore and onshore basins in the central and southern segments have been dated to 147‚Äì49¬†Ma with two peaks between 143‚Äì121¬†Ma and 90‚Äì60¬†Ma.

In the Falkland segment rifting began with dextral movements between the Patagonia and Colorado sub-plates between the Early Jurassic (190¬†Ma) and the Early Cretaceous (126.7¬†Ma). Around 150¬†Ma sea-floor spreading propagated northward into the southern segment. No later than 130¬†Ma rifting had reached the Walvis Ridge‚ÄìRio Grande Rise.

In the central segment rifting started to break Africa in two by opening the <a href="Benue%20Trough">Benue Trough</a> around 118¬†Ma. Rifting in the central segment, however, coincided with the <a href="Geomagnetic%20reversal%23Superchrons">Cretaceous Normal Superchron</a> (also known as the Cretaceous quiet period), a 40¬†Ma period without magnetic reversals, which makes it difficult to date sea-floor spreading in this segment.

The equatorial segment is the last phase of the break-up, but, because it is located on the Equator, magnetic anomalies cannot be used for dating. Various estimates date the propagation of sea-floor spreading in this segment to the period 120‚Äì96¬†Ma. This final stage, nevertheless, coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in Africa.

About 50¬†Ma the opening of the <a href="Drake%20Passage">Drake Passage</a> resulted from a change in the motions and separation rate of the South American and Antarctic plates. First small ocean basins opened and a shallow gateway appeared during the Middle Eocene. 34‚Äì30¬†Ma a deeper seaway developed, followed by an <a href="Eocene%E2%80%93Oligocene%20extinction%20event">Eocene‚ÄìOligocene climatic deterioration</a> and the growth of the <a href="Antarctic%20ice%20sheet">Antarctic ice sheet</a>.

An embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of Gibraltar. The <a href="Gibraltar%20Arc">Gibraltar Arc</a> in the western Mediterranean is migrating westward into the Central Atlantic where it joins the converging African and Eurasian plates. Together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into a new subduction system in the eastern Atlantic Basin. Meanwhile, the <a href="Scotia%20Arc">Scotia Arc</a> and <a href="Caribbean%20Plate">Caribbean Plate</a> in the western Atlantic Basin are eastward-propagating subduction systems that might, together with the Gibraltar system, represent the beginning of the closure of the Atlantic Ocean and the final stage of the Atlantic <a href="Wilson%20Cycle">Wilson Cycle</a>.

<a href="Human%20evolution">Humans evolved</a> in Africa; first by diverging from other apes around 7¬†Ma; then developing stone tools around 2.6¬†Ma; to finally evolve as <a href="Anatomically%20modern%20human">modern humans</a> around 100¬†kya. The earliest evidences for the complex behavior associated with this <a href="behavioral%20modernity">behavioral modernity</a> has been found in the Greater <a href="Cape%20Floristic%20Region">Cape Floristic Region</a> (GCFR) along the coast of South Africa. During the latest glacial stages the now-submerged plains of the <a href="Agulhas%20Bank">Agulhas Bank</a> were exposed above sea level, extending the South African coastline farther south by hundreds of kilometers. A small population of modern humans¬†‚Äî probably fewer than a thousand reproducing individuals¬†‚Äî survived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these Palaeo-Agulhas plains. The GCFR is delimited to the north by the <a href="Cape%20Fold%20Belt">Cape Fold Belt</a> and the limited space south of it resulted in the development of social networks out of which complex Stone Age technologies emerged. Human history thus begins on the coasts of South Africa where the Atlantic <a href="Benguela%20Current">Benguela Upwelling</a> and Indian Ocean <a href="Agulhas%20Current">Agulhas Current</a> meet to produce an intertidal zone on which shellfish, fur seal, fishes and sea birds provided the necessary protein sources.
The African origin of this modern behaviour is evidenced by 70,000 years-old engravings from <a href="Blombos%20Cave">Blombos Cave</a>, South Africa.

<a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">Mitochondrial DNA</a> (mtDNA) studies indicate that 80‚Äì60,000 years ago a major demographic expansion within Africa, derived from a single, small population, coincided with the emergence of behavioral complexity and the rapid <a href="Marine%20isotope%20stage">MIS</a>¬†5‚Äì4 environmental changes. This group of people not only expanded over the whole of Africa, but also started to disperse <a href="Recent%20African%20origin%20of%20modern%20humans">out of Africa</a> into Asia, Europe, and Australasia around 65,000 years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in these regions. During the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">Last Glacial Maximum</a> (LGM) 20,000 years ago humans had to abandon their initial settlements along the European North Atlantic coast and retreat to the Mediterranean. Following rapid climate changes at the end of the LGM this region was repopulated by <a href="Magdalenian">Magdalenian</a> culture. Other hunter-gatherers followed in waves interrupted by large-scale hazards such as the <a href="Laacher%20See">Laacher See</a> volcanic eruption, the inundation of <a href="Doggerland">Doggerland</a> (now the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>), and the formation of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. The European coasts of the North Atlantic were permanently populated about 9‚Äì8.5 thousand years ago.

This human dispersal left abundant traces along the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean. 50¬†ka-old, deeply stratified <a href="shell%20midden">shell midden</a>s found in <a href="Ysterfontein">Ysterfontein</a> on the western coast of South Africa are associated with the Middle Stone Age (MSA). The MSA population was small and dispersed and the rate of their reproduction and exploitation was less intense than those of later generations. While their middens resemble 12‚Äì11¬†ka-old Late Stone Age (LSA) middens found on every inhabited continent, the 50‚Äì45¬†ka-old <a href="Enkapune%20Ya%20Muto">Enkapune Ya Muto</a> in Kenya probably represents the oldest traces of the first modern humans to disperse out of Africa.

The same development can be seen in Europe. In <a href="La%20Riera%20Cave">La Riera Cave</a> (23‚Äì13¬†ka) in Asturias, Spain, only some 26,600 molluscs were deposited over 10¬†ka. In contrast, 8‚Äì7¬†ka-old shell middens in Portugal, Denmark, and Brazil generated thousands of tons of debris and artefacts. The <a href="Erteb%C3%B8lle%20culture">Erteb√∏lle</a> middens in Denmark, for example, accumulated of shell deposits representing some 50 million molluscs over only a thousand years. This intensification in the exploitation of marine resources has been described as accompanied by new technologies¬†‚Äî such as boats, harpoons, and fish-hooks¬†‚Äî because many caves found in the Mediterranean and on the European Atlantic coast have increased quantities of marine shells in their upper levels and reduced quantities in their lower. The earliest exploitation, however, took place on the now submerged shelves, and most settlements now excavated were then located several kilometers from these shelves. The reduced quantities of shells in the lower levels can represent the few shells that were exported inland.

During the LGM the <a href="Laurentide%20Ice%20Sheet">Laurentide Ice Sheet</a> covered most of northern North America while <a href="Beringia">Beringia</a> connected Siberia to Alaska. In 1973 late U.S. geoscientist <a href="Paul%20S.%20Martin">Paul S. Martin</a> proposed a "blitzkrieg" colonization of America by which <a href="Clovis%20culture">Clovis hunters</a> migrated into North America around 13,000 years ago in a single wave through an ice-free corridor in the ice sheet and "spread southward explosively, briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey." Others later proposed a "three-wave" migration over the <a href="Bering%20Land%20Bridge">Bering Land Bridge</a>. These hypotheses remained the long-held view regarding the <a href="settlement%20of%20the%20Americas">settlement of the Americas</a>, a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries: the oldest archaeological sites in the Americas have been found in South America; sites in north-east Siberia report virtually no human presence there during the LGM; and most Clovis artefacts have been found in eastern North America along the Atlantic coast. Furthermore, colonisation models based on mtDNA, <a href="yDNA">yDNA</a>, and <a href="atDNA">atDNA</a> data respectively support neither the "blitzkrieg" nor the "three-wave" hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results. Contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will, eventually, confirm each other. A proposed route across the Pacific to South America could explain early South American finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path, through the Canadian Arctic and down the North American Atlantic coast.
Early settlements across the Atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories, ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed, including the <a href="Solutrean%20hypothesis">Solutrean hypothesis</a> and some of the <a href="Pre-Columbian%20trans-oceanic%20contact%20theories">Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories</a>.
The <a href="Norse%20colonization%20of%20North%20America">Norse settlement</a> of the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a> and <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> began during the 9th and 10th centuries. A settlement on <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> was established before 1000¬†CE, but contact with it was lost in 1409 and it was finally abandoned during the early <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a>. This setback was caused by a range of factors: an unsustainable economy resulted in erosion and denudation, while conflicts with the local <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> resulted in the failure to adapt their Arctic technologies; a colder climate resulted in starvation; and the colony got economically marginalized as the <a href="Great%20Plague">Great Plague</a> and <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a> harvested its victims on Iceland in the 15th century.
Iceland was initially settled 865‚Äì930¬†CE following a warm period when winter temperatures hovered around which made farming favorable at high latitudes. This did not last, however, and temperatures quickly dropped; at 1080¬†CE summer temperatures had reached a maximum of . The "<a href="Landn%C3%A1mab%C3%B3k">Landn√°mab√≥k</a>" ("Book of Settlement") records disastrous famines during the first century of settlement¬†‚Äî "men ate foxes and ravens" and "the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs"¬†‚Äî and by the early 1200s hay had to be abandoned for short-season crops such as barley.

<a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> <a href="Voyages%20of%20Christopher%20Columbus">discovered the Americas</a> in 1492 under Spanish flag. Six years later <a href="Vasco%20da%20Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> reached India under Portuguese flag, by navigating south around the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>, thus proving that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are connected. In 1500, in his voyage to India following Vasco da Gama, <a href="Pedro%20Alvares%20Cabral">Pedro Alvares Cabral</a> reached Brazil, taken by the currents of the <a href="South%20Atlantic%20Gyre">South Atlantic Gyre</a>. Following these explorations, Spain and Portugal quickly <a href="Colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">conquered and colonized</a> large territories in the New World and forced the Native American population into slavery in order to explore the vast quantities of silver and gold they found. Spain and Portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other European nations out, but conflicting interests nevertheless lead to a series of Spanish-Portuguese wars. A peace treaty mediated by the Pope divided the conquered territories into Spanish and Portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away. England, France, and the Dutch Republic enviously watched the Spanish and Portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with <a href="Piracy%20in%20the%20Atlantic%20World">pirates</a> such as <a href="Henry%20Mainwaring">Henry Mainwaring</a> and <a href="Alexandre%20Exquemelin">Alexandre Exquemelin</a>. They could explore the convoys leaving America because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable.
In the American colonies depredation, disease, and slavery quickly reduced the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous American population</a> to the extent that the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> had to be introduced to replace them¬†‚Äî a trade that became norm and an integral part of the colonization. Between the 15th century and 1888, when <a href="Slavery%20in%20Brazil">Brazil</a> became the last part of America to end slave trade, an estimated ten million Africans were exported as slaves, most of them destined for agricultural labour. The slave trade was officially abolished in the <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20British%20Isles">British Empire</a> and the <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States</a> in 1808, and slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire in 1838 and in the U.S. in 1865 after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>.

From Columbus to the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> Trans-Atlantic trade, including colonialism and slavery, became crucial for Western Europe. For European countries with a direct access to the Atlantic (including Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) 1500‚Äì1800 was a period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in Eastern Europe and Asia. Colonialism evolved as part of the Trans-Atlantic trade, but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs. Growth was more rapid in non-absolutist countries, such as Britain and the Netherlands, and more limited in <a href="Absolute%20monarchy">absolutist monarchies</a>, such as Portugal, Spain, and France, where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies.

Trans-Atlantic trade also resulted in an increasing <a href="urbanisation">urbanization</a>: in European countries facing the Atlantic urbanization grew from 8% in 1300, 10.1% in 1500, to 24.5% in 1850; in other European countries from 10% in 1300, 11.4% in 1500, to 17% in 1850. Likewise, <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> doubled in Atlantic countries but rose by only 30% in the rest of Europe. By end of the 17th century the volume of the Trans-Atlantic trade had surpassed that of the Mediterranean trade.

The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> deposits in the <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s of the continental shelves.

The Atlantic harbors <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> and <a href="gas">gas</a> fields, <a href="fish">fish</a>, <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s (<a href="Pinniped">seals</a> and whales), <a href="sand">sand</a> and <a href="gravel">gravel</a> aggregates, <a href="placer%20deposit">placer deposit</a>s, <a href="polymetallic%20nodules">polymetallic nodules</a>, and precious stones.
Gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor, however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through. Currently, there is no cost-effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit.

Various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills, <a href="marine%20debris">marine debris</a>, and the <a href="incineration">incineration</a> of toxic wastes at sea.

The <a href="Continental%20shelf">shelves</a> of the Atlantic hosts one of the world's richest <a href="Wild%20fisheries">fishing resources</a>. The most productive areas include the <a href="Grand%20Banks%20of%20Newfoundland">Grand Banks of Newfoundland</a>, the <a href="Scotian%20Shelf">Scotian Shelf</a>, <a href="Georges%20Bank">Georges Bank</a> off <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>, the <a href="Bahama%20Banks">Bahama Banks</a>, the waters around Iceland, the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a>, the <a href="Bay%20of%20Fundy">Bay of Fundy</a>, the <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a> of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks.
Fisheries have, however, undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the Atlantic: fisheries in the Eastern Central and South-West Atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value, the rest of the Atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks. The third group, "continuously increasing trend since 1950", is only found in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific.
In the North-East Atlantic total catches decreased between the mid-1970s and the 1990s and reached 8.7 million tons in 2013. <a href="Blue%20whiting">Blue whiting</a> reached a 2.4 million tons peak in 2004 but was down to 628,000 tons in 2013. Recovery plans for cod, sole, and plaice have reduced mortality in these species. <a href="Arctic%20cod">Arctic cod</a> reached its lowest levels in the 1960s‚Äì1980s but is now recovered. <a href="Pollachius%20virens">Arctic saithe</a> and <a href="haddock">haddock</a> are considered fully fished; <a href="Sand%20eel">Sand eel</a> is overfished as was <a href="capelin">capelin</a> which has now recovered to fully fished. Limited data makes the state of <a href="redfish">redfish</a>es and deep-water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing. Stocks of <a href="northern%20shrimp">northern shrimp</a> and <a href="Norwegian%20lobster">Norwegian lobster</a> are in good condition. In the North-East Atlantic 21% of stocks are considered overfished.
In the North-West Atlantic landings have decreased from 4.2 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013. During the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including <a href="Greenland%20halibut">Greenland halibut</a>, <a href="yellowtail%20flounder">yellowtail flounder</a>, <a href="Atlantic%20halibut">Atlantic halibut</a>, <a href="haddock">haddock</a>, <a href="spiny%20dogfish">spiny dogfish</a>, while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, <a href="Witch%20%28righteye%20flounder%29">witch flounder</a>, and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.

In 1497 <a href="John%20Cabot">John Cabot</a> became the first to explore mainland North America and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of <a href="Atlantic%20cod">Atlantic cod</a> off Newfoundland. Referred to as "Newfoundland Currency" this discovery supplied mankind with some 200¬†million tons of fish over five centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit <a href="haddock">haddock</a>, <a href="mackerel">mackerel</a>, and <a href="lobster">lobster</a>. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as <a href="Sebastes">redfish</a>, <a href="Greenland%20halibut">Greenland halibut</a>, witch flounder, and <a href="Grenadiers%20%28fish%29">grenadiers</a>. <a href="Overfishing">Overfishing</a> in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on <a href="international%20waters">international waters</a>, it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made. In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the <a href="collapse%20of%20the%20Atlantic%20northwest%20cod%20fishery">collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery</a>. The population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process, including <a href="American%20plaice">American plaice</a>, redfish, and Greenland halibut, together with flounder and grenadier.

In the Eastern Central Atlantic small <a href="pelagic%20fish">pelagic fish</a>es constitute about 50% of landings with sardine reaching 0.6‚Äì1.0 million tons per year. Pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fishes or overfished, with sardines south of <a href="Cape%20Bojador">Cape Bojador</a> the notable exception. Almost half of stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels. Total catches have been fluctuating since the 1970s; reaching 3.9 million tons in 2013 or slightly less than the peak production in 2010.
In the Western Central Atlantic catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 1.3 million tons in 2013. The most important species in the area, <a href="Gulf%20menhaden">Gulf menhaden</a>, reached a million tons in the mid-1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished. <a href="Round%20sardinella">Round sardinella</a> was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished. <a href="Grouper">Grouper</a>s and <a href="Lutjanidae">snappers</a> are overfished and <a href="northern%20brown%20shrimp">northern brown shrimp</a> and <a href="Eastern%20oyster">American cupped oyster</a> are considered fully fished approaching overfished. 44% of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels.
In the South-East Atlantic catches have decreased from 3.3 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.3 million tons in 2013. <a href="Horse%20mackerel">Horse mackerel</a> and <a href="hake">hake</a> are the most important species, together representing almost half of the landings. Off South Africa and Namibia <a href="Merluccius%20paradoxus">deep-water hake</a> and <a href="Merluccius%20capensis">shallow-water Cape hake</a> have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of <a href="Southern%20African%20pilchard">Southern African pilchard</a> and <a href="Southern%20African%20anchovy">anchovy</a> have improved to fully fished in 2013.

In the South-West Atlantic a peak was reached in the mid-1980s and catches now fluctuate between 1.7 and 2.6 million tons. The most important species, the <a href="Illex%20argentinus">Argentine shortfin squid</a>, which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value, is considered fully fished to overfished. Another important species was the <a href="Brazilian%20sardinella">Brazilian sardinella</a>, with a production of 100,000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished. Half the stocks in this area are being fished at unsustainable levels: <a href="Whitehead%E2%80%99s%20round%20herring">Whitehead‚Äôs round herring</a> has not yet reached fully fished but <a href="Cunene%20horse%20mackerel">Cunene horse mackerel</a> is overfished. The sea snail <a href="Haliotis%20midae">perlemoen abalone</a> is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished.

Endangered marine species include the <a href="manatee">manatee</a>, <a href="Pinniped">seals</a>, <a href="sea%20lion">sea lion</a>s, <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s, and <a href="whale">whale</a>s. <a href="Drift%20net">Drift net</a> fishing can kill <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s, <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es and other seabirds (<a href="petrel">petrel</a>s, <a href="auk">auk</a>s), hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes. Municipal pollution comes from the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; <a href="oil%20pollution">oil pollution</a> in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, <a href="Lake%20Maracaibo">Lake Maracaibo</a>, <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, and <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.

North Atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature (SST) at tropical latitudes, changes that can be attributed to either the natural <a href="Atlantic%20Multidecadal%20Oscillation">Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation</a> (AMO) or to <a href="anthropogenic%20climate%20change">anthropogenic climate change</a>.
A 2005 report indicated that the Atlantic <a href="meridional%20overturning%20circulation">meridional overturning circulation</a> (AMOC) slowed down by 30% between 1957 and 2004.
If the AMO was responsible for SST variability then the AMOC would have increased in strength, which is apparently not the case. Furthermore, it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity. Therefore, these changes in SST must be caused by human activities.

The ocean <a href="mixed%20layer">mixed layer</a> plays an important role heat storage over seasonal and decadal time-scales, whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and has a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer. This heat uptake provides a time-lag for climate change but it also results in a thermal expansion of the oceans which contribute to sea-level rise. 21st century global warming will probably result in an <a href="equilibrium%20level">equilibrium sea-level</a> rise five times greater than today, whilst melting of glaciers, including that of the Greenland ice-sheet, expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century, will probably result in a sea-level rise of 3‚Äì6¬†m over a millennium.

On 7 June 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

<a href="Marine%20pollution">Marine pollution</a> is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a> chemicals as well as <a href="livestock">livestock</a> and <a href="human">human</a> waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to <a href="Hypoxia%20%28environmental%29">hypoxia</a> and the creation of a <a href="dead%20zone%20%28ecology%29">dead zone</a>.

<a href="Marine%20debris">Marine debris</a>, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of <a href="Oceanic%20gyres">gyres</a> and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.

Arthur Schopenhauer

Arthur Schopenhauer (; ; 22 February 1788¬†‚Äì 21 September 1860) was a German <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>. He is best known for his 1818 work "<a href="The%20World%20as%20Will%20and%20Representation">The World as Will and Representation</a>" (expanded in 1844), wherein he characterizes the <a href="phenomenology%20%28philosophy%29">phenomenal</a> world as the product of a blind and insatiable <a href="%23Philosophy_of_the_.22Will.22">metaphysical will</a>. Proceeding from the <a href="transcendental%20idealism">transcendental idealism</a> of <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, Schopenhauer developed an <a href="atheistic">atheistic</a> metaphysical and ethical system that has been described as an exemplary manifestation of <a href="philosophical%20pessimism">philosophical pessimism</a>, rejecting the contemporaneous <a href="post-Kantian%20thought">post-Kantian philosophies</a> of <a href="German%20idealism">German idealism</a>. Schopenhauer was among the first thinkers in <a href="Western%20philosophy">Western philosophy</a> to share and affirm significant tenets of <a href="Eastern%20philosophy">Eastern philosophy</a> (e.g., <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a>, the world-as-<a href="appearance%20%28philosophy%29">appearance</a>), having initially arrived at similar conclusions as the result of his own philosophical work.

Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his life, Schopenhauer has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science. His writing on <a href="Schopenhauer%27s%20aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, <a href="morality">morality</a>, and <a href="psychology">psychology</a> would exert important influence on thinkers and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Those who have cited his influence include <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schr√∂dinger</a>, <a href="Otto%20Rank">Otto Rank</a>, <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Mann">Thomas Mann</a>, <a href="Emile%20Zola">Emile Zola</a>, <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>, <a href="Guy%20de%20Maupassant">Guy de Maupassant</a>, <a href="Jorge%20Luis%20Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>.

Schopenhauer was born on 22 February 1788, in the city of Danzig (then part of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth</a>; present day <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gda≈Ñsk</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>) on Heiligegeistgasse (known in the present day as ≈öw. Ducha 47), the son of <a href="Johanna%20Schopenhauer">Johanna Schopenhauer</a> (n√©e Trosiener) and Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, both descendants of wealthy German <a href="Patrician%20%28post-Roman%20Europe%29">patrician</a> families. When Danzig became part of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> in 1793, Heinrich moved to Hamburg, although his firm continued trading in Danzig. As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute. In 1805, Schopenhauer's father died, possibly by suicide. Arthur endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant in honor of his dead father, but his mother soon moved with his sister <a href="Adele%20Schopenhauer">Adele</a> to <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>‚Äîthen the centre of <a href="German%20literature">German literature</a>‚Äîto pursue her writing career. He dedicated himself wholly to studies at the <a href="Gotha">Gotha</a> <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">gymnasium</a> () in <a href="Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg">Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg</a>, but left in disgust after seeing one of the masters lampooned.
By that time, Johanna Schopenhauer had already opened her famous salon, and Arthur was not compatible with what he considered its vain and ceremonious ways. He was also disgusted by the ease with which his mother had forgotten his father's memory. He left to become a student at the <a href="Georg%20August%20University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of G√∂ttingen</a> in 1809. There he studied <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> and <a href="psychology">psychology</a> under <a href="Gottlob%20Ernst%20Schulze">Gottlob Ernst Schulze</a>, the author of "<a href="Aenesidemus%20%28book%29">Aenesidemus</a>", who advised him to concentrate on <a href="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>. In Berlin, from 1811 to 1812, he had attended lectures by the prominent <a href="post-Kantian">post-Kantian</a> philosopher <a href="Johann%20Gottlieb%20Fichte">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</a> and the theologian <a href="Friedrich%20Schleiermacher">Friedrich Schleiermacher</a>.

Schopenhauer had a notably strained relationship with his mother <a href="Johanna%20Schopenhauer">Johanna</a>. He wrote his first book, "<a href="On%20the%20Fourfold%20Root%20of%20the%20Principle%20of%20Sufficient%20Reason">On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason</a>", while at university. His mother informed him that the book was incomprehensible and it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur Schopenhauer told her that his work would be read long after the "rubbish" she wrote would have been totally forgotten. In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the <a href="F.A.%20Brockhaus%20AG">Brockhaus publishing firm</a> held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well. Hans Brockhaus later recalled that, when she brought them some of her son's work, his predecessors "saw nothing in this manuscript, but wanted to please one of our best-selling authors by publishing her son's work. We published more and more of her son Arthur's work and today nobody remembers Johanna, but her son's works are in steady demand and contribute to Brockhaus'[s] reputation." He kept large portraits of the pair in his office in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> for the edification of his new editors.

In 1814, Schopenhauer began his seminal work "<a href="The%20World%20as%20Will%20and%20Representation">The World as Will and Representation</a>" ("Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung"). He finished it in 1818 and <a href="F.A.%20Brockhaus%20AG">Brockhaus</a> published it that December. In <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> in 1819, Schopenhauer fathered, with a servant, an illegitimate daughter who was born and died the same year. In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">University of Berlin</a>. He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher <a href="G.%20W.%20F.%20Hegel">G. W. F. Hegel</a>, whom Schopenhauer described as a "clumsy charlatan". However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of <a href="academia">academia</a>. A late essay, "On University Philosophy", expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.

While in Berlin, Schopenhauer was named as a defendant in a lawsuit initiated by a woman named Caroline Marquet. She asked for damages, alleging that Schopenhauer had pushed her. According to Schopenhauer's court testimony, she deliberately annoyed him by raising her voice while standing right outside his door. Marquet alleged that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway. Her companion testified that she saw Marquet prostrate outside his apartment. Because Marquet won the lawsuit, Schopenhauer made payments to her for the next twenty years. When she died, he wrote on a copy of her death certificate, "Obit anus, abit onus" ("The old woman dies, the burden is lifted"). In 1819 the fortunes of his mother and sister, and himself, were threatened by the failure of the firm in Danzig in which his father had been a director and shareholder. His sister accepted a compromise compensation package of 70 per cent, but Schopenhauer angrily refused this, and eventually recovered 9400 thalers.

In 1821, he fell in love with nineteen-year-old opera singer, <a href="Caroline%20Medon">Caroline Richter</a> (called Medon), and had a relationship with her for several years, but did not marry her. When he was forty-three years old, he took interest in seventeen-year-old Flora Weiss but she rejected him as recorded in her diary.
In 1831, a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemic broke out in Berlin and Schopenhauer left the city. Schopenhauer settled permanently in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> in 1833, where he remained for the next twenty-seven years, living alone except for a succession of pet poodles named <a href="%C4%80tman%20%28Hinduism%29">Atman</a> and Butz. The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published <a href="Posthumous%20publication">posthumously</a> under the title "Senilia". Schopenhauer had a robust constitution, but in 1860 his health began to deteriorate. He died of <a href="Respiratory%20failure">pulmonary-respiratory failure</a>, on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch. He was 72.

A key focus of Schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation. Before Schopenhauer, Hegel had popularized the concept of "<a href="Zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a>", the idea that society consisted of a <a href="collective%20consciousness">collective consciousness</a> that moved in a distinct direction, dictating the actions of its members. Schopenhauer, a reader of both Kant and Hegel, criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason. Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires, or ("Will to Live"), which directed all of mankind. Will, for Schopenhauer, is what Kant called the "<a href="Noumenon">thing-in-itself</a>".

For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: "Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants." In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: "The world is "for" a subject." This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of <a href="Descartes">Descartes</a> and <a href="George%20Berkeley">Berkeley</a>. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena‚Äîan evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a> and chastity. He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: "The world is my representation." <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.

For Schopenhauer, human desiring, "willing", and craving cause <a href="suffering">suffering or pain</a>. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to <a href="Zapffe">Zapffe</a>'s ""Sublimation""). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain‚Äîalbeit temporarily‚Äîbecause it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ""one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception"" ("The World as Will and Representation", section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ""subject of cognition"" to a perception that is ""Pure, will-less, timeless"" (section 34) where the essence, "ideas", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to Daniel Albright, "Schopenhauer thought that <a href="philosophy%20of%20music">music</a> was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself".

He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.

Schopenhauer's <a href="Philosophy%20of%20mathematics%23Mathematical%20realism">realist</a> views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporary attempts to prove the <a href="parallel%20postulate">parallel postulate</a> in <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">Euclidean geometry</a>. Writing shortly before the discovery of <a href="hyperbolic%20geometry">hyperbolic geometry</a> demonstrated the logical independence of the axiom‚Äîand long before the <a href="general%20theory%20of%20relativity">general theory of relativity</a> revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space‚ÄîSchopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect <a href="concept">concept</a>s to prove what he held to be directly evident from <a href="perception">perception</a>.
Throughout his writings, Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.

Although Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.
This follows <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a>'s reasoning.

Schopenhauer's moral theory proposed that only <a href="compassion">compassion</a> can drive moral acts. According to Schopenhauer, compassion alone is the good of the object of the acts, that is, they cannot be inspired by either the prospect of personal utility or the feeling of duty. Mankind can also be guided by <a href="Ethical%20egoism">egoism</a> and <a href="wikt%3Amalice">malice</a>. Egotistic acts are those guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness. Schopenhauer believed most of our deeds belong to this class. Acts of malice are different from egotistic acts. As in the case of acts of compassion, these do not target personal utility. Their aim is to cause damage to others, independently of personal gains. He believed, like <a href="Swami%20Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a> in the unity of all with one-self and also believed that ego is the origin of pain and conflicts, that reduction of ego frames the moral principles.

According to Schopenhauer, whenever we make a choice, "We assume as necessary that decision was preceded by something from which it ensued, and which we call the ground or reason, or more accurately the motive, of the resultant action." Choices are not made freely. Our actions are necessary and determined because "every human being, even every animal, after the motive has appeared, must carry out the action which alone is in accordance with his inborn and immutable character". A definite action inevitably results when a particular motive influences a person's given, unchangeable character.
The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing "beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined..."

Should capital punishment be legal? "For safeguarding the lives of citizens," he asserted, "capital punishment is therefore absolutely necessary". "The murderer," wrote Schopenhauer, "who is condemned to death according to the law must, it is true, be now used as a mere "means", and with complete right. For public security, which is the principal object of the State, is disturbed by him; indeed it is abolished if the law remains unfulfilled. The murderer, his life, his person, must be the "means" of fulfilling the law, and thus of re-establishing public security." Schopenhauer disagreed with those who would abolish capital punishment. "Those who would like to abolish it should be given the answer: 'First remove murder from the world, and then capital punishment ought to follow.

People, according to Schopenhauer, cannot be improved. They can only be influenced by strong motives that overpower criminal motives. Schopenhauer declared that "real moral reform is not at all possible, but only determent from the deed...".

He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Hobbes</a>, <a href="Samuel%20von%20Pufendorf">Pufendorf</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Johann%20Anselm%20Ritter%20von%20Feuerbach">Anselm Feuerbach</a>. Schopenhauer declared that their teaching was corrupted by subsequent errors and therefore was in need of clarification.

Even though Schopenhauer ended his treatise on the freedom of human will with the postulate of everyone's responsibility for their character and, consequently, acts‚Äîthe responsibility following from one's being the Will as <a href="noumenon">noumenon</a> (from which also all the characters and creations come)‚Äîhe considered his views incompatible with <a href="theism">theism</a>, on grounds of <a href="fatalism">fatalism</a> and, more generally, responsibility for evil. Schopenhauer's philosophy is incompatible with the dogmas of Christianity, and the "Last Judgment" is no longer preceded by anything‚Äî"The world is itself the Last Judgment on it." Whereas God, if he existed, would be evil.

Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:

He named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life ("Wille zum Leben"), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive; a force that inveigles us into reproducing.

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within man's <a href="psyche%20%28psychology%29">psyche</a> and dramatically shaped the world:

These ideas foreshadowed the <a href="evolution">discovery of evolution</a>, <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freud's</a> concepts of the <a href="libido">libido</a> and the <a href="unconscious%20mind">unconscious mind</a>, and <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> in general.

Schopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in "Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik", available in English as two separate books, "<a href="On%20the%20Basis%20of%20Morality">On the Basis of Morality</a>" and "<a href="On%20the%20Freedom%20of%20the%20Will">On the Freedom of the Will</a>"). Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, "<a href="The%20World%20as%20Will%20and%20Representation">The World as Will and Representation</a>".

In occasional political comments in his "<a href="Parerga%20and%20Paralipomena">Parerga and Paralipomena</a>" and "Manuscript Remains", Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of <a href="limited%20government">limited government</a>. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should "leave each man free to work out his own <a href="salvation">salvation</a>", and so long as government was thus limited, he would "prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats"‚Äîi.e., by a <a href="monarch">monarch</a>, rather than a <a href="Republic">democrat</a>. Schopenhauer shared the view of <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one). He declared monarchy as "that which is natural to man" for "intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity" and disparaged republicanism as "unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences".

Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid "to political affairs of [his] day". In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of "minding not the times but the eternities". He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, "For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect."

Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern "white races" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus whom he saw as equal):

The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of "[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches" as "belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record".

Schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political <a href="anti-Judaism">anti-Judaism</a>. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the <a href="Aryan">Aryan</a>-<a href="Vedas">Vedic</a> theme of spiritual "self-conquest". This he saw as opposed to what he held to be the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly "Jewish" spirit:

While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.

In Schopenhauer's 1851 essay "On Women", he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" of reflexive unexamined reverence ("abgeschmackten Weiberveneration") for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that "Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted." He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to <a href="monogamy">monogamy</a>. Indeed, <a href="Nigel%20Rodgers">Rodgers</a> and <a href="Mel%20Thompson">Thompson</a> in "<a href="Philosophers%20Behaving%20Badly">Philosophers Behaving Badly</a>" call Schopenhauer "a misogynist without rival in...Western philosophy". He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey". The essay does give some compliments, however: that "women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.

Schopenhauer's controversial writings have influenced many, from <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> to nineteenth-century <a href="feminists">feminists</a>. Schopenhauer's <a href="biology">biological</a> analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by <a href="sociobiology">sociobiologists</a> and <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychologists</a>.

After the elderly Schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by <a href="Elisabet%20Ney">Elisabet Ney</a>, he told Richard Wagner's friend <a href="Malwida%20von%20Meysenbug">Malwida von Meysenbug</a>, "I have not yet spoken my last word about women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man."

Note for clarity in the following that "<a href="genetics">genetics</a>" are but one component of "<a href="heredity">heredity</a>". Though commonly used interchangeably, "heritable traits" would include socio-economic and other psycho-social potentialities.

Schopenhauer believed that personality and <a href="intellect">intellect</a> were inherited. He quotes Horace's saying, "From the brave and good are the brave descended" ("Odes", iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from "<a href="Cymbeline">Cymbeline</a>", "Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.
Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.
This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love ‚Äì placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the "final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake." This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:

With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his "Republic", he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could <a href="castrate">castrate</a> all <a href="criminals">scoundrels</a> and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole <a href="harem">harem</a>, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a>.

In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated his antidemocratic-eugenic thesis: "If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the <a href="despotism">despotism</a> of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by <a href="mating">mating</a> the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women. This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic." Analysts (e.g., Keith Ansell-Pearson) have suggested that Schopenhauer's advocacy of anti-<a href="egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a> and eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.

As a consequence of his <a href="Monism">monistic</a> philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals. For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word "will" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other. For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.

Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man.
Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.

The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.

In 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Animals">Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a>, and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun "it" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things. To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.

He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Spinoza's</a> belief that animals are to be used as a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.

In the third, expanded edition of "The World as Will and Representation" (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the "Metaphysics of Sexual Love". He also wrote that homosexuality did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that "the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils."

He wrote that only those who were too old or too young to reproduce strong, healthy children would resort to pederasty (Schopenhauer considered pederasty in itself a <a href="vice">vice</a>). Shrewdly anticipating the interpretive distortion, on the part of the popular mind, of his attempted scientific "explanation" of <a href="pederasty">pederasty</a> as personal "advocacy" (when he had otherwise described the act, in terms of spiritual ethics, as an "objectionable aberration"), Schopenhauer sarcastically concludes the appendix with the statement that "by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour, for they are very disconcerted by the ever-increasing publicization of my philosophy which they so carefully concealed. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty."

Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> texts, The <a href="Upanisad">Upanishads</a>, which French writer <a href="Abraham%20Hyacinthe%20Anquetil-Duperron">Anquetil du Perron</a> had translated from the Persian translation of Prince <a href="Dara%20Shikoh">Dara Shikoh</a> entitled "Sirre-Akbar" ("The Great Secret"). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them "the production of the highest human wisdom", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:

It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.

It is well known that the book "Oupnekhat" (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature "the greatest gift of our century", and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.

Schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813‚Äì1814 in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of <a href="Johann%20Gottfried%20Herder">Herder</a>, and an early <a href="Indologist">Indologist</a>. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>. This was through his neighbor of two years, <a href="Karl%20Christian%20Friedrich%20Krause">Karl Christian Friedrich Krause</a>. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned <a href="meditation">meditation</a> and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.

Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer‚Äôs work, was the significance of the <a href="Chandogya%20Upanishad">Chandogya Upanishad</a>, whose <a href="Mahavakya">Mahavakya</a>, <a href="Tat%20Tvam%20Asi">Tat Tvam Asi</a> is mentioned throughout "The World as Will and Representation".

Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the <a href="Four%20Noble%20Truths">Four Noble Truths</a> of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire (<a href="ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81">ta·πáhƒÅ</a>), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four "truths of the Buddha" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will. In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable ‚Äì it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.

For Schopenhauer, Will had <a href="ontology">ontological</a> primacy over the <a href="intellect">intellect</a>; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of <a href="puru%E1%B9%A3%C4%81rtha">puru·π£ƒÅrtha</a> or goals of life in <a href="Ved%C4%81nta">VedƒÅnta</a> <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>.

In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:

However, Buddhist <a href="nirv%C4%81%E1%B9%87a">nirvƒÅ·πáa</a> is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. NirvƒÅ·πáa is not the extinguishing of the "person" as some Western scholars have thought, but only the "extinguishing" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character. Occult historian <a href="Joscelyn%20Godwin">Joscelyn Godwin</a> (1945‚Äì ) stated, "It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>. This <a href="Orientalism">Orientalism</a> reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of <a href="Leon%20Poliakov">Leon Poliakov</a>, to "free themselves from <a href="Judeo-Christian">Judeo-Christian</a> fetters". In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions:
If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as "in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence" [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.
Buddhist philosopher <a href="Nishitani%20Keiji">Nishitani Keiji</a>, however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer. While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his <a href="methodology">methodology</a> was resolutely <a href="empirical">empirical</a>, rather than speculative or transcendental:
Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.
Also note:
This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.
The argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other <a href="Dharma">Dharmic</a> faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of "The World as Will and Representation" in 1818. Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence. Other scholarly work questions how similar Schopenhauer's philosophy actually is to Buddhism.

Schopenhauer said he was influenced by the <a href="Upanishads">Upanishads</a>, <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> and <a href="Plato">Plato</a>. References to <a href="Eastern%20philosophy">Eastern philosophy and religion</a> appear frequently in his writing. As noted above, he appreciated the teachings of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> and even called himself a Buddhist. He said that his philosophy could not have been conceived before these teachings were available.

Concerning the Upanishads and <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a>, he writes in "The World as Will and Representation":
If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.

Among Schopenhauer's other influences were: <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Reid">Thomas Reid</a>, <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a>, <a href="Matthias%20Claudius">Matthias Claudius</a>, <a href="George%20Berkeley">George Berkeley</a>, <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, and <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">Ren√© Descartes</a>.

Schopenhauer accepted Kant's double-aspect of the universe‚Äîthe <a href="phenomena">phenomena</a>l (world of experience) and the <a href="noumenon">noumenal</a> (the true world, independent of experience). Some commentators suggest that Schopenhauer claimed that the noumenon, or thing-in-itself, was the basis for Schopenhauer's concept of the <a href="will%20%28philosophy%29">will</a>. Other commentators suggest that Schopenhauer considered <a href="will%20%28philosophy%29">will</a> to be only a subset of the "thing-in-itself" class, namely that which we can most directly experience.

Schopenhauer's identification of the Kantian "noumenon" (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what he termed "will" deserves some explanation. The noumenon was what Kant called the "Ding an sich" (the Thing in Itself), the reality that is the foundation of our <a href="sense">sensory</a> and <a href="mind">mental</a> representations of an external world. In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon. According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed that phenomena and noumena are two different sides of the same coin. Noumena do not "cause" phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the <a href="principle%20of%20sufficient%20reason">principle of sufficient reason</a>. This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, "<a href="On%20the%20Fourfold%20Root%20of%20the%20Principle%20of%20Sufficient%20Reason">On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason</a>" (1813).

Schopenhauer's second major departure from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical <a href="philosophical%20skepticism">philosophical skepticism</a> of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.

We know our <a href="human%20anatomy">human bodies</a> have boundaries and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results‚Äîwe know this even if we do not understand the <a href="physics">physics</a> involved.

We know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually are not aware of the breathing of our <a href="human%20lung">lungs</a> or the beating of our <a href="human%20heart">heart</a> unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our <a href="liver">liver</a> is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.

When Schopenhauer identifies the "noumenon" with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name "will", what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will. We cannot "prove" that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know‚Äîwithout thinking‚Äîthat the world can stimulate us. We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay. The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion. That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena. It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the "noumenon" with what we call our will.

In his criticism of Kant, Schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities. Yet, for Kant, an object is known through each of them. Kant wrote: "[T]here are two stems of human knowledge ... namely, sensibility and understanding, objects being given by the former [sensibility] and thought by the latter [understanding]." Schopenhauer disagreed. He asserted that mere sense impressions, not objects, are given by sensibility. According to Schopenhauer, objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason (Kant had claimed that (1) the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that (2) reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to "why?"). Schopenhauer said that Kant's mistake regarding perception resulted in all of the obscurity and difficult confusion that is exhibited in the Transcendental Analytic section of his critique.

Lastly, Schopenhauer departed from Kant in how he interpreted the <a href="Platonic%20forms">Platonic ideas</a>. In "<a href="The%20World%20as%20Will%20and%20Representation">The World as Will and Representation</a>" Schopenhauer explicitly stated:

...Kant used the word [Idea] wrongly as well as illegitimately, although Plato had already taken possession of it, and used it most appropriately.

Instead Schopenhauer relied upon the <a href="Neoplatonist">Neoplatonist</a> interpretation of the biographer <a href="Diogenes%20La%C3%ABrtius">Diogenes La√´rtius</a> from "<a href="Lives%20and%20Opinions%20of%20Eminent%20Philosophers">Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</a>". In reference to Plato's Ideas, Schopenhauer quotes La√´rtius verbatim in an explanatory footnote.

Diogenes La√´rtius (III, 12) Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit subsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem consistencia.

Schopenhauer expressed his dislike for the philosophy of his contemporary <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a> many times in his published works. The following quotations are typical:

In his Foreword to the first edition of his work "Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik", Schopenhauer suggested that he had shown Hegel to have fallen prey to the "<a href="Post%20hoc%20ergo%20propter%20hoc">Post hoc ergo propter hoc</a>" fallacy.

Schopenhauer suggested that Hegel's works were filled with "castles of abstraction", and that Hegel used deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous verbiage. He also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with the search for philosophical <a href="truth">truth</a>. For instance, the <a href="Right%20Hegelians">Right Hegelians</a> interpreted Hegel as viewing the Prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then.

The British philosopher and historian <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> deemed Schopenhauer an insincere person, because judging by his life:

<a href="Bryan%20Magee">Bryan Magee</a> argues that "the answer to such shallow, but not uncommon criticism" is found in a quotation from Schopenhauer:

Schopenhauer has had a massive influence upon later thinkers, though more so in the <a href="arts">arts</a> (especially literature and music) and <a href="psychology">psychology</a> than in philosophy. His popularity peaked in the early twentieth century, especially during the <a href="Modernist">Modernist</a> era, and waned somewhat thereafter. Nevertheless, a number of recent publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer. His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to <a href="evolutionary%20theory">evolutionary theory</a> and modern evolutionary psychology.

Russian writer and philosopher <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> was greatly influenced by Schopenhauer. After reading Schopenhauer's "The World as Will and Representation", Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: "Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer"

<a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, writing in his autobiography, remembered his first impression that Schopenhauer left on him (when he read "World as Will and Representation"):

Wagner also commented on that "serious mood, which was trying to find ecstatic expression" created by Schopenhauer inspired the conception of Tristan und Isolde. See also <a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde%23Influence%20of%20Schopenhauer%20on%20Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde</a>.

<a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading "The World as Will and Representation" and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay "Schopenhauer als Erzieher" one of his "<a href="Untimely%20Meditations">Untimely Meditations</a>".

<a href="Jorge%20Luis%20Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.

As a teenager, <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he rejected epistemological idealism for <a href="Gottlob%20Frege">Gottlob Frege</a>'s conceptual realism. In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind... where real depth starts, his comes to an end."

The philosopher <a href="Gilbert%20Ryle">Gilbert Ryle</a> read Schopenhauer's works as a student, but later largely forgot them, only to unwittingly recycle ideas from Schopenhauer in his "<a href="The%20Concept%20of%20Mind">The Concept of Mind</a>" (1949).

Angola

Angola , officially the Republic of Angola ( ; <a href="Kikongo">Kikongo</a>, <a href="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a> and <a href="Umbundu">Umbundu</a>: "Repubilika ya Ngola"), is a <a href="country">country</a> in <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a>. It is the <a href="List%20of%20African%20countries%20by%20area">seventh-largest</a> country in <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and is bordered by <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> to the south, the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> to the north, <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> to the east, and the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to west. The <a href="exclave">exclave</a> province of <a href="Cabinda%20Province">Cabinda</a> has borders with the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> and the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>. The capital and largest city of Angola is <a href="Luanda">Luanda</a>.

Although its territory has been inhabited since the <a href="Paleolithic%20Era">Paleolithic Era</a>, what is now the modern country of Angola was influenced by <a href="Portuguese%20colonization%20of%20Africa">Portuguese colonisation</a>, which began with, and was for centuries limited to, coastal settlements and trading posts established beginning in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. As a <a href="Portuguese%20West%20Africa">Portuguese colony</a>, Angola did not encompass its present borders until the early 20th century, following resistance by groups such as the <a href="Cuamato">Cuamato</a>, the <a href="Oukwanyama">Kwanyama</a> and the <a href="Mbunda%20people">Mbunda</a>. Independence was achieved in 1975 under a <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Angola">Marxist-Leninist one party state</a>, backed by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> after a protracted <a href="Angolan%20War%20of%20Independence">anti-colonial struggle</a>. However, the country soon descended into an even lengthier <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> that lasted until 2002. It has since become a relatively stable <a href="Unitary%20state">unitary</a> <a href="presidential%20republic">presidential republic</a>.

Angola has vast <a href="Mineral%20reserve">mineral</a> and <a href="petroleum%20reserves">petroleum reserves</a>, and its economy is among the fastest growing in the world, especially since the cessation of the civil war. In spite of this, the standard of living remains low for the majority of the population, and <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> in Angola is among the lowest in the world, while <a href="infant%20mortality">infant mortality rates</a> are among the highest. Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with the majority of the nation's <a href="wealth%20concentration">wealth concentrated</a> in a disproportionately small sector of the population.

Angola is a member state of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, <a href="OPEC">OPEC</a>, <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a>, the <a href="Community%20of%20Portuguese%20Language%20Countries">Community of Portuguese Language Countries</a>, and the <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">Southern African Development Community</a>. A highly multiethnic country, Angola's 25.8 million people span various tribal groups, customs, and traditions. Angolan culture reflects centuries of Portuguese rule, namely in the predominance of the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese language</a> and the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, combined with diverse indigenous influences.

The name "Angola" comes from the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> colonial name "<a href="Angola%20%28Portugal%29">Reino de Angola</a> (Kingdom of Angola)", appearing as early as <a href="Dias%20de%20Novais">Dias de Novais</a>'s 1571 charter. The <a href="toponym">toponym</a> was derived by the Portuguese from the title "<a href="List%20of%20Ngolas%20of%20Ndongo">ngola</a>" held by the kings of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ndongo">Ndongo</a>. Ndongo was a kingdom in the highlands, between the <a href="Kwanza%20River">Kwanza</a> and <a href="Lukala%20River">Lukala River</a>s, nominally tributary to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kongo">king of Kongo</a> but which was seeking greater independence during the 16th century.

Modern Angola was populated predominantly by nomadic <a href="Khoi">Khoi</a> and <a href="San%20people">San</a> prior to the first <a href="Bantu%20migration">Bantu migration</a>s. The Khoi and San peoples were neither pastoralists nor cultivators, following a <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> lifestyle. They were displaced by <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu peoples</a> arriving from the north, most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and southern <a href="Niger">Niger</a>. Bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of <a href="banana">banana</a>s and <a href="taro">taro</a>, as well as large cattle herds, to Angola's central highlands and the Luanda plain.

During this time, the Bantu established a number of political entities in most of what today comprises Angola. The best known of these was the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Kongo">Kingdom of the Kongo</a>, which was based in Angola, but also extended northward to what is now <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> and the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a>, as well as <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>. It established trade routes with other city-states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western Africa and even with <a href="Great%20Zimbabwe">Great Zimbabwe</a> and the <a href="Mutapa%20Empire">Mutapa Empire</a> but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade. To its south lay the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ndongo">Kingdom of Ndongo</a>, from which the area of the later Portuguese colony was sometimes known as "Dongo".

The region, now known as Angola, was reached by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portuguese</a> <a href="Age%20of%20Discovery">explorer</a> <a href="Diogo%20C%C3%A3o">Diogo C√£o</a> in 1484. The year before, the Portuguese had established relations with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kongo">Kongo</a>, which stretched at the time from modern <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a> in the north to the <a href="Kwanza%20River">Kwanza River</a> in the south. The Portuguese established their primary early trading post at <a href="Soyo">Soyo</a>, which is now the northernmost city in Angola apart from the <a href="Cabinda%20Province">Cabinda</a> exclave. <a href="Paulo%20Dias%20de%20Novais">Paulo Dias de Novais</a> founded S√£o Paulo de Loanda (<a href="Luanda">Luanda</a>) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. <a href="Benguela">Benguela</a> was fortified in 1587 and elevated to a township in 1617.

The Portuguese established several other settlements, forts and trading posts along the Angolan coast, principally trading in <a href="Slavery%20in%20Angola">Angolan slaves</a> for <a href="Captaincies%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian</a> <a href="plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantations</a>. Local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a>, usually sold in exchange for manufactured goods from Europe. This part of the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> continued until after <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Brazil's</a> <a href="independence%20of%20Brazil">independence</a> in the 1820s.

Despite Portugal's territorial claims to Angola, its control over much of the country's vast interior was minimal. In the 16th century Portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars. Life for European colonists was difficult and progress proved to be slow. <a href="John%20Iliffe%20%28historian%29">Iliffe</a> notes that "Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great <a href="famine">famine</a> occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys".

During the <a href="Portuguese%20Restoration%20War">Portuguese Restoration War</a>, the <a href="Dutch%20West%20India%20Company">Dutch West India Company</a> <a href="Dutch%20Loango-Angola">occupied</a> the principal settlement of <a href="Luanda">Luanda</a> in 1641, using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against Portuguese holdings elsewhere. A fleet under <a href="Salvador%20de%20S%C3%A1">Salvador de S√°</a> retook Luanda in 1648; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650. New treaties with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kongo">Kongo</a> were signed in 1649; others with <a href="Nzinga%20of%20Ndongo%20and%20Matamba">Njinga</a>'s Kingdom of <a href="Matamba">Matamba</a> and <a href="Ndongo">Ndongo</a> followed in 1656. The conquest of <a href="Pungo%20Andongo">Pungo Andongo</a> in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited. Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s, Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory.

The slave trade was abolished in Angola in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves. Four years later, a more progressive administration appointed by Lisbon abolished slavery altogether. However, these decrees remained largely unenforceable, and the Portuguese were dependent on assistance from the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> to enforce their ban on the slave trade. This coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions on the hinterland, and by the mid-nineteenth century Portugal had established its dominion as far east as the <a href="Congo%20River">Congo River</a> and as far south as <a href="Moss%C3%A2medes">Moss√¢medes</a>. Until the late 1880s, Lisbon entertained proposals to link Angola with its colony in Mozambique, but was blocked by British and Belgian opposition. During this whole period, the Portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in Angola.

The <a href="Berlin%20Conference">Berlin Conference</a> in 1884-1885 fixed the colony's borders, delineating the boundaries of Portuguese claims to Angola., although many details were resolved afterwards, until the 1920s. Trade between Portugal and her African territories also rapidly increased as a result of protective tariffs, leading to increased development, as well as a wave of new Portuguese migrants.

Under colonial law, black Angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions. The first nationalist movements did not take root until after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, spearheaded by a largely Westernised, Portuguese-speaking urban class which included many <a href="mesti%C3%A7o">mesti√ßo</a>s. During the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from "ad hoc" labour activism in the rural workforce. Portugal's refusal to address increasing Angolan demands for self-determination provoked an armed conflict which erupted in 1961 with the <a href="Baixa%20de%20Cassanje%20revolt">Baixa de Cassanje revolt</a> and gradually evolved into a protracted <a href="Angolan%20War%20of%20Independence">war of independence</a> that persisted for the next twelve years. Throughout the conflict, three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the Portuguese government and local forces, supported to varying degrees by the <a href="Portuguese%20Communist%20Party">Portuguese Communist Party</a>.

The "<a href="FNLA">National Front for the Liberation of Angola</a>" (FNLA) recruited from <a href="Bakongo">Bakongo</a> refugees in <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a>. Benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in <a href="Kinshasha">L√©opoldville</a>, and especially from a common border with Zaire, Angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families, clans, and traditions. People on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical Kingdom of Kongo. Though as foreigners skilled Angolans could not take advantage of <a href="Mobutu%20Sese%20Seko">Mobutu Sese Seko</a>'s state employment programme, some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures. The migrants eventually formed the FNLA with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to Angola.

A largely <a href="Ovimbundu">Ovimbundu</a> guerrilla initiative against the Portuguese in central Angola from 1966 was spearheaded by <a href="Jonas%20Savimbi">Jonas Savimbi</a> and the "<a href="UNITA">National Union for the Total Independence of Angola</a>" (UNITA). It remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders, by the ethnic fragmentation of the Ovimbundu, and the isolation of peasants on European plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise.

Against the background of these simultaneous efforts, the rising of the Marxist-Leninist "<a href="MPLA">Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola</a>" (MPLA) in the east and Dembos hills north of Luanda came to hold special significance. Formed as a coalition resistance by the <a href="Angolan%20Communist%20Party">Angolan Communist Party</a>, the organisation's leadership remained predominantly <a href="Ambundu">Ambundu</a> and courted public sector workers in <a href="Luanda">Luanda</a>. Although both the MPLA and its rivals had accepted material assistance from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> or the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a>, the former harboured strong anti-imperialist views and was openly critical of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and its support for Portugal. This allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front, soliciting support from nonaligned governments in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>, <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, and the <a href="United%20Arab%20Republic">United Arab Republic</a>.

The MPLA attempted to move its headquarters from <a href="Conakry">Conakry</a> to L√©opoldville in October 1961, renewing efforts to create a common front with the FNLA, then known as the "Union of Angolan Peoples" (UPA) and its leader <a href="Holden%20Roberto">Holden Roberto</a>. Roberto turned down the offer. When the MPLA first attempted to insert its own insurgents into Angola, the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by UPA partisans on Roberto's orders‚Äîsetting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">Angolan Civil War</a>.

Throughout the war of independence, the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism, as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the Portuguese. Between 1961 and 1975 the MPLA, UNITA, and the FNLA competed for influence in the Angolan population and the international community. The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> became especially sympathetic towards the MPLA and supplied that party with arms, ammunition, funding, and training. They also backed UNITA militants until it became clear that the latter was at irreconcilable odds with the MPLA.

The collapse of Portugal's <a href="Estado%20Novo%20%28Portugal%29">Estado Novo</a> government following the 1974 <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> led to a suspension of all Portuguese military activities in Africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for Angolan independence. Encouraged by the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a>, Holden Roberto, Jonas Savimbi, and MPLA chairman <a href="Agostinho%20Neto">Agostinho Neto</a> met in <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a> in early January 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government. This was ratified by the <a href="Alvor%20Agreement">Alvor Agreement</a> later that month, which called for general elections and set the country's independence date for 11 November 1975. All three factions, however, followed up on the ceasefire by taking advantage of the gradual Portuguese withdrawal to seize various strategic positions, acquire more arms, and enlarge their militant forces. The rapid influx of weapons from numerous external sources, especially the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the escalation of tensions between the nationalist parties, fueled a new outbreak of hostilities. With tacit American and Zairean support the FNLA began massing large numbers of troops in northern Angola in an attempt to gain military superiority. Meanwhile, the MPLA began securing control of Luanda, a traditional Ambundu stronghold. Sporadic violence broke out in Luanda over the next few months after the FNLA attacked MPLA forces in March 1975. The fighting intensified with street clashes in April and May, and UNITA became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an MPLA contingent that June. An upswing in Soviet arms shipments to the MPLA influenced a decision by the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> to likewise provide substantial covert aid to the FNLA and UNITA.

In August 1975, the MPLA requested direct assistance from the Soviet Union in the form of ground troops. The Soviets declined, offering to send advisers but no troops; however, Cuba was more forthcoming and in late September dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to Angola, along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies. By independence there were over a thousand Cuban soldiers in the country. They were kept supplied by a massive <a href="Cuba%E2%80%93Angola%20airbridge">airbridge</a> carried out with Soviet aircraft. The persistent buildup of Cuban and Soviet military aid allowed the MPLA to drive its opponents from Luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by Zairean and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>n troops, which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the FNLA and UNITA. The FNLA was largely annihilated, although UNITA managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from Luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces. From there, Savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the MPLA.

Between 1975 and 1991, the MPLA implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of <a href="scientific%20socialism">scientific socialism</a>, incorporating <a href="Planned%20economy">central planning</a> and a <a href="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninist</a> <a href="one-party%20state">one-party state</a>. It embarked on an ambitious programme of <a href="Nationalization">nationalisation</a> and made a concerted attempt to eliminate the preexisting private sector. All locally owned enterprises in every sector of economic activity were subject to nationalisation by the state. These were then incorporated into a single umbrella of state-owned enterprises known as "Unidades Economicas Estatais" (UEE). Under the MPLA, Angola experienced a significant degree of modern <a href="industrialisation">industrialisation</a>. However, corruption and graft also increased as public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment. The ruling party survived an attempted coup d'√©tat by the <a href="Maoism">Maoist</a>-oriented <a href="Communist%20Organization%20of%20Angola">Communist Organisation of Angola</a> (OCA) in 1977, which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges that left thousands of OCA supporters dead.

The MPLA abandoned its former Marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990, and declared <a href="social%20democracy">social democracy</a> to be its new platform. Angola subsequently became a member of the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>; restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment. By May 1991 it had reached a peace agreement with UNITA, the <a href="Bicesse%20Accords">Bicesse Accords</a>, which scheduled <a href="Angolan%20general%20election%2C%201992">new general elections</a> for September 1992. When the MPLA secured a major electoral victory, UNITA objected to the results of both the presidential and legislative vote count and returned to war.

On 22 March 2002, Jonas Savimbi was killed in action against government troops. UNITA and the MPLA reached a cease-fire shortly afterwards. UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of a major opposition party. Although the political situation of the country began to stabilise, regular democratic processes did not prevail until the <a href="elections%20in%20Angola">elections in Angola</a> in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Angola">constitution</a> in 2010, all of which strengthened the prevailing <a href="dominant-party%20system">dominant-party system</a>.

Angola has a serious humanitarian crisis; the result of the prolonged war, of the abundance of <a href="minefield">minefield</a>s, of the continued political (and to a much lesser degree) military activities in favour of the independence of the <a href="exclave">exclave</a> of <a href="Cabinda%20%28province%29">Cabinda</a> (carried out in the context of the protracted <a href="Cabinda%20Conflict">Cabinda Conflict</a> by the <a href="Frente%20para%20a%20Liberta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20do%20Enclave%20de%20Cabinda">Frente para a Liberta√ß√£o do Enclave de Cabinda</a>, (FLEC)), but most of all, by the depredation of the country's rich mineral resources by the r√©gime. While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital, in the so-called "<a href="wikt%3Amusseque">musseque</a>s", the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.

<a href="Drought">Drought</a> in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a> in 25 years. Drought affected 1.4 million people across seven of Angola's 18 provinces. Food prices rose and acute <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a> rates doubled, with more than 95,000 children affected. <a href="Food%20insecurity">Food insecurity</a> was expected to worsen from July to December 2016.

At , Angola is the world's twenty-third largest country. It is comparable in size to Mali, or twice the size of France or Texas. It lies mostly between latitudes <a href="4th%20parallel%20south">4¬∞</a> and <a href="18th%20parallel%20south">18¬∞S</a>, and longitudes <a href="12th%20meridian%20east">12¬∞</a> and <a href="24th%20meridian%20east">24¬∞E</a>.

Angola is bordered by <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> to the south, <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> to the east, the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> to the north-east and the <a href="South%20Atlantic%20Ocean">South Atlantic Ocean</a> to the west. The coastal <a href="exclave">exclave</a> of <a href="Cabinda%20%28province%29">Cabinda</a> in the north, borders the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> to the north, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south. Angola's capital, <a href="Luanda">Luanda</a>, lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country.

Angola, although located in a <a href="tropical%20zone">tropical zone</a>, has a climate that is not characterized for this region, due to the confluence of three factors:


As a result, Angola's climate is characterized by two seasons: rainfall from October to April and drought, known as "Cacimbo", from May to August, drier, as the name implies, and with lower temperatures. On the other hand, while the coastline has high rainfall rates, decreasing from North to South and from 800¬†mm to 50¬†mm, with average annual temperatures above 23¬†¬∞C, the interior zone can be divided into three areas:


 
The Angolan government is composed of three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch comprises a 220-seat <a href="Unicameralism">unicameral</a> legislature elected from both provincial and nationwide constituencies. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the presidency.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Angola">Constitution of 2010</a> establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese law and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court does not hold the powers of judicial review. Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president.

After the end of the civil war the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international community to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to implement a number of changes without substantially changing its character.

Angola is classified as 'not free' by <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a> in the <a href="Freedom%20in%20the%20World">Freedom in the World</a> 2014 report. The report noted that the <a href="Angolan%20legislative%20election%2C%202012">August 2012 parliamentary elections</a>, in which the ruling <a href="Popular%20Movement%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Angola">Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola</a> won more than 70% of the vote, suffered from serious flaws, including outdated and inaccurate voter rolls. Voter turnout dropped from 80% in 2008 to 60%.

Angola scored poorly on the 2013 <a href="Ibrahim%20Index%20of%20African%20Governance">Ibrahim Index of African Governance</a>. It was ranked 39 out of 52 <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>n countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of participation and human rights, sustainable economic opportunity and human development. The Ibrahim Index uses a number of variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.
The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Angola">new constitution</a>, adopted in 2010, did away with presidential elections, introducing a system in which the president and the vice-president of the political party that wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vice-president. Directly or indirectly, the president controls all other organs of the state, so there is de facto no separation of powers. In terms of the classifications used in constitutional law, this form of government fall under the category of "authoritarian regime".

On 16 October 2014, Angola was elected for the second time as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, with 190 favourable votes out of 193. The mandate begins on 1 January 2015 and lasts for two years.

Also in that month, the country took on the leadership of the Group of African Ministers and Governors at the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> and the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>, following the debates at the annual meetings of both entities.

Since January 2014 the Republic of Angola has held the presidency of the <a href="International%20Conference%20on%20the%20Great%20Lakes%20Region">International Conference on the Great Lakes Region</a> (ICGLR). In 2015, the executive secretary of ICGLR, <a href="Ntumba%20Luaba">Ntumba Luaba</a>, said that Angola is the example to be followed by members of the organisation, because of the significant progress made over the 12 years of peace, particularly in terms of socioeconomic and political-military stability.

After 38 years of rule, President dos Santos will be stepping down from the MPLA leadership. The leader of the winning party at the Parliamentary Elections in August 2017 will become the next president of Angola. The MPLA has selected Defense Minister, General Jo√£o Louren√ßo, for their front-runner to take over from President dos Santos if the ruling party wins the August elections.

The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defence. There are three divisions‚Äîthe Army (Ex√©rcito), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA) and <a href="National%20Air%20Force%20of%20Angola">National Air Force</a> (For√ßa A√©rea Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is about 110,000. Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters, bombers and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made <a href="EMB-312%20Tucano">EMB-312 Tucano</a> for training role, Czech-made L-39 for training and bombing role, Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (Kinshasa) and the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> (Brazzaville).

The National Police departments are Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing, which will provide helicopter support for operations. The National Police are developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The force has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 taxation and frontier supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 economic activity inspectors.

The National Police have implemented a modernisation and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganisation, modernisation projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programmes and the replacement of <a href="AKM%20rifle">AKM rifle</a>s with 9¬†mm <a href="Uzi">Uzi</a>s for officers in urban areas.

A Supreme Court serves as a court of appeal. The Constitutional Court is the supreme body of the constitutional jurisdiction, its Organic Law was approved by Law no. 2/08, of June 17, and its first task was the validation of the candidacies of the political parties to the legislative elections of 5 September 2008. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary laws, but it is weak and fragmented. There are only 12 courts in more than 140 counties in the country. A Supreme Court serves as a court of appeal. With the approval of Law no. 2/08, of June 17 - Organic Law of the Constitutional Court and Law n. 3/08, of June 17 - Organic Law of the Constitutional Process, the Legal Creation of the Constitutional Court. Thus, on June 25, 2008, the Constitutional Court was institutionalized and its Judicial Counselors assumed the position before the President of the Republic. On this date, seven advisory judges took office, four men and three women.

In 2014, a new penal code took effect in Angola. The classification of money-laundering as a crime is one of the novelties in the new legislation.

On 16 October 2014, Angola was elected for the second time a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, with 190 favorable votes out of a total of 193. The term of office begins on 1 January 2015 and lasts for two Years.

Since January 2014, the Republic of Angola has been chairing the International Conference for the Great Lakes Region (CIRGL). [80] In 2015, CIRGL Executive Secretary Ntumba Luaba said that Angola is the example to be followed by the members of the organization, due to the significant progress made during the 12 years of peace, namely in terms of socio-economic stability and political- military.

<a href="Homosexuality">Homosexual</a> acts are currently illegal in Angola. However, in February 2017, the Angolan Parliament approved a new penal code which does not outlaw homosexual acts. The law will come effect in late 2017. In 2010, the Angolan Government refused to receive openly gay Isi Yanouka as the new Israeli ambassador, allegedly due to his <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a>.

, Angola is divided into <a href="Provinces%20of%20Angola">eighteen provinces</a> ("prov√≠ncias") and <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Angola">162 municipalities</a>. The municipalities are further divided into 559 communes (townships). The provinces are:

With an area of approximately , the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unusual in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some wide, of the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> along the lower <a href="Congo%20River">Congo River</a>. Cabinda borders the <a href="Congo%20Republic">Congo Republic</a> to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population centre.

According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighbouring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, "the Kuwait of Africa". Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output. Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under <a href="Portuguese%20Angola">Portuguese rule</a> by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.

Ever since <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the <a href="Government%20of%20Angola">Government of Angola</a> (which has employed its armed forces, the FAA‚ÄîFor√ßas Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The <a href="Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20the%20Enclave%20of%20Cabinda">Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda</a>-<a href="For%C3%A7as%20Armadas%20de%20Cabinda">Armed Forces of Cabinda</a> (FLEC-FAC) announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions.

Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold, copper and a rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest and fossils. Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource. Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">Angolan Civil War</a>, but have begun to recover after 2002. The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but has begun to reemerge with updated technologies, partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs. Similar developments can be verified in the service sector.

Overall, Angola's economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by a quarter-century of civil war to become the fastest-growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007. In the period 2001‚Äì10, Angola had the world's highest <a href="annual%20average%20GDP%20growth">annual average GDP growth</a>, at 11.1 percent. In 2004, the <a href="Exim%20Bank%20of%20China">Exim Bank of China</a> approved a $2¬†billion line of credit to Angola. The loan was to be used to rebuild Angola's infrastructure, and also to limited the influence of the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> in the country. China is Angola's biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the fourth-largest importer. Bilateral trade reached $27.67¬†billion in 2011, up 11.5% year-on-year. China's imports, mainly crude oil and diamonds, increased 9.1% to $24.89¬†billion while China's exports, including mechanical and electrical products, machinery parts and construction materials, surged 38.8%. The oil glut led to a local unleaded gasoline "pricetag" of <a href="Pound%20sterling">¬£</a>0.37 per gallon.

"<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60% of Angola's economy, almost all of the country's revenue and all its dominant exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising <a href="Extraction%20of%20petroleum">oil production</a> which surpassed in late 2005 and was expected to grow to by 2007. Control of the <a href="Petroleum%20industry">oil industry</a> is consolidated in <a href="Sonangol%20Group">Sonangol Group</a>, a conglomerate owned by the Angolan government. In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of <a href="OPEC">OPEC</a>. However, operations in <a href="List%20of%20diamond%20mines">diamond mines</a> include partnerships between state-run <a href="Endiama">Endiama</a> and mining companies such as <a href="ALROSA">ALROSA</a> which continue operations in Angola. The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007. However, due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated ‚àí0.3% in 2009. The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4¬†million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.

Although the country's economy has developed significantly since it achieved political stability in 2002, mainly thanks to the fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">civil war</a>. However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of "neo-patrimonial" practices at all levels of the political, administrative, armed forces and economic apparatuses, and of <a href="Corruption%20in%20Angola">a pervasive corruption</a>. The main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted during the last decades, around the political, administrative, economic and military power holders, which has accumulated (and continues accumulating) enormous wealth. "Secondary beneficiaries" are the middle strata which are about to become social classes. However, overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor, but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live).

An inquiry carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica has it that in the rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as "poor", according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, while the overall rate is 37%. In the cities, a majority of families, well beyond those officially classified as poor, have to adopt a variety of survival strategies. At the same time, in urban areas social inequality is most evident and assumes extreme forms in the capital, Luanda. In the <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a> Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group.

According to <a href="the%20Heritage%20Foundation">the Heritage Foundation</a>, a conservative American <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a>, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China's biggest supplier of oil. ‚ÄúChina has extended three multibillion dollar lines of credit to the Angolan government; two loans of $2 billion from China Exim Bank, one in 2004, the second in 2007, as well as one loan in 2005 of $2.9 billion from <a href="China%20International%20Fund">China International Fund</a> Ltd.‚Äù Growing oil revenues have also created opportunities for <a href="Corruption%20in%20Angola">corruption</a>: according to a recent <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> report, 32¬†billion US dollars disappeared from government accounts from 2007 to 2010. Furthermore, Sonangol, the state run oil company, has control of 51% of Cabinda‚Äôs oil. Due to this market control the company ends up determining the profit given to the government and the taxes paid. The council of foreign affairs states that the World Bank mentioned that Sonangol " is a taxpayer, it carries out quasi-fiscal activities, it invests public funds, and, as concessionaire, it is a sector regulator. This multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between Sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state."

Before independence in 1975, <a href="Angola%20%28Portugal%29">Angola</a> was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of <a href="banana">banana</a>s, coffee and <a href="sisal">sisal</a>, but <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">three decades of civil war</a> (1975‚Äì2002) destroyed fertile countryside, left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from South Africa and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, while more than 90% of farming is done at the family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.

The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the Angolan economy, illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in Luanda and neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression.

One of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad. The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets, for reasons of security and profit. For the time being, the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the <a href="Angolans%20in%20Portugal">Angolan presence</a> (including that of the family of the state president) in banks as well as in the domains of energy, <a href="Telecommunications%20in%20Angola">telecommunications</a>, and mass media has become notable, as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises.

<a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> nations are globally achieving impressive improvements in well-being, according to a report by <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> Africa Governance Initiative and <a href="the%20Boston%20Consulting%20Group">the Boston Consulting Group</a>. Angola has upgraded critical infrastructure, an investment made possible by funds from the nation's development of oil resources. According to this report, just slightly more than ten years after the end of the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> Angola's standard of living has overall greatly improved. Life expectancy, which was just 46 years in 2002, reached 51 in 2011. Mortality rates for children fell from 25 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001. However, at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country since long has not diminished, but on the contrary deepened in all respects.

With a stock of assets corresponding to 70¬†billion Kz (6.8¬†billion USD), Angola is now the third largest financial market in sub-Saharan Africa, surpassed only by <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and South Africa. According to the Angolan Minister of Economy, Abra√£o Gourgel, the financial market of the country grew modestly from 2002 and now lies in third place at the level of sub-Saharan Africa.

Angola's economy is expected to grow by 3.9 percent in 2014 said the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF). According to the Fund, robust growth in the non-oil economy, mainly driven by a very good performance in the agricultural sector, is expected to offset a temporary drop in oil production.

Angola's financial system is maintained by the <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20Angola">National Bank of Angola</a> and managed by governor . According to a study on the banking sector, carried out by <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a>, the monetary policy led by <a href="Banco%20Nacional%20de%20Angola">Banco Nacional de Angola</a> (BNA), the Angolan national bank, allowed a decrease in the inflation rate put at 7.96% in December 2013, which contributed to the sector's growth trend. According to estimates released by Angola's central bank, the country's economy should grow at an annual average rate of 5 percent over the next four years, boosted by the increasing participation of the private sector.

On 19 December 2014, the Capital Market in Angola started. <a href="Angola%20Stock%20Exchange">BODIVA</a> (Angola Securities and Debt Stock Exchange, in English) received the secondary public debt market, and it is expected to start the corporate debt market by 2015, but the stock market should be a reality only in 2016.

Agriculture and forestry is an area of opportunity for the country. ‚ÄúAngola requires 4.5 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55% of the corn it needs, 20% of the rice and just 5% of its required wheat‚Äù(African economic Outlook) but ‚Äúless than 3 percent of Angola's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited‚Äù (World Bank). From this fact we can appreciate the capacity that Angola has to increase production for not only for the national market but also the international one. Investing in this sector can help reduce unemployment and more specifically in the rural areas. This will undoubtedly have consequences on the living standard of rural civilians.

Transport in Angola consists of:

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made.

Transport is an important aspect in Angola because it is strategically located and it could become a regional logistics hub. In addition Angola has some of the most important and biggest ports and so it is vital to connect them to the interior of the country as well as to neighbouring countries.

Tourism is creaking to its feet on the heels of the long ended stop in the civil war, and very few tourists venture anywhere in Angola yet due to lack of infrastructure.

The <a href="telecommunication">telecommunication</a>s industry is considered one of the main strategic sectors in Angola.

In October 2014, the building of an <a href="optic%20fiber">optic fiber</a> underwater cable was announced. This project aims to turn Angola into a continental hub, thus improving Internet connections both nationally and internationally.

On 11 March 2015, the First Angolan Forum of Telecommunications and Information Technology was held in <a href="Luanda">Luanda</a> under the motto "The challenges of telecommunications in the current context of Angola". The purpose of this forum was to promote the debate on topical issues on telecommunications in Angola and worldwide. A study about this sector was also presented at this forum, and some of its conclusions were: Angola had the first telecommunications operator in Africa to test the High Speed Internet technology (LTE-Advanced with speeds up to 400Mbit/s); It has a mobile penetration rate of about 75%; There are about 3.5 million smartphones in the Angolan market; There are about of optical fibre installed in the country.

The first Angolan satellite, <a href="Angosat%201">AngoSat-1</a>, will be ready for launch into orbit in 2017 and it will ensure telecommunications throughout the country. According to Aristides Safeca, Secretary of State for Telecommunications, the satellite will provide telecommunications services, TV, internet and <a href="e-government">e-government</a> and will remain into orbit "at best" for 18 years.

The management of the domain '.ao' on web pages, will go from <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> to Angola in 2015, following the approval of a new legislation by the Angolan Government. The joint decree of the minister of Telecommunications and Information Technologies, Jos√© Carvalho da Rocha, and the minister of Science and Technology, Maria C√¢ndida Pereira Teixeira, states that "under the massification" of that Angolan domain, "conditions are created for the transfer of the domain root '.ao' of Portugal to Angola".

Angola has a population of 24,383,301 inhabitants according to the preliminary results of its 2014 census, the first one conducted or carried out since 15 December 1970. It is composed of <a href="Ovimbundu">Ovimbundu</a> (language <a href="Umbundu">Umbundu</a>) 37%, <a href="Northern%20Mbundu%20people">Ambundu</a> (language <a href="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a>) 23%, <a href="Bakongo">Bakongo</a> 13%, and 32% other ethnic groups (including the <a href="Chokwe%20people">Chokwe</a>, the <a href="Ovambo%20people">Ovambo</a>, the <a href="Ganguela">Ganguela</a> and the <a href="Xindonga">Xindonga</a>) as well as about 2% "<a href="mesti%C3%A7o">mesti√ßo</a>s" (mixed European and African), 1.6% Chinese and 1% European. The Ambundu and Ovimbundu ethnic groups combined form a majority of the population, at 62%. The population is forecast to grow to over 60 million people to 2050, 2.7 times the 2014 population. However, on 23 March 2016, official data revealed by Angola's National Statistic Institute ‚Äì Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), states that Angola has a population of 25.789.024 inhabitants.

It is estimated that Angola was host to 12,100 refugees and 2,900 asylum seekers by the end of 2007. 11,400 of those refugees were originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who arrived in the 1970s. there were an estimated 400,000 <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> migrant workers, at least 220,000 <a href="Portuguese%20Angolans">Portuguese</a>, and about 259,000 <a href="Chinese%20people%20in%20Angola">Chinese living in Angola</a>.

Since 2003, more than 400,000 <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Congolese</a> migrants have been expelled from Angola. Prior to independence in 1975, Angola had a community of approximately 350,000 Portuguese, but the vast majority left after independence and the ensuing civil war. However, Angola has recovered its Portuguese minority in recent years; currently, there are about 200,000 registered with the consulates, and increasing due to the debt crisis in Portugal and the relative prosperity in Angola. The Chinese population stands at 258,920, mostly composed of temporary migrants. Also, there is a small <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian community of about 5,000 people.

The <a href="total%20fertility%20rate">total fertility rate</a> of Angola is 5.54 children born per woman (2012 estimates), the 11th highest in the world.

The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups and <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, introduced during the Portuguese colonial era. The most widely spoken indigenous languages are <a href="Umbundu">Umbundu</a>, <a href="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a> and <a href="Kikongo">Kikongo</a>, in that order. Portuguese is the official language of the country.

Although the exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, a 2012 study mentions that Portuguese is the first language of 39% of the population. In 2014, a census carried out by the Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in Angola mentions that 71.15% of the nearly 25.8 million inhabitants of Angola (meaning around 18.3 million people) use Portuguese as a first or second language.

There are about 1,000 religious communities, mostly Christian, in Angola. While reliable statistics are nonexistent, estimates have it that more than half of the population are Catholics, while about a quarter adhere to the Protestant churches introduced during the colonial period: the <a href="Congregationalist">Congregationalist</a>s mainly among the <a href="Ovimbundu">Ovimbundu</a> of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its west, the <a href="Methodists">Methodists</a> concentrating on the <a href="Kimbundu">Kimbundu</a> speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje, the <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a> almost exclusively among the <a href="Bakongo">Bakongo</a> of the north-west (now present in Luanda as well) and dispersed <a href="Adventists">Adventists</a>, <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a> and <a href="Lutherans">Lutherans</a>. In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the "<a href="syncretic">syncretic</a>" <a href="Tocoists">Tocoists</a> and in the north-west a sprinkling of <a href="Kimbanguism">Kimbanguism</a> can be found, spreading from the Congo/Za√Øre. Since independence, hundreds of <a href="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> and similar communities have sprung up in the cities, where by now about 50% of the population is living; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin.

In a study assessing nations' levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 0 to 10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution, Angola was scored 0.8 on Government Regulation of Religion, 4.0 on Social Regulation of Religion, 0 on Government Favoritism of Religion and 0 on Religious Persecution.

Foreign <a href="Missionary">missionaries</a> were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments. Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s, although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations.

The Catholic Church and some major Protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the "New Churches" which actively proselytize. Catholics, as well as some major Protestant denominations, provide help for the poor in the form of crop seeds, farm animals, medical care and education.

The "<a href="Substratum">substrate</a>" of Angolan culture is African, predominantly <a href="Bantu%20people">Bantu</a>, while <a href="culture%20of%20Portugal">Portuguese culture</a> has had a significant impact, specifically in terms of language and religion. The diverse ethnic communities ‚Äì the <a href="Ovimbundu">Ovimbundu</a>, <a href="Northern%20Mbundu%20people">Ambundu</a>, <a href="Bakongo">Bakongo</a>, <a href="Chokwe%20people">Chokwe</a>, <a href="Mbunda%20people">Mbunda</a> and other peoples ‚Äì to varying degrees maintain their own cultural traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where slightly more than half of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times; in <a href="Luanda">Luanda</a>, since its foundation in the 16th century. In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. African roots are evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of <a href="Angolan%20literature">Angolan authors</a>.

In 2014, Angola resumed the National Festival of Angolan Culture after a 25-year break. The festival took place in all the provincial capitals and lasted for 20 days, with the theme "Culture as a Factor of Peace and Development".

Epidemics of <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="rabies">rabies</a> and African <a href="hemorrhagic">hemorrhagic</a> fevers like <a href="Marburg%20virus">Marburg hemorrhagic fever</a>, are common diseases in several parts of the country. Many regions in this country have high incidence rates of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and high <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20Africa">HIV prevalence</a> rates. <a href="Dengue">Dengue</a>, <a href="filariasis">filariasis</a>, <a href="leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a> and <a href="onchocerciasis">onchocerciasis</a> (river blindness) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region. Angola has one of the highest <a href="infant%20mortality%20rate">infant mortality rate</a>s in the world and one of the world's lowest <a href="life%20expectancies">life expectancies</a>. A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient <a href="niacin">niacin</a> status was common in Angola. <a href="Demographic%20and%20Health%20Surveys">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on malaria, domestic violence and more.

In September 2014, the Angolan Institute for Cancer Control (IACC) was created by presidential decree, and it will integrate the National Health Service in Angola. The purpose of this new centre is to ensure the health and medical care in <a href="oncology">oncology</a>, policy implementation, programmes and plans for prevention and specialised treatment. This cancer institute will be assumed as a reference institution in the central and southern regions of Africa.

In 2014, Angola launched a national campaign of <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a> against <a href="measles">measles</a>, extended to every child under ten years old and aiming to go to all 18 provinces in the country. The measure is part of the Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Measles 2014‚Äì2020 created by the Angolan Ministry of Health which includes strengthening routine immunisation, a proper dealing with measles cases, national campaigns, introducing a second dose of vaccination in the national routine vaccination calendar and active epidemiological surveillance for measles. This campaign took place together with the vaccination against <a href="polio">polio</a> and <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a> supplementation.

A <a href="2016%20Angola%20and%20DR%20Congo%20yellow%20fever%20outbreak">yellow fever</a> outbreak, the worst in the country in three decades began in December 2015. By August 2016, when the outbreak began to subside, nearly 4,000 people were suspected of being infected. As many as 369 may have died. The outbreak began in the capital, Luanda, and spread to at least 16 of the 18 provinces.

Although by law education in Angola is compulsory and free for eight years, the government reports that a percentage of pupils are not attending due to a lack of school buildings and teachers. Pupils are often responsible for paying additional school-related expenses, including fees for books and supplies.

In 1999, the gross primary enrollment rate was 74 percent and in 1998, the most recent year for which data are available, the net primary enrollment rate was 61 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of pupils formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. There continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas. In 1995, 71.2 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school. It is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls. During the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">Angolan Civil War</a> (1975‚Äì2002), nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed, leading to current problems with overcrowding.

The Ministry of Education recruited 20,000 new teachers in 2005 and continued to implement teacher trainings. Teachers tend to be underpaid, inadequately trained and overworked (sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day). Some teachers may reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their pupils. Other factors, such as the presence of landmines, lack of resources and identity papers, and poor health prevent children from regularly attending school. Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004, the education system in Angola continues to be extremely under-funded.

According to estimates by the <a href="UNESCO%20Institute%20for%20Statistics">UNESCO Institute for Statistics</a>, the adult literacy rate in 2011 was 70.4%. 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001. Since independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools, <a href="politechnic">polytechnical</a> institutes and universities in <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, Brazil and <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> through bilateral agreements; in general, these students belong to the elites.

In September 2014, the Angolan Ministry of Education announced an investment of 16 million Euros in the computerisation of over 300 classrooms across the country. The project also includes training teachers at a national level, "as a way to introduce and use new information technologies in primary schools, thus reflecting an improvement in the quality of teaching."

In 2010, the Angolan government started building the Angolan Media Libraries Network, distributed throughout several provinces in the country to facilitate the people's access to information and knowledge. Each site has a bibliographic archive, multimedia resources and computers with Internet access, as well as areas for reading, researching and socialising. The plan envisages the establishment of one media library in each Angolan province by 2017. The project also includes the implementation of several media libraries, in order to provide the several contents available in the fixed media libraries to the most isolated populations in the country. At this time, the mobile media libraries are already operating in the provinces of Luanda, Malanje, U√≠ge, Cabinda and Lunda South. As for REMA, the provinces of Luanda, Benguela, Lubango and Soyo have currently working media libraries.

Angola hosted the <a href="2010%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations">2010 Africa Cup of Nations</a>.
Angola is the top <a href="Angola%20national%20basketball%20team">basketball team</a> of <a href="FIBA%20Africa">FIBA Africa</a>, and a regular competitor at the <a href="Basketball%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Summer Olympic Games</a> and the <a href="FIBA%20World%20Cup">FIBA World Cup</a>. The <a href="Angola%20national%20football%20team">Angola national football team</a> qualified for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, as this was their first appearance on the World Cup finals stage. They were eliminated after one defeat and two draws in the group stage. They won 3 <a href="COSAFA%20Cup">COSAFA Cup</a>s and finished runner up in <a href="2011%20African%20Nations%20Championship">2011 African Nations Championship</a>. Angola has participated in the <a href="World%20Women%27s%20Handball%20Championship">World Women's Handball Championship</a> for several years. The country has also appeared in the <a href="Angola%20at%20the%20Olympics">Summer Olympics</a> for seven years and both regularly competes in and once has hosted the <a href="FIRS%20Roller%20Hockey%20World%20Cup">FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup</a>, where the best finish is sixth.

Demographics of Angola

This article is about the <a href="demographics">demographic</a> features of the <a href="population">population</a> of <a href="Angola">Angola</a>, including <a href="population%20density">population density</a>, <a href="Ethnic%20group">ethnicity</a>, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
According to 2014 census data, Angola had a population of 25,789,024 inhabitants in 2014.
Ethnically, there are three main groups, each speaking a <a href="Bantu%20language">Bantu language</a>: the <a href="Southern%20Mbundu%20people">Ovimbundu</a> who represent 37% of the population, the <a href="Northern%20Mbundu%20people">Ambundu</a> with 25%, and the <a href="Kongo%20people">Bakongo</a> 13%. Other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated <a href="Chokwe%20people">Chokwe</a> and <a href="Lunda%20people">Lunda</a>, the <a href="Ganguela">Ganguela</a> and <a href="Nyaneka">Nyaneka</a>-<a href="Khumbi">Khumbi</a> (in both cases classification terms that stand for a variety of small groups), the <a href="Ovambo%20people">Ovambo</a>, the <a href="Herero%20people">Herero</a>, the <a href="Xindonga">Xindonga</a> and scattered residual groups of <a href="San%20people">San</a>. In addition, mixed race (European and African) people amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a>.

As a <a href="Angola%20%28Portugal%29">former overseas territory of Portugal</a> until 1975, Angola possesses a Portuguese population of over 200,000, a number that has been growing from 2000 onwards, because of Angola's growing demand for qualified human resources. Besides the Portuguese, significant numbers of people from other European and from diverse Latin American countries (especially Brazil) can be found. From the 2000s, many Chinese have settled and started up small businesses, while at least as many have come as workers for large enterprises (construction or other). Observers claim that the Chinese community in Angola might include as many as 300,000 persons at the end of 2010, but reliable statistics are not at this stage available. In 1974/75, over 25,000 <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>n soldiers arrived in Angola to help the MPLA forces at the beginning of the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">Angolan Civil War</a>. Once this was over, a massive development cooperation in the field of health and education brought in numerous civil personnel from Cuba. However, only a very small percentage of all these people has remained in Angola, either for personal reasons (intermarriage) or as professionals (e.g., medical doctors).

The largest religious denomination is <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholicism</a>, to which adheres about half the population. Roughly 26% are followers of traditional forms of <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> (Congregationals, Methodists, Baptista, Lutherans, Reformed), but over the last decades there has in addition been a growth of Pentecostal communities and <a href="African%20Initiated%20Church">African Initiated Church</a>es. In 2006, one out of 221 people were <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>. Blacks from Mali, Nigeria and Senegal are mostly Sunnite Muslims, but do not make up more than 1 - 2% of the population. By now few Angolans retain <a href="African%20traditional%20religion">African traditional religion</a>s following different ethnic faiths.

According to the total population was in , compared to only 4 148 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 46.6%, 50.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.5% was 65 years or older

Structure of the population (DHS 2011) (Males 19 707, Females 20 356 = 40 063) :

Registration of vital events is in Angola not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.

Total Fertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted TFR) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR):

The following demographic statistics are from the <a href="CIA%20World%20Factbook">CIA World Factbook</a>, unless otherwise indicated.


The population is growing by 2.184% annually. There are 44.51 births and 24.81 deaths per 1,000 citizens. The net migration rate is 2.14 migrants per 1,000 citizens. The fertility rate of Angola is 5.97 children born per woman as of 2011. The <a href="infant%20mortality">infant mortality</a> rate is 184.44 deaths for every 1,000 live births with 196.55 deaths for males and 171.72 deaths for females for every 1,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth is 37.63 years; 36.73 years for males and 38.57 years for females.


According to the CIA World Factbook, 2% of adults (aged 15‚Äì49) are living with HIV/AIDS (as of 2009). The risk of contracting disease is very high. There are food and waterborne diseases, bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever; vectorborne diseases, malaria, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness); respiratory disease: meningococcal meningitis, and schistosomiasis, a water contact disease, as of 2005.

Roughly 37% of Angolans are <a href="Ovimbundu">Ovimbundu</a>, 25% are <a href="Northern%20Mbundu%20people">Ambundu</a>, 13% are <a href="Bakongo">Bakongo</a>, 2% are <a href="mesti%C3%A7o">mesti√ßo</a>, 1-2% are <a href="White%20Africans%20of%20European%20ancestry">white Africans</a>, and people from other African ethnicities make up 22% of Angola's population.

Angola is a majority Christian country. Official statistics don't exist, but it is estimated that over 80% belong to a Christian church or community. More than half are <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>, the remaining ones comprising members of traditional <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> churches as well as of <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> communities. Only 1 - 2% are <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s - generally immigrants from other African countries. Traditional indigenous religions are practized by a very small minority, generally in peripheral rural societies.

Literacy is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese. 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001.

<a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> is the official language of Angola, but <a href="Bantu%20language">Bantu</a> and other African languages are also widely spoken. In fact, <a href="Kikongo">Kikongo</a>, <a href="Kimbundu%20languages">Kimbundu</a>, <a href="Umbundu">Umbundu</a>, <a href="Chokwe%20language">Tuchokwe</a>, <a href="Ganguela">Nganguela</a>, and <a href="Kwanyama%20dialect">Ukanyama</a> have the official status of "national languages". The mastery of Portuguese is widespread; in the cities the overwhelming majority are either fluent in Portuguese or have at least a reasonable working knowledge of this language; an increasing minority are native Portuguese speakers and have a poor, if any, knowledge of an African language.

Politics of Angola

Since the adoption of a new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Angola%232010%20constitution">constitution in 2010</a>, the politics of Angola takes place in a framework of a <a href="presidential%20system">presidential</a> <a href="republic">republic</a>, whereby the <a href="President%20of%20Angola">President of Angola</a> is both <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>, and of a <a href="multi-party%20system">multi-party system</a>. <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the government. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in the President, the <a href="Forms%20of%20government">government</a> and parliament.

<a href="Angola">Angola</a> changed from a <a href="One-party%20state">one-party</a> <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a>-<a href="Leninist">Leninist</a> system ruled by the <a href="Popular%20Movement%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Angola">Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola</a> (MPLA), in place since independence in 1975, to a multiparty democracy based on a new constitution adopted in 1992. That same year the first parliamentary and presidential elections were held. The MPLA won an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections. In the presidential elections, President <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Eduardo%20dos%20Santos">Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos</a> won the first round election with more than 49% of the vote to <a href="Jonas%20Savimbi">Jonas Savimbi</a>'s 40%. A runoff election would have been necessary, but never took place. The renewal of civil war immediately after the elections, which were considered as fraudulent by UNITA, and the collapse of the <a href="Lusaka%20Protocol">Lusaka Protocol</a>, created a split situation. To a certain degree the new democratic institutions worked, notably the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Angola">National Assembly</a>, with the active participation of UNITA's and the FNLA's elected MPs - while Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos continued to exercise his functions without democratic legitimation. However the armed forces of the MPLA (now the official armed forces of the Angolan state) and of UNITA fought each other until the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, was killed in action in 2002.

From 2002 to 2010, the system as defined by the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Angola%231992%20constitution">constitution of 1992</a> functioned in a relatively normal way. The executive branch of the government was composed of the President, the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, composed of all ministers and vice ministers, met regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 established the broad outlines of government structure and the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system was based on Portuguese and customary law but was weak and fragmented. Courts operated in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court served as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review was never constituted despite statutory authorization. In practice, power was more and more concentrated in the hands of the President who, supported by an ever-increasing staff, largely controlled parliament, government, and the judiciary.

The 26-year-long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million <a href="internally%20displaced%20person">internally displaced person</a>s (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically <a href="Luanda">Luanda</a> (population approximately 6 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.

The 2010 constitution grants the President almost absolute power. Elections for the National assembly are to take place every five years, and the President is automatically the leader of the winning party or coalition. It is for the President to appoint (and dismiss) all of the following:
The President is also provided a variety of powers, like defining the policy of the country. Even though it's not up to him/her to make laws (only to promulgate them and make edicts), the President is the leader of the winning party.
The only "relevant" post that is not directly appointed by the President is the Vice-President, which is the second in the winning party.

The <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Angola">National Assembly</a> ("Assembleia Nacional") has 223 members, elected for a four-year term, 130 members by <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a>, 90 members in provincial districts, and 3 members to represent Angolans abroad. The next general elections, due for 1997, have been rescheduled for 5 September 2008. The ruling party MPLA won 82% (191 seats in the National Assembly) and the main opposition party won only 10% (16 seats). The elections however have been described as only partly free but certainly not fair. A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists up all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.

Supreme Court (or "Tribunal da Relacao") judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the president. The Constitutional Court, with the power of judicial review, contains 11 justices. Four are appointed by the President, four by the National Assembly, two by the Superior Council of the Judiciary, and one elected by the public.

Economy of Angola

The Economy of Angola is one of the fastest-growing in the world, with reported annual average <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> growth of 11.1 percent from 2001 to 2010. It is still recovering from 27 years of the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> that plagued the country from its <a href="Alvor%20Agreement">independence in 1975</a> to 2002. Despite extensive <a href="Crude%20oil">oil and gas</a> resources, <a href="diamond">diamond</a>s, <a href="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> potential, and rich <a href="Agriculture">agricultural</a> land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the nation has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions. High international oil prices and rising oil production have contributed to the very strong economic growth since 1998, but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.

The <a href="Portuguese%20exploration%20of%20Africa">Portuguese explorer</a> <a href="Diogo%20C%C3%A3o">Diogo C√£o</a> reached the Angolan coast in 1484, after which <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a> began to found trading posts and forts along the shore. <a href="Paulo%20Dias%20de%20Novais">Paulo Dias de Novais</a> founded SƒÅo Paulo de Loanda (<a href="Luanda">Luanda</a>) in 1575. S√£o Felipe de Benguella (<a href="Benguela">Benguela</a>) followed in 1587.

The principal early trade was in <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">slaves</a>. Portuguese merchants purchased the slaves from the local <a href="Imbangala">Imbangala</a> and <a href="Northern%20Mbundu%20people">Mbundu</a> peoples, <a href="Slavery%20in%20Africa">notable slave hunters</a>, and sold them to the <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a> <a href="Sugar%20plantations%20in%20the%20Caribbean">plantation</a>s in <a href="Captaincies%20of%20Brazil">Brazil</a>. Brazilian ships were frequent visitors to Luanda and Benguela and Angola functioned as a kind of colony of Brazil, with Brazilian <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a> active in its religious and educational centers.

The <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a> was neglected during the period of the <a href="Iberian%20Union">Iberian Union</a>, which lasted from 1580 to 1640. The <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a>, bitter enemies of their former masters in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Spain">Spain</a>, invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions. During Portugal's separatist war against Spain, the Dutch occupied Luanda from 1640 to 1648, calling it "Fort Aardenburgh". The Dutch used the territory to supply their own slaves to the sugarcane plantations of <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Northeastern Brazil</a> (<a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a>, <a href="Olinda">Olinda</a>, <a href="Recife">Recife</a>), which they had also seized from Portugal. <a href="John%20Maurice%2C%20Prince%20of%20Nassau-Siegen">John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen</a>, conquered the Portuguese possessions of <a href="Elmina">Saint George del Mina</a>, Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. Portugal recovered the territory between 1648 and 1650.

In the high plains, the Planalto, the most important native states were <a href="Bi%C3%A9%20Province">Bi√©</a> and <a href="Bailundo">Bailundo</a>, the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. Portugal expanded into their territory, but did not control much of the interior prior to the late 19th century.

The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Following the <a href="independence%20of%20Brazil">independence of Brazil</a> in 1822, the slave trade was formally abolished in 1836. However it did continue locally into the 20th century. In 1844, Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping.

By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a> outside of <a href="Mainland%20Portugal">Mainland Portugal</a>, full of trading companies, exporting peanut oil, copal, timber, and cocoa. The principal exports of the post-slave economy in the 19th century were <a href="rubber">rubber</a>, beeswax, and ivory. Maize, tobacco, dried meat and <a href="cassava">cassava</a> flour also began to be locally produced. Prior to the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, exportation of <a href="coffee">coffee</a>, <a href="palm%20tree">palm</a> kernels and <a href="palm%20oil">oil</a>, <a href="cattle">cattle</a>, <a href="leather">leather</a> and <a href="Hide%20%28skin%29">hides</a>, and <a href="salt%20fish">salt fish</a> joined the principal exports, with small quantities of gold and <a href="cotton">cotton</a> also being produced. Grains, sugar, and rum were also produced for local consumption. The principal imports were foodstuffs, cotton goods, hardware, and British coal. Legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the 1890s. The territory's prosperity, however, continued to depend on plantations worked by labor "indentured" from the interior.

From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers. <a href="Petroleum">Petroleum</a> was known to exist as early as the mid-19th century, but modern exploitation didn't begin until in 1955. Production began in the <a href="Cuanza%20basin">Cuanza basin</a> in the 1950s, in the <a href="Congo%20basin">Congo basin</a> in the 1960s, and in the <a href="exclave">exclave</a> of <a href="Cabinda%20%28province%29">Cabinda</a> in 1968. The <a href="Portuguese%20government">Portuguese government</a> granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of <a href="ChevronTexaco">ChevronTexaco</a>, in 1955. Oil production surpassed the exportation of <a href="coffee">coffee</a> as Angola's largest export in 1973.

A military-led coup d'√©tat, started on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, overthrew the <a href="Marcelo%20Caetano">Marcelo Caetano</a> government in Portugal, and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government. <a href="Mobutu%20Sese%20Seko">Mobutu Sese Seko</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20Zaire">President of Zaire</a>, met with <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Sp%C3%ADnola">Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola</a>, the transitional <a href="President%20of%20Portugal">President of Portugal</a>, on September 15, 1974, on <a href="Sal%20island">Sal island</a> in <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>, crafting a plan to empower <a href="Holden%20Roberto">Holden Roberto</a> of the <a href="National%20Liberation%20Front%20of%20Angola">National Liberation Front of Angola</a>, <a href="Jonas%20Savimbi">Jonas Savimbi</a> of <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a>, and <a href="Daniel%20Chipenda">Daniel Chipenda</a> of the <a href="MPLA">MPLA</a>'s eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader <a href="Agostinho%20Neto">Agostinho Neto</a> while retaining the fa√ßade of national unity. Mobutu and Sp√≠nola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for <a href="Cabinda%20%28province%29">Cabinda</a>. The Angolan <a href="exclave">exclave</a> has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300¬†kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival. After independence thousands of white Portuguese left, most of them to <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> and many travelling overland to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.

The Angolan government created <a href="Sonangol">Sonangol</a>, a state-run oil company, in 1976. Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola. After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> between 1975 and 2002.

<a href="United%20Nations%20Angola%20Verification%20Mission%20III">United Nations Angola Verification Mission III</a> and <a href="MONUA">MONUA</a> spent <a href="USD">USD</a>1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the <a href="Lusaka%20Protocol">Lusaka Protocol</a>, a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war. The protocol prohibited <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a> from buying foreign arms, a provision the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in <a href="Albania">Albania</a> and <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, and from <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, <a href="Togo">Togo</a>, and <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 and 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, Bulgaria, <a href="China">China</a>, and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required.

Despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note.

An economic reform effort was launched in 1998. Angola ranked 160 of 174 nations in the <a href="United%20Nations%20Human%20Development%20Index">United Nations Human Development Index</a> in 2000. In April 2000 Angola started an <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> assistance, has begun with the <a href="Banco%20de%20Com%C3%A9rcio%20e%20Ind%C3%BAstria">BCI</a> bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists. The civil war <a href="Internally%20displaced%20person">internally displaced</a> 3.8 million people, 32% of the population, by 2001. The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> production.

Angola produced over of diamonds in 2003, and production was expected to grow to per year by 2007. In 2004 China's Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola to rebuild infrastructure. The economy grew 18% in 2005 and growth was expected to reach 26% in 2006 and stay above 10% for the rest of the decade.

The construction industry is taking advantage of the growing economy, with various housing projects stimulated by the government initiatives for example the "Angola Investe" program and the "<a href="Grupo%20Opaia%20SA%23Casa%20Feliz">Casa Feliz</a>" or "<a href="Grupo%20Opaia%20SA%23Opaia%20%C3%81guas%20%28Water%29">Me√±a</a>" projects. Not all public construction projects are functional. A case in point: <a href="Kilamba%20Kiaxi">Kilamba Kiaxi</a>, where a whole new satellite town of Luanda, consisting of housing facilities for several hundreds of thousands of people, was completely uninhabited for over four years because of skyrocketing prices, but completely sold out after the government decreased the original price and created mortgage plans at around the election time thus made it affordable for middle-class people. 
ChevronTexaco started pumping from Block 14 in January 2000, but production decreased to in 2007 due to poor-quality oil. Angola joined the <a href="Organization%20of%20the%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</a> on January 1, 2007.

Cabinda Gulf Oil Company found Malange-1, an oil reservoir in Block 14, on August 9, 2007.

Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in <a href="Sonangol%20Group">Sonangol Group</a>, a conglomerate owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs to build roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.

In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, have brought agricultural activities to a near-standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. <a href="Coffee">Coffee</a> production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. Expanding oil production is now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at . Diamonds provided much of the revenue for <a href="Jonas%20Savimbi">Jonas Savimbi</a>'s <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a> rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.

This is a chart of trend of <a href="Real%20versus%20nominal%20value%20%28economics%29">nominal</a> <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> of Angola at market prices using International Monetary Fund data; figures are in millions of units.
Exports in 2004 reached <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>10,530,764,911. The vast majority of Angola's exports, 92% in 2004, are petroleum products. US$785 million worth of diamonds, 7.5% of exports, were sold abroad that year. Nearly all of Angola's oil goes to the United States, in 2006, making it the eighth largest supplier of oil to the United States, and to <a href="China">China</a>, in 2006. In the first quarter of 2008, Angola became the main exporter of oil to China. The rest of its petroleum exports go to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. U.S. companies account for more than half the investment in Angola, with Chevron-Texaco leading the way. The U.S. exports industrial goods and services, primarily oilfield equipment, mining equipment, chemicals, aircraft, and food, to Angola, while principally importing petroleum. Trade between Angola and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> exceeded USD¬†300 million in 2007. From the 2000s many Chinese have settled and started up businesses.

Angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, surpassing <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> in the <a href="2000s%20in%20Angola">2000s</a>. In January 2007 Angola became a member of <a href="OPEC">OPEC</a>. By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields. Oil sales generated USD¬†1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the government's budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of <a href="GDP">GDP</a>.

<a href="Chevron%20Corporation">Chevron Corporation</a> produces and receives , 27% of Angolan oil. <a href="Total%20S.A.">Total S.A.</a>, <a href="Chevron%20Corporation">Chevron Corporation</a>, <a href="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a>, <a href="Eni">Eni</a>, <a href="Petrobras">Petrobras</a>, and <a href="BP">BP</a> also operate in the country.

Block Zero provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production with produced annually. The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B). Chevron operates in Block Zero with a 39.2% share. <a href="SONANGOL">SONANGOL</a>, the state oil company, Total, and Eni own the rest of the block. Chevron also operates Angola's first producing deepwater section, Block 14, with .

The <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> has criticized the Angolan government for using torture, rape, summary executions, arbitrary detention, and disappearances, actions which Angolan government has justified on the need to maintain oil output.

Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports. The U.S. imports 7% of its oil from Angola, about three times as much as it imported from <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> just prior to the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> in 1991. The U.S. Government has invested USD $4 billion in Angola's petroleum sector.

Oil makes up over 90% of Angola's exports.

Angola is the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa and has only explored 40% of the diamond-rich territory within the country, but has had difficulty in attracting foreign investment because of corruption, human rights violations, and diamond smuggling. Production rose by 30% in 2006 and <a href="Endiama">Endiama</a>, the national diamond company of Angola, expects production to increase by 8% in 2007 to 10 million carats annually. The government is trying to attract foreign companies to the <a href="Provinces%20of%20Angola">provinces</a> of <a href="Bi%C3%A9%20%28province%29">Bi√©</a>, <a href="Malanje%20%28province%29">Malanje</a> and <a href="U%C3%ADge%20Province">U√≠ge</a>.

The Angolan government loses $375 million annually from diamond smuggling. In 2003 the government began Operation Brilliant, an anti-smuggling investigation that arrested and deported 250,000 smugglers between 2003 and 2006. <a href="Rafael%20Marques%20%28journalist%29">Rafael Marques</a>, a journalist and human rights activist, described the diamond industry in his 2006 "Angola's Deadly Diamonds" report as plagued by "murders, beatings, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations." Marques called on foreign countries to boycott Angola's "<a href="conflict%20diamonds">conflict diamonds</a>". In December 2014, the <a href="Bureau%20of%20International%20Labor%20Affairs">Bureau of International Labor Affairs</a> issued a "<a href="List%20of%20Goods%20Produced%20by%20Child%20Labor%20or%20Forced%20Labor">List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</a>" that classified Angola as one of the major diamond-producing African countries relying on both child labor and forced labor. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor">U.S. Department of Labor</a> reported that "there is little publicly available information on [Angola's] efforts to enforce child labor law". Diamonds accounted for 1.48% of Angolan exports in 2014.

Under Portuguese rule, <a href="Angola%20%28Portugal%29">Angola</a> began mining <a href="iron">iron</a> in 1957, producing 1.2 million tons in 1967 and 6.2 million tons by 1971. In the early 1970s, 70% of Portuguese Angola's iron exports went to <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a> and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. After independence in 1975, the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">Angolan Civil War</a> (1975‚Äì2002) destroyed most of the territory's mining infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Angolan mining industry started in the late 2000s.

The FAA include the General Staff of the Armed Forces and three components: the Army ("Ex√©rcito"), the Navy ("Marinha de Guerra") and the National Air Force ("National Air Force"). Reported total manpower in 2013 was about 107,000.

The FAA is headed by Chief of the General Staff <a href="Geraldo%20Sachipengo%20Nunda">Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda</a> since 2010, who reports to the Minister of National Defense, currently Jo√£o Louren√ßo.

As part of the peace agreement, troops from both armies were to be <a href="demilitarized">demilitarized</a> and then integrated. Integration was never completed as UNITA and FALA went back to war in 1992. Later, consequences for FALA personnel in Luanda were harsh with FAPLA veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of <a href="vigilantism">vigilantism</a>.

The Army ("Ex√©rcito") is the land component of the FAA. It is organized in six military regions (Cabinda, Luanda, North, Center, East and South), with an infantry division being based in each one. Distributed by the six military regions / infantry divisions, there are 25 motorized infantry brigades, one tank brigade and one engineering brigade. The Army also includes an artillery regiment, the Military Artillery School, the Army Military Academy, an anti-aircraft defense group, a composite land artillery group, a military police regiment, a logistical transportation regiment and a field artillery brigade. The Army further includes the Special Forces Brigade (including Commandos and Special Operations units), but this unit is under the direct command of the General Staff of the FAA.

On August 1, 1974 a few months after a military <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'√©tat</a> had overthrown the <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> regime and proclaimed its intention of granting independence to Angola, the MPLA announced the formation of FAPLA, which replaced the EPLA. By 1976 FAPLA had been transformed from lightly armed guerrilla units into a national <a href="army">army</a> capable of sustained field operations.

In 1990-91, the Army had ten military regions and an estimated 73+ 'brigades', each with a mean strength of 1,000 and comprising inf, tank, APC, artillery, and AA units as required. The <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> said in 1990 that '[t]he regular army's 91,500 troops were organized into more than seventy brigades ranging from 750 to 1,200 men each and deployed throughout the ten military regions. Most regions were commanded by lieutenant colonels, with majors as deputy commanders, but some regions were commanded by majors. Each region consisted of one to four provinces, with one or more infantry brigades assigned to it. The brigades were generally dispersed in battalion or smaller unit formations to protect strategic terrain, urban centers, settlements, and critical infrastructure such as bridges and factories. Counterintelligence agents were assigned to all field units to thwart UNITA infiltration. The army's diverse combat capabilities were indicated by its many regular and motorised infantry brigades with organic or attached armor, artillery, and air defense units; two militia infantry brigades; four antiaircraft artillery brigades; ten tank battalions; and six artillery battalions. These forces were concentrated most heavily in places of strategic importance and recurring conflict: the oil-producing <a href="Cabinda%20Province">Cabinda Province</a>, the area around the capital, and the southern provinces where UNITA and South African forces operated.'

It was reported in 2011 that the army was by far the largest of the services with about 120,000 men and women. The Angolan Army has around 29,000 "ghost workers" who remain enrolled in the ranks of the FAA and therefore receive a salary.

In 2013, the <a href="International%20Institute%20for%20Strategic%20Studies">International Institute for Strategic Studies</a> reported that the FAA had six divisions, the 1st, 5th, and 6th with two or three infantry brigades, and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th with five to six infantry brigades. The 4th Division included a tank regiment. A separate tank brigade and special forces brigade were also reported.

As of 2011, the IISS reported the ground forces had 42 armoured/infantry regiments ('detachments/groups - strength varies') and 16 infantry '<a href="brigade">brigade</a>s'. These probably comprised <a href="infantry">infantry</a>, <a href="tank">tank</a>s, <a href="Armoured%20personnel%20carriers">APC</a>, <a href="artillery">artillery</a>, and <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">AA units</a> as required. Major equipment included over 140 <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>s, 600 <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> vehicles, over 920 <a href="armored%20fighting%20vehicles">AFV</a>s, <a href="infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">infantry fighting vehicle</a>s, 298 <a href="howitzers">howitzers</a>.

It was reported on May 3, 2007, that the Special Forces Brigade of the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) located at Cabo Ledo region, northern <a href="Bengo%20Province">Bengo Province</a>, would host a 29th anniversary celebration for the entire armed forces. The brigade was reportedly formed on 5 May 1978 and under the command at the time of Colonel Paulo Falcao.

The Army operates a large amount of Russian, Soviet and ex-Warsaw pact hardware. A large amount of its equipment was acquired in the 1980s and 1990s most likely because of hostilities with neighbouring countries and its <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> which lasted from November 1975 until 2002. There is an interest from the Angolan Army for the Brazilian <a href="Astros%20II%20MLRS">ASTROS II</a> multiple rocket launcher.

Many of Angola's weapons are of <a href="Portuguese%20Angola">Portuguese colonial</a> and <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> origin. <a href="Jane%27s%20Information%20Group">Jane's Information Group</a> lists the following as in service:






The <a href="National%20Air%20Force%20of%20Angola">National Air Force of Angola</a> (FANA, "For√ßa A√©rea Nacional de Angola") is the air component of the FAA. It is organized in six aviation regiments, each including several squadrons. To each of the regiments correspond an air base. Besides the aviation regiments, there is also a Pilot Training School.

The Air Force's personnel total about 8,000; its equipment includes transport aircraft and six <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n-manufactured <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-27">Sukhoi Su-27</a> <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>. In 2002 one was lost during the civil war with UNITA forces.

In 1991, the Air Force/Air Defense Forces had 8,000 personnel and 90 combat-capable aircraft, including 22 fighters, 59 fighter ground attack aircraft and 16 attack helicopters.

The Angola Navy (MGA, "Marinha de Guerra de Angola") is the naval component of the FAA. It is organized in two naval zones (North and South), with naval bases in Luanda, Lobito and Namibe. It includes a Marines Brigade and a Marines School, based in Ambriz. The Navy numbers about 1,000 personnel and operates only a handful of small patrol craft and barges.

The Navy has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the Portuguese and the nature of the civil war. From the early 1990s to the present the Angolan Navy has shrunk from around 4,200 personnel to around 1,000, resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment. In order to protect Angola‚Äôs 1 600¬†km long coastline, the Angolan Navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways. Portugal has been providing training through its Technical Military Cooperation (CTM) programme. The Navy is requesting procurement of a frigate, three corvettes, three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats.

Most of the vessels in the navy's inventory dates back from the 1980s or earlier, and many of its ships are inoperable due to age and lack of maintenance. However the navy acquired new boats from Spain and France in the 1990s. Germany has delivered several <a href="Fast%20Attack%20Craft">Fast Attack Craft</a> for border protection in 2011.

In September 2014 it was reported that the Angolan Navy would acquire seven <a href="Maca%C3%A9-class%20patrol%20vessel">Maca√©-class patrol vessel</a>s from Brazil as part of a Technical Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering the production of the vessels as part of Angola‚Äôs Naval Power Development Programme (Pronaval). The military of Angola aims to modernize its naval capability, presumably due to a rise in maritime piracy within the Gulf of Guinea which may have an adverse effect on the country's economy.

The navy's current known inventory includes the following:


The navy also has several aircraft for maritime patrol:

The FAA include several types of special forces, namely the Commandos, the Special Operations and the Marines. The Angolan special forces follow the general model of the analogous Portuguese special forces, receiving a similar training.

The Commandos and the Special forces are part of the Special Forces Brigade (BRIFE, "Brigada de For√ßas Especiais"), based at Cabo Ledo, in the <a href="Bengo%20Province">Bengo Province</a>. The BRIFE includes two battalions of commandos, a battalion of special operations and sub-units of combat support and service support. The BRIFE also included the Special Actions Group (GAE, "Grupo de A√ß√µes Especiais"), which is presently inactive and that was dedicated to long range reconnaissance, covert and sabotage operations. In the Cabo Ledo base is also installed the Special Forces Training School (EFFE, "Escola de Forma√ß√£o de For√ßas Especiais"). Both the BRIFE and the EFFE are directly under the Directorate of Special Forces of the General Staff of the Armed Forces.

The marines ("fuzileiros navais") constitute the Marines Brigade of the Angolan Navy. The Marines Brigade is not permanently dependent of the Directorate of Special Forces, but can detach their units and elements to be put under the command of that body for the conduction of exercises or real operations.

Since the disbandment of the Angolan Parachute Battalion in 2004, the FAA do not have a specialized paratrooper unit. However, elements of the commandos, special operations and marines are parachute qualified.

The FAPLA's main counterinsurgency effort was directed against UNITA in the southeast, and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared <a href="South%20African%20Border%20War">South African Border War</a>. The FAPLA first performed its external assistance mission with the dispatch of 1,000 to 1,500 troops to <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20and%20Pr%C3%ADncipe">S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe</a> in 1977 to bolster the socialist regime of President Manuel Pinto da Costa. During the next several years, Angolan forces conducted joint exercises with their counterparts and exchanged technical operational visits. The Angolan expeditionary force was reduced to about 500 in early 1985.

The Angolan Armed Forces were controversially involved in training the armed forces of fellow <a href="Lusophone">Lusophone</a> states <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> and Guinea-Bissau. In the case of the latter, the <a href="2012%20Guinea-Bissau%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'√©tat</a> was cited by the coup leaders as due to Angola's involvement in trying to "reform" the military in connivance with the civilian leadership.

A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (Kinshasa) and the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> (Brazzaville). A presence during the unrest in <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, 2010‚Äì2011, were not officially confirmed. However, the "<a href="Frankfurter%20Allgemeine%20Zeitung">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</a>", citing "<a href="Jeune%20Afrique">Jeune Afrique</a>", said that among President <a href="Gbagbo">Gbagbo</a>'s guards were 92 personnel of President Dos Santos's Presidential Guard Unit. Angola is basically interested in the participation of the FAA operations of the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a> and has formed special units for this purpose.

Foreign relations of Angola

The foreign relations of Angola are based on Angola's strong support of <a href="U.S.%20foreign%20policy">U.S. foreign policy</a> as the <a href="Angolan%20economy">Angolan economy</a> is dependent on U.S. foreign aid.

From 1975 to 1989, <a href="Angola">Angola</a> was aligned with the <a href="Eastern%20bloc">Eastern bloc</a>, in particular the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Libya%20under%20Muammar%20Gaddafi%23Great%20Socialist%20People%27s%20Libyan%20Arab%20Jamahiriya%20%281977%E2%80%932012%29">Libya</a>, and <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with <a href="Western%20world">Western countries</a>, cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in <a href="Central%20Africa">Central Africa</a> through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It has entered the <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">Southern African Development Community</a> as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south. <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> and <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> joined Angola in its military intervention in the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, where Angolan troops remain in support of the <a href="Joseph%20Kabila">Joseph Kabila</a> government. It also has intervened in the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> (Brazzaville) to support the existing government in that country.

Since 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> to impose and carry out sanctions on <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a>. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on <a href="conflict%20diamonds">conflict diamonds</a>, the primary source of revenue for UNITA during the Civil War that ended in 2002. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (<a href="CPLP">CPLP</a>) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> (its former ruler) and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> (which shares many cultural affinities with Angola) in particular. Angola is a member of the <a href="Port%20Management%20Association%20of%20Eastern%20and%20Southern%20Africa">Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa</a> (PMAESA).

<a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> signed a friendship accord with <a href="Angola">Angola</a> in December 1975, shortly after Angola gained its independence. Cape Verde and <a href="Guinea-Bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a> served as stop-over points for <a href="Cuban%20troops">Cuban troops</a> on their way to Angola to fight <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a> rebels and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>n troops. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Cape%20Verde">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Pedro%20Pires">Pedro Pires</a> sent <a href="Revolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20the%20People">FARP</a> soldiers to Angola where they served as the personal bodyguards of <a href="Angolan%20President">Angolan President</a> <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Eduardo%20dos%20Santos">Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos</a>.

Many thousands of Angolans fled the country after the civil war. More than 20,000 people were forced to leave the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> in 2009, an action the DR Congo said was in retaliation for regular expulsion of Congolese diamond miners who were in Angola illegally. Angola sent a delegation to DR Congo's capital <a href="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a> and succeeded in stopping government-forced expulsions which had become a "tit-for-tat" immigration dispute. "Congo and Angola have agreed to suspend expulsions from both sides of the border," said Lambert Mende, DR Congo information minister, in October 2009. "We never challenged the expulsions themselves; we challenged the way they were being conducted ‚Äî all the beating of people and looting their goods, even sometimes their clothes," Mende said.

Following a request by the government of <a href="Guinea-Bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a>, Angola sent there a contingent of about 300 troops meant to help putting an end to the political-military unrest in that country, and to reorganize the local military forces. In fact, these troops were perceived as a kind of <a href="Pretorian%20Guard">Pretorian Guard</a> for the ruling party, <a href="PAIGC">PAIGC</a>. In the beginning of April 2012, when a new military <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">Coup d'√©tat</a> was under preparation, the Angolan regime decided to withdraw its military mission from Guinea-Bissau.

Namibia borders Angola to the south. In 1999 Namibia signed a mutual defense pact with its northern neighbor <a href="Angola">Angola</a>.
This affected the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">Angolan Civil War</a> that had been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Namibia's ruling party <a href="SWAPO">SWAPO</a> sought to support the ruling party <a href="MPLA">MPLA</a> in Angola against the rebel movement <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a>, whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering to Namibia. The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking <a href="Jonas%20Savimbi">Jonas Savimbi</a>'s UNITA.

Angolan-Nigerian relations are primarily based on their roles as oil exporting nations. Both are members of the <a href="Organization%20of%20the%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</a>, the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a> and other multilateral organizations.

Angola-South Africa relations are quite strong as the ruling parties in both nations, the African National Congress in South Africa and the MPLA in Angola, fought together during the Angolan Civil War and South African Border War. They fought against UNITA rebels, based in Angola, and the apartheid-era government in South Africa who supported them. Nelson Mandela mediated between the MPLA and UNITA factions during the last years of Angola's civil war.

Angola-Zimbabwe relations have remained cordial since the birth of both states, Angola in 1975 and Zimbabwe in 1979, during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. While Angola's foreign policy shifted to a pro-U.S. stance based on <a href="Economy%20of%20Angola">substantial economic ties</a>, under the rule of <a href="President%20of%20Zimbabwe">President</a> <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> Zimbabwe's ties with the <a href="Western%20world">West</a> soured in the late 1990s.




Relations between the two countries have not always been cordial due to the former <a href="French%20government">French government</a>'s policy of supporting militant separatists in Angola's <a href="Cabinda%20province">Cabinda province</a> and the international <a href="Angolagate">Angolagate</a> scandal embarrassed both governments by exposing corruption and illicit arms deals. Following French President <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>'s visit in 2008, relations have improved.

Angola-Portugal relations have significantly improved since the <a href="Angola">Angola</a>n government abandoned <a href="communism">communism</a> and nominally embraced <a href="democracy">democracy</a> in 1991, embracing a pro-<a href="Angola-United%20States%20relations">U.S.</a> and to a lesser degree pro-<a href="Europe">Europe</a> foreign policy. <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> ruled Angola for 400 years, colonizing the territory from 1483 until independence in 1975. Angola's war for <a href="Angolan%20War%20for%20Independence">independence</a> did not end in a military victory for either side, but was suspended as a result of a <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">coup in Portugal</a> that replaced the <a href="Marcelo%20Caetano">Caetano regime</a>.

Russia has an <a href="embassy">embassy</a> in <a href="Luanda">Luanda</a>. Angola has an <a href="Embassy%20of%20Angola%20in%20Moscow">embassy in Moscow</a> and an honorary consulate in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. Angola and the precursor to Russia, the Soviet Union, established relations upon Angola's independence.


The Defence Minister of Serbia, <a href="Dragan%20%C5%A0utanovac">Dragan ≈†utanovac</a>, stated in a 2011 meeting in Luanda that Serbia would negotiate with the Angolan military authorities for the construction of a new military hospital in Angola.



Commercial and economic ties dominate the relations of each country. Parts of both countries were part of the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a> from the early 16th century until Brazil's independence in 1822. As of November 2007, "trade between the two countries is booming as never before"

Canada-Angola relations were established in 1978, and Canada is accredited to Angola from a mission in <a href="Harare%2C%20Zimbabwe">Harare, Zimbabwe</a>. Trade was established through Canada Trade Office <a href="Johannesburg%2C%20South%20Africa">Johannesburg, South Africa</a>, & ties have grown since the end of the civil war in 2002, w/ increased engagement in areas of mutual interest. As Chair of the United Nations Security Council's Angola Sanctions Committee, Canada limited the ability of <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a> to continue its military campaign, sanctions helped to bring a ceasefire agreement to end Angola‚Äôs conflict.


During <a href="Angola%27s%20civil%20war">Angola's civil war</a> <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>n forces fought to install a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist MPLA-PT government, against <a href="Western%20world">Western</a>-backed <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a> and <a href="FLNA">FLNA</a> guerrillas and the South-African army.


From the mid-1980s through at least 1992, the United States was the primary source of military and other support for the <a href="UNITA">UNITA</a> rebel movement, which was led from its creation through 2002 by <a href="Jonas%20Savimbi">Jonas Savimbi</a>. The U.S. refused to recognize Angola diplomatically during this period.

Relations between the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a> and the <a href="Angola">Republic of Angola</a> (formerly the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Angola">People's Republic of Angola</a>) have warmed since Angola's ideological renunciation of <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> before the <a href="Angolan%20presidential%20election%2C%201992">1992 elections</a>.

<a href="Chinese%20Prime%20Minister">Chinese Prime Minister</a> <a href="Wen%20Jiabao">Wen Jiabao</a> visited Angola in June 2006, offering a US$9 billion loan for infrastructure improvements in return for petroleum. The PRC has invested heavily in Angola since the end of the civil war in 2002. <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Manuel%20Bernardo">Jo√£o Manuel Bernardo</a>, the current <a href="ambassador">ambassador</a> of <a href="Angola">Angola</a> to China, visited the PRC in November 2007.

In February 2006, Angola surpassed Saudi Arabia to become the number one supplier of oil to China.<a href="http%3A//codrinarsene.com/2008/10/angola-china-relations/"></a> <a href="http%3A//www.african-politics.com/2008/10/angola-china-relations/"></a>

Angola-Israel relations, primarily based on trade and pro-United States foreign policies, are excellent. In March 2006, the trade volume between the two countries amounted to $400 million. The Israeli ambassador to Angola is Avraham Benjamin.[1] In 2005, President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos visited Israel.

Diplomatic relations between <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and Angola were established in September 1976. Japan maintains an embassy at Luanda and Angola has an embassy in Tokyo. As of 2007, economic relations played "a fundamental role in the bilateral relations between the two governments". Japan has donated towards demining following the civil war.

The Government of Angola called for the support of <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> for the candidature of Angola to the seat of non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, whose election is set for September this year, during the 69th session of the General Assembly of United Nations. On the fringes of the ceremony, the Angolan diplomat also met with officials in charge of the economic and commercial policy of Pakistan, to assess the business opportunities between the two states. It asked to discuss aspects related to the cooperation on several domains of common interest.

Establishment of diplomatic relations 6 January 1992. The number of South Koreans living in Angola in 2011 was 279.

Angola-Vietnam relations were established in August 1971, four years before <a href="Angolan%20War%20of%20Independence">Angola gained its independence</a>, when future <a href="President%20of%20Angola">President of Angola</a> <a href="Agostinho%20Neto">Agostinho Neto</a> visited <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. <a href="Angola">Angola</a> and Vietnam have steadfast partners as both transitioned from <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>-era foreign policies of <a href="Proletarian%20internationalism">international communism</a> to pro-<a href="Western%20world">Western</a> pragmatism following the fall of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

Albert Sidney Johnston

Albert Sidney Johnston (February 2, 1803 ‚Äì April 6, 1862) served as a <a href="General%20officer">general</a> in three different armies: the <a href="Texian%20Army">Texian ("i.e." Republic of Texas) Army</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a>. He saw extensive combat during his military career, fighting actions in the <a href="Black%20Hawk%20War">Black Hawk War</a>, <a href="Texas%20War%20of%20Independence">Texas War of Independence</a>, the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War</a>, the <a href="Utah%20War">Utah War</a>, and the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

Considered by Confederate States President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> to be the finest general officer in the Confederacy before the later emergence of <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, he was killed early in the Civil War at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> on April 6, 1862. Johnston was the highest-ranking officer, Union or Confederate, killed during the entire war. Davis believed the loss of Gen. Johnston "was the turning point of our fate."

Johnston was unrelated to Confederate general <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>.

Johnston was born in <a href="Washington%2C%20Kentucky">Washington, Kentucky</a>, the youngest son of Dr. John and Abigail (Harris) Johnston. His father was a native of <a href="Salisbury%2C%20Connecticut">Salisbury, Connecticut</a>. Although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky, he lived much of his life in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, which he considered his home. He was first educated at <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a> in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, where he met fellow student <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>. Both were appointed to the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point, New York</a>, Davis two years behind Johnston. In 1826, Johnston graduated eighth of 41 cadets in his class from West Point with a commission as a <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="Second%20Lieutenant%23United%20States">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="2nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">2nd U.S. Infantry</a>.

Johnston was assigned to posts in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> and <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> and served in the brief <a href="Black%20Hawk%20War">Black Hawk War</a> in 1832 as chief of staff to Bvt. Brig. Gen. <a href="Henry%20Atkinson%20%28soldier%29">Henry Atkinson</a>.

In 1829 he married Henrietta Preston, sister of Kentucky politician and future Civil War general <a href="William%20Preston%20%28Kentucky%29">William Preston</a>. They had one son, <a href="William%20Preston%20Johnston">William Preston Johnston</a>, who became a colonel in the Confederate States Army. The senior Johnston resigned his commission in 1834 in order to care for his dying wife in Kentucky, who succumbed two years later to <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>.

After serving as Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas from 1838 to 1840, Johnston resigned and returned to Kentucky. In 1843, he married Eliza Griffin, his late wife's first cousin. The couple moved to Texas, where they settled on a large <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a> in <a href="Brazoria%20County%2C%20Texas">Brazoria County</a>. Johnston named the property "China Grove". Here they raised Johnston's two children from his first marriage and the first three children born to Eliza and him. (A sixth child was born later when they lived in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>).

In 1836 Johnston moved to Texas. He enlisted as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the Texas Army during the <a href="Texas%20War%20of%20Independence">Texas War of Independence</a> against the Republic of Mexico. He was named <a href="Adjutant%20General">Adjutant General</a> as a <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> in the Republic of Texas Army on August 5, 1836. On January 31, 1837, he became senior <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> in command of the Texas Army.

On February 5, 1837, he fought in a duel with Texas Brig. Gen. <a href="Felix%20Huston">Felix Huston</a>, as they challenged each other for the command of the Texas Army; Johnston refused to fire on Huston and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis.

On December 22, 1838, <a href="Mirabeau%20B.%20Lamar">Mirabeau B. Lamar</a>, the second president of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>, appointed Johnston as Secretary of War. He provided for the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indians</a> in northern Texas. In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky.

Johnston returned to Texas during the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War</a> (1846-1848), under General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> as a <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers. The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monterrey">Battle of Monterrey</a>. Johnston convinced a few volunteers to stay and fight as he served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and <a href="Battle%20of%20Buena%20Vista">Buena Vista</a>.

He remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by later 12th President <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> as a <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> and was made a paymaster in December 1849. He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than annually on the Indian frontier of Texas. He served on the Texas frontier at <a href="Fort%20Mason%20%28Texas%29">Fort Mason</a> and elsewhere in the West.

In 1855, 14th President <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> appointed him colonel of the new 2nd U.S. Cavalry (the unit that preceded the modern <a href="5th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th U.S.</a>), a new regiment, which he organized. On August 19, 1856, Gen. <a href="Persifor%20Smith">Persifor Smith</a>, at the request of Kansas Territorial Governor Wilson Shannon, sent Col. Johnston with 1300 men composed of the 2d Cavalry Dragoons from <a href="Fort%20Riley">Fort Riley</a>, a battalion of the 6th Infantry and <a href="Albion%20P.%20Howe">Capt. Howe's</a> artillery company from <a href="Jefferson%20Barracks%20Military%20Post">Jefferson Barracks</a>, near <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a> to protect the <a href="Kansas%20Territory">territorial</a> capital at <a href="Lecompton%2C%20Kansas">Lecompton</a> from an imminent attack by <a href="James%20Henry%20Lane%20%28Union%20general%29">James Henry Lane</a> and his abolitionist "Army of the North."

As a key figure in the <a href="Utah%20War">Utah War</a>, Johnston led U.S. troops who established a non-<a href="Mormons">Mormon</a> government in the formerly <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">Mormon</a> territory. He received a <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> promotion to <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in 1857 for his service in Utah. He spent 1860 in Kentucky until December 21, when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.

At the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Pacific">Department of the Pacific</a> in <a href="California%20and%20the%20Civil%20War">California</a>. Like many regular army officers from the South, he was opposed to secession. But he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of his adopted state of Texas. It was accepted by the War Department on May 6, 1861, effective May 3. On April 28 he moved to Los Angeles, the home of his wife's brother John Griffin. Considering staying in California with his wife and five children, Johnston remained there until May.

Soon, under suspicion by local Union officials, he evaded arrest and joined the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Mounted%20Rifles">Los Angeles Mounted Rifles</a> as a private, leaving <a href="Warner%27s%20Ranch">Warner's Ranch</a> May 27. He participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to Texas, crossing the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> into the <a href="Confederate%20Territory%20of%20Arizona">Confederate Territory of Arizona</a> on July 4, 1861.

Early in the Civil War, Confederate President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> decided that the Confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible, and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts. In the summer of 1861, Davis appointed several generals to defend Confederate lines from the Mississippi River east to the Allegheny Mountains.

The most sensitive, and in many ways the most crucial areas, along the Mississippi River and in western Tennessee along the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee</a> and the <a href="Cumberland%20River">Cumberland</a> rivers were placed under the command of <a href="Major%20General%20%28CSA%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="Leonidas%20Polk">Leonidas Polk</a> and <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28CSA%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="Gideon%20J.%20Pillow">Gideon J. Pillow</a>. The latter had initially been in command in Tennessee as that State's top general. Their impolitic occupation of <a href="Columbus%2C%20Kentucky">Columbus, Kentucky</a>, on September 3, 1861, two days before Johnston arrived in the Confederacy's capital of <a href="Richmond%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Richmond, Virginia</a>, after his cross-country journey, drove Kentucky from its stated neutrality. The majority of Kentuckians allied with the Union camp. Polk and Pillow's action gave Union <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah, Kentucky</a>, without raising the ire of most Kentuckians and the pro-Union majority in the State legislature.

On September 10, 1861, Johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the Confederacy west of the Allegheny Mountains, except for coastal areas. He became commander of the Confederacy's western armies in the area often called the <a href="Western%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Western Department</a> or Western Military Department. Johnston's appointment as a <a href="General%20%28CSA%29">full general</a> by his friend and admirer Jefferson Davis already had been confirmed by the Confederate Senate on August 31, 1861. The appointment had been backdated to rank from May 30, 1861, making him the second highest ranking general in the Confederate States Army. Only Adjutant General and Inspector General <a href="Samuel%20Cooper%20%28general%29">Samuel Cooper</a> ranked ahead of him. After his appointment, Johnston immediately headed for his new territory. He was permitted to call on governors of Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi for new troops, although this authority was largely stifled by politics, especially with respect to Mississippi. On September 13, 1861, Johnston ordered Brig. Gen. <a href="Felix%20Zollicoffer">Felix Zollicoffer</a> with 4,000 men to occupy <a href="Cumberland%20Gap">Cumberland Gap</a> in Kentucky in order to block Union troops from coming into eastern Tennessee. The Kentucky legislature had voted to side with the Union after the occupation of Columbus by Polk. By September 18, Johnston had Brig. Gen. <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner">Simon Bolivar Buckner</a> with another 4,000 men blocking the railroad route to Tennessee at <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green, Kentucky</a>.

Johnston had fewer than 40,000 men spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri. Of these, 10,000 were in Missouri under <a href="Missouri%20State%20Guard">Missouri State Guard</a> Maj. Gen. <a href="Sterling%20Price">Sterling Price</a>. Johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors, but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had. As the Confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the East, they gave Johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material. Johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did, a strategy that worked for several months. Johnston's tactics had so annoyed and confused Union Brig. Gen. <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> in Kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable. Sherman overestimated Johnston's forces, and had to be relieved by Brig. Gen. <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a> on November 9, 1861.

Eastern Tennessee was held for the Confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by Jefferson Davis: Felix Zollicoffer, a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer, and soon-to-be Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20B.%20Crittenden">George B. Crittenden</a>, a former U.S. Army officer with apparent alcohol problems. While Crittenden was away in Richmond, Zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper Cumberland River near Mill Springs (now <a href="Nancy%2C%20Kentucky">Nancy, Kentucky</a>), putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap. Zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of Union troops. When Union Brig. Gen. <a href="George%20H.%20Thomas">George H. Thomas</a> moved against the Confederates, Crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of Thomas's command at Logan's Cross Roads near Mill Springs before the Union forces could unite. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mill%20Springs">Battle of Mill Springs</a> on January 19, 1862, the ill-prepared Confederates, after a night march in the rain, attacked the Union force with some initial success. As the battle progressed, Zollicoffer was killed, Crittenden was unable to lead the Confederate force (he may have been intoxicated), and the Confederates were turned back and routed by a Union bayonet charge, suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4,000. The Confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as General Crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct.

After the Confederate defeat at the Mill Springs, Davis sent Johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements. He also assigned him Gen. <a href="P.%20G.%20T.%20Beauregard">P. G. T. Beauregard</a>, who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war, and act as a competent subordinate for Johnston. The brigade was led by Brig. Gen. <a href="John%20B.%20Floyd">John B. Floyd</a>, considered incompetent. He took command at <a href="Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> as the senior general present just before Union Brig. Gen. <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> attacked the fort. Historians believe the assignment of Beauregard to the west stimulated Union commanders to attack the forts before Beauregard could make a difference in the theater. Union officers heard that he was bringing 15 regiments with him, but this was an exaggeration of his forces.

Based on the assumption that Kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north, Tennessee initially had sent men to Virginia and concentrated defenses in the Mississippi Valley, circumstances that no longer applied in September 1861. Even before Johnston arrived in Tennessee, construction of two forts had been started to defend the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee</a> and the <a href="Cumberland%20River">Cumberland</a> rivers, which provided avenues into the State from the north. Both forts were located in Tennessee in order to respect Kentucky neutrality, but these were not in ideal locations. <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry">Fort Henry</a> on the Tennessee River was in an unfavorable low-lying location, commanded by hills on the Kentucky side of the river. <a href="Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> on the Cumberland River, although in a better location, had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats.

Maj. Gen. Polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command. After Johnston took command, Polk at first refused to comply with Johnston's order to send an engineer, Lt. Joseph K. Dixon, to inspect the forts. After Johnston asserted his authority, Polk had to allow Dixon to proceed. Dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened, although they were not in ideal locations, because much work had been done on them and the Confederates might not have time to build new ones. Johnston accepted his recommendations. Johnston wanted Major <a href="Alexander%20P.%20Stewart">Alexander P. Stewart</a> to command the forts but President Davis appointed Brig. Gen. <a href="Lloyd%20Tilghman">Lloyd Tilghman</a> as commander.

To prevent Polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group, Johnston ordered him to send Brig. Gen. Gideon Pillow and 5,000 men to Fort Donelson. Pillow took up a position at nearby <a href="Clarksville%2C%20Tennessee">Clarksville, Tennessee</a> and did not move into the fort until February 7, 1862. Alerted by a Union reconnaissance on January 14, 1862, Johnston ordered Tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite Fort Henry, which Polk had failed to do despite Johnston's orders. Tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders, which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out.

Gen. Beauregard arrived at Johnston's headquarters at Bowling Green on February 4, 1862, and was given overall command of Polk's force at the western end of Johnston's line at Columbus, Kentucky. On February 6, 1862, <a href="Union%20Navy">Union Navy</a> gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of ill-sited Fort Henry, inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining Confederate force. Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman surrendered the 94 remaining officers and men of his approximately 3,000-man force which had not been sent to Fort Donelson before U.S. Grant's force could even take up their positions. Johnston knew he could be trapped at Bowling Green if Fort Donelson fell, so he moved his force to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>, the capital of Tennessee and an increasingly important Confederate industrial center, beginning on February 11, 1862.

Johnston also reinforced Fort Donelson with 12,000 more men, including those under Floyd and Pillow, a curious decision in view of his thought that the Union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort. He did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held. The senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison, Gideon J. Pillow and John B. Floyd, squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on February 16, 1862, Brig. Gen. Simon Buckner, having been abandoned by Floyd and Pillow, surrendered Fort Donelson. Colonel <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a> escaped with his cavalry force of about 700 men before the surrender. The Confederates suffered about 1,500 casualties with an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 taken prisoner. Union casualties were 500 killed, 2,108 wounded, 224 missing.

Johnston, who had little choice in allowing Floyd and Pillow to take charge at Fort Donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison, took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the Confederate position. His passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at Bowling Green, spreading his forces too thinly, not concentrating his forces in the face of Union advances, and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians. The fall of the forts exposed Nashville to imminent attack, and it fell without resistance to Union forces under Brig. Gen. Buell on February 25, 1862, two days after Johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well.

Johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off. Johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command, the <a href="Army%20of%20Central%20Kentucky">Army of Central Kentucky</a>, from the vicinity of Nashville. With Beauregard's help, Johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under Polk and now already under Beauregard's command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>, which he reached by a circuitous route. Johnston kept the Union forces, now under the overall command of the ponderous Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry%20Halleck">Henry Halleck</a>, confused and hesitant to move, allowing Johnston to reach his objective undetected. This delay allowed Jefferson Davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general, <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a>, to help organize the western forces. Bragg at least calmed the nerves of Beauregard and Polk who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces before the arrival of Johnston on March 24, 1862.

Johnston's army of 17,000 men gave the Confederates a combined force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at Corinth. On March 29, 1862, Johnston officially took command of this combined force, which continued to use the Army of the Mississippi name under which it had been organized by Beauregard on March 5.

Johnston now planned to defeat the Union forces piecemeal before the various Union units in Kentucky and Tennessee under Grant with 40,000 men at nearby <a href="Pittsburg%20Landing%2C%20Tennessee">Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee</a>, and the now Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell on his way from Nashville with 35,000 men, could unite against him. Johnston started his army in motion on April 3, 1862, intent on surprising Grant's force as soon as the next day, but they moved slowly due to their inexperience, bad roads and lack of adequate staff planning. Due to the delays, as well as several contacts with the enemy, Johnston's second in command, <a href="P.%20G.%20T.%20Beauregard">P. G. T. Beauregard</a>, felt the element of surprise had been lost and recommended calling off the attack. Johnston decided to proceed as planned, stating "I would fight them if they were a million." His army was finally in position within a mile or two of Grant's force, and undetected, by the evening of April 5, 1862.

Johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against Grant at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> on April 6, 1862. As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse. At about 2:30¬†pm, while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the "Peach Orchard," he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. He apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time, or even possibly did not feel it. It is possible that Johnston's duel in 1837 had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result. The bullet had in fact clipped a part of his <a href="popliteal%20artery">popliteal artery</a> and his boot was filling up with blood. There were no medical personnel on scene at the time, since Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners earlier in the battle.

Within a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting. Among his staff was <a href="Isham%20G.%20Harris">Isham G. Harris</a>, the <a href="Governor%20of%20Tennessee">Governor of Tennessee</a>, who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> had appointed <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: "General, are you wounded?" Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and replied in a weak voice his last words: "Yes... and I fear seriously." Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the "Hornets Nest" and desperately tried to aid the general who had lost consciousness by this point. Harris then sent an aide to fetch Johnston's surgeon, but did not apply a tourniquet to Johnson's wounded leg. Before a doctor could be found, Johnston died from blood loss a few minutes later. It is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound. Ironically, it was later discovered that Johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died.

Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, named Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent until the Confederate Army withdrew to Corinth the next day, April 7, 1862, after failing to gain a decisive victory over the Union armies. From there, his body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours.

It is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round. No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge, while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers. Furthermore, the surgeon who later dug the bullet out of Johnston's leg identified the round as one fired from a <a href="Pattern%201853%20Enfield">Pattern 1853 Enfield</a>. No Union troops in the area where Johnston was hit had been issued Enfield rifles, whereas the Enfield rifle was standard issue for the Confederate forces Johnston was leading.

Johnston was the highest-ranking fatality of the war on either side, and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confederacy. At the time, Jefferson Davis considered him the best general in the country.

Johnston was survived by his wife Eliza and six children. His wife and five younger children, including one born after he went to war, chose to live out their days at home in Los Angeles with Eliza's brother, Dr. <a href="John%20Strother%20Griffin">John Strother Griffin</a>. Johnston's eldest son, Albert Sidney Jr. (born in Texas), had already followed him into the Confederate States Army. In 1863, after taking home leave in Los Angeles, Albert Jr. was on his way out of <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20California">San Pedro</a> harbor on a ferry. While a steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry, a wave swamped the smaller boat, causing its boilers to explode. Albert Jr. was killed in the accident.

Killed in action, General Johnston received the highest praise ever given by the Confederate government; accounts were published, on December 20, 1862, and thereafter, in the Los Angeles "Star" of his family's hometown. Johnston Street, Hancock Street, and Griffin Avenue, each in <a href="Lincoln%20Heights%2C%20Los%20Angeles">northeast Los Angeles</a>, are named after the general and his family, who lived in the neighborhood.

Johnston was initially buried in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. In 1866, a joint resolution of the <a href="Texas%20Legislature">Texas Legislature</a> was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the <a href="Texas%20State%20Cemetery">Texas State Cemetery</a> in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a>. The re-interment occurred in 1867. Forty years later, the state appointed <a href="Elisabet%20Ney">Elisabet Ney</a> to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the grave site.

The <a href="Texas%20Historical%20Commission">Texas Historical Commission</a> has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once Johnston's <a href="plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a>. An adjacent marker was erected by the San Jacinto Chapter of the <a href="Daughters%20of%20The%20Republic%20of%20Texas">Daughters of The Republic of Texas</a> and the Lee, Roberts, and Davis Chapter of the <a href="United%20Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederate States of America</a>.

In 1916, the University of Texas at Austin recognized several confederate veterans (including Johnston) with statues on its South Mall. On August 21, 2017, as part of the wave of <a href="Removal%20of%20Confederate%20monuments%20and%20memorials">confederate monument removals in America</a>, Johnston's statue was taken down. Plans were announced to add it to the <a href="Dolph%20Briscoe%20Center%20for%20American%20History">Briscoe Center for American History</a> on the east side of the university campus.

Android (robot)

An android is a <a href="humanoid%20robot">humanoid robot</a> or <a href="synthetic%20biology">synthetic organism</a> designed to look and act like a <a href="human">human</a>, especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance. Historically, androids remained completely within the domain of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> where they are frequently seen in film and television. Only recently have advancements in <a href="robotics">robot technology</a> allowed the design of functional and realistic <a href="humanoid%20robot">humanoid robot</a>s.

The word was coined from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> root ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅ-, "man" (male, as opposed to "anthrop-", human being) and the suffix "", "having the form or likeness of". While the term "android" is used in reference to human-looking robots in general, a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a "gynoid".

The "Oxford English Dictionary" traces the earliest use (as "Androides") to <a href="Ephraim%20Chambers">Ephraim Chambers</a>' "<a href="Cyclopaedia%2C%20or%20an%20Universal%20Dictionary%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Cyclopaedia</a>," in reference to an <a href="automaton">automaton</a> that St. <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a> allegedly created. The term "android" appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons. The term "android" was used in a more modern sense by the French author <a href="Auguste%20Villiers%20de%20l%27Isle-Adam">Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam</a> in his work "<a href="The%20Future%20Eve">Tomorrow's Eve</a>" (1886). This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, "In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls." The term made an impact into English <a href="pulp%20science%20fiction">pulp science fiction</a> starting from <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cometeers">The Cometeers</a>" (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>'s <a href="Captain%20Future">Captain Future</a> (1940‚Äì1944).

Although <a href="Karel%20Capek">Karel ƒåapek's</a> robots in "<a href="R.U.R.">R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)</a>" (1921)‚Äîthe play that introduced the word "<a href="robot">robot</a>" to the world‚Äîwere organic artificial humans, the word "robot" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings. The term "android" can mean either one of these, while a cyborg ("cybernetic organism" or "bionic man") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.

The term "<a href="Droid%20%28robot%29">droid</a>", popularized by <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a> in the original "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of "android", but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines like <a href="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>. The word "android" was used in "" episode "<a href="What%20Are%20Little%20Girls%20Made%20Of%3F">What Are Little Girls Made Of?</a>" The abbreviation "andy", coined as a <a href="pejorative">pejorative</a> by writer <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a> in his novel "<a href="Do%20Androids%20Dream%20of%20Electric%20Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>", has seen some further usage, such as within the TV series "<a href="Total%20Recall%202070">Total Recall 2070</a>".

Authors have used the term "android" in more diverse ways than "<a href="robot">robot</a>" or "<a href="cyborg">cyborg</a>". In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics. In other stories, authors have used the word "android" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation. Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.

Eric G. Wilson, who defines androids as a "synthetic human being", distinguishes between three types of androids, based on their body's composition:

Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: "<a href="Simulacrum">simulacra</a>" (devices that exhibit likeness) and "<a href="Automata%20theory">automata</a>" (devices that have independence).

Several projects aiming to create androids that look, and, to a certain degree, speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway.

<a href="Japanese%20robotics">Japanese robotics</a> have been leading the field since the 1970s. <a href="Waseda%20University">Waseda University</a> initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the first android, a full-scale humanoid intelligent robot. Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.

In 1984, WABOT-2 was revealed, and made a number of improvements. It was capable of playing the organ. Wabot-2 had 10 fingers and two feet, and was able to read a score of music. It was also able to accompany a person. In 1986, <a href="Honda">Honda</a> began its humanoid research and development program, to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans.

The Intelligent Robotics Lab, directed by <a href="Hiroshi%20Ishiguro">Hiroshi Ishiguro</a> at <a href="Osaka%20University">Osaka University</a>, and Kokoro Co., Ltd. have demonstrated the <a href="Actroid">Actroid</a> at <a href="Expo%202005">Expo 2005</a> in <a href="Aichi%20Prefecture">Aichi Prefecture</a>, Japan and released the <a href="Telenoid%20R1">Telenoid R1</a> in 2010. In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new "DER 2" android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165¬†cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The "air servosystem" which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.

The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the <a href="Tokyo%20University%20of%20Science">Tokyo University of Science</a>, has developed an android head called "Saya", which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is "working" at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.

The <a href="Waseda%20University">Waseda University</a> (Japan) and <a href="NTT%20docomo">NTT Docomo's</a> manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot "WD-2". It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three <a href="degrees%20of%20freedom%20%28mechanics%29">degrees of freedom</a>. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To "copy" a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.

Prof Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine. Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple‚Äôs <a href="Siri">Siri</a> or Microsoft‚Äôs <a href="Cortana%20%28software%29">Cortana</a>. Nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future, or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly.

Assoc Prof Gerald Seet from the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and the BeingThere Centre led a three-year R&D development in tele-presence robotics, creating EDGAR. A remote user can control EDGAR with the user‚Äôs face and expressions displayed on the robot‚Äôs face in real time. The robot also mimics their upper body movements.
<a href="KITECH">KITECH</a> researched and developed <a href="EveR-1">EveR-1</a>, an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial "musculature" and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words. She is tall and weighs , matching the average figure of a Korean woman in her twenties. EveR-1's name derives from the <a href="Eve">Biblical Eve</a>, plus the letter "r" for "robot". EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enables <a href="speech%20recognition">speech recognition</a> and vocal synthesis, at the same time processing <a href="lip%20synchronization">lip synchronization</a> and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-<a href="charge-coupled%20device">CCD</a> cameras with <a href="facial%20recognition%20system">face recognition technology</a>. An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression, body coordination, and emotion expression. Her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face, neck, and lower body; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing. In South Korea, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20and%20Communication%20%28South%20Korea%29">Ministry of Information and Communication</a> has an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020. Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2016 at a cost of 500 billion won (440 million USD), of which 50 billion is direct government investment. The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.

Walt Disney and a staff of <a href="Imagineers">Imagineers</a> created <a href="Great%20Moments%20with%20Mr.%20Lincoln">Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln</a> that debuted at the <a href="1964%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1964 New York World's Fair</a>.

<a href="David%20Hanson%20%28robotics%20designer%29">Hanson Robotics, Inc.</a>, of Texas and <a href="KAIST">KAIST</a> produced an android portrait of <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, using Hanson's facial android technology mounted on KAIST's life-size walking bipedal robot body. This Einstein android, also called "<a href="Albert%20Hubo">Albert Hubo</a>", thus represents the first full-body walking android in history (see video at). Hanson Robotics, the FedEx Institute of Technology, and the University of Texas at Arlington also developed the android portrait of sci-fi author <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a> (creator of "<a href="Do%20Androids%20Dream%20of%20Electric%20Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>", the basis for the film "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>"), with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author's works. In 2005, the PKD android won a first place <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> award from <a href="Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence">AAAI</a>.

Androids are a staple of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>. <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> pioneered the fictionalization of the science of <a href="robotics">robotics</a> and <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, notably in his 1950s series "<a href="I%2C%20Robot">I, Robot</a>". One thing common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots‚Äîsuch as the creation of <a href="artificial%20general%20intelligence">strong artificial intelligence</a>‚Äîare assumed to have been solved. Fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans‚Äîmoving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.

The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance‚Äîor even human ambitions‚Äîof androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions. Some android heroes seek, like <a href="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>, to become human, as in the films "<a href="Bicentennial%20Man%20%28film%29">Bicentennial Man</a>", "<a href="Hollywood%20%28Kannada%20film%29">Hollywood</a>", "<a href="Enthiran">Enthiran</a>" and "<a href="A.I.%20Artificial%20Intelligence">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a>", or <a href="Data%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Data</a> in "". Others, as in the film "<a href="Westworld%20%28film%29">Westworld</a>", rebel against abuse by careless humans. Android hunter <a href="Rick%20Deckard">Deckard</a> in "<a href="Do%20Androids%20Dream%20of%20Electric%20Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>" and its film adaptation "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>" discovers that his targets are, in some ways, more human than he is. Android stories, therefore, are not essentially stories "about" androids; they are stories about the <a href="human%20condition">human condition</a> and what it means to be human.

One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring <a href="racism">racism</a> in society, as in "Blade Runner". Perhaps the clearest example of this is <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner's</a> 1968 novel "<a href="Into%20the%20Slave%20Nebula">Into the Slave Nebula</a>", where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human. More recently, the androids <a href="Bishop%20%28Aliens%29">Bishop</a> and Annalee Call in the films "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>" and "<a href="Alien%20Resurrection">Alien Resurrection</a>" are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an "<a href="Other%20%28philosophy%29">Other</a>".

Female androids, or "<a href="gynoid">gynoid</a>s", are often seen in science fiction, and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical "perfect woman". Examples include the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek myth</a> of "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28mythology%29">Pygmalion</a>" and <a href="Maschinenmensch">the female robot Maria</a> in <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s "<a href="Metropolis%20%281927%20film%29">Metropolis</a>". Some gynoids, like Pris in "Blade Runner", are designed as sex-objects, with the intent of "pleasing men's violent sexual desires," or as submissive, servile companions, such as in "<a href="The%20Stepford%20Wives">The Stepford Wives</a>". Fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing "essentialist ideas of femininity", although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and <a href="misogyny">misogyny</a> in society.

The 2015 Japanese film "<a href="Sayonara%20%282015%20film%29">Sayonara</a>", starring <a href="Geminoid%20F">Geminoid F</a>, was promoted as "the first movie to feature an android performing opposite a human actor".

In the 2009 film "<a href="Surrogates">Surrogates</a>", people purchase remote-controlled humanoid robots through which they interact with society.

Alberta

Alberta () is a western <a href="provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">province</a> of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. With an estimated population of 4,067,175 as of <a href="Canada%202016%20Census">2016 census</a>, it is <a href="List%20of%20Canadian%20provinces%20and%20territories%20by%20population">Canada's fourth-most populous province</a> and the most populous of Canada's three <a href="Canadian%20Prairies">prairie provinces</a>. Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> were <a href="districts%20of%20the%20Northwest%20Territories">districts of the Northwest Territories</a> until they were established as provinces on September¬†1, 1905. The <a href="premier%20of%20Alberta">premier</a> has been <a href="Rachel%20Notley">Rachel Notley</a> since May 2015.

Alberta is bounded by the provinces of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a> to the north, and the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Montana">Montana</a> to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces. It has a predominantly <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a>, with stark contrasts over a year; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east, due to winters being warmed by occasional <a href="chinook%20wind">chinook wind</a>s bringing sudden warming.

Alberta's capital, <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's <a href="crude%20oil">crude oil</a>, the <a href="Athabasca%20oil%20sands">Athabasca oil sands</a> and other northern resource industries.

About south of the capital is <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Alberta">largest city in Alberta</a>. Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta's two <a href="census%20metropolitan%20area">census metropolitan area</a>s, both of which have populations exceeding one million, while the province has <a href="List%20of%20census%20agglomerations%20in%20Alberta">16 census agglomerations</a>. Tourist destinations in the province include <a href="Banff%2C%20Alberta">Banff</a>, <a href="Canmore%2C%20Alberta">Canmore</a>, <a href="Drumheller">Drumheller</a>, <a href="Jasper%2C%20Alberta">Jasper</a> and <a href="Sylvan%20Lake%2C%20Alberta">Sylvan Lake</a>.

Alberta is named after <a href="Princess%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Argyll">Princess Louise Caroline Alberta</a> (1848‚Äì1939), the fourth daughter of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Princess Louise was the wife of <a href="John%20Campbell%2C%209th%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne</a>, <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a> (1878‚Äì83). <a href="Lake%20Louise%20%28Alberta%29">Lake Louise</a> and <a href="Mount%20Alberta">Mount Alberta</a> were also named in her honour.

Alberta, with an area of , is the fourth largest province after <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, Ontario and British Columbia. To the south, the province borders on the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel north</a>, separating it from the US state of <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, while on the north the <a href="60th%20parallel%20north">60th parallel north</a> divides it from the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a>. To the east, the <a href="110th%20meridian%20west">110th meridian west</a> separates it from the province of <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the <a href="120th%20meridian%20west">120th meridian west</a> south from the Northwest Territories at 60¬∞N until it reaches the <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a> at the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49¬∞N.

The province extends north to south and east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is at the summit of <a href="Mount%20Columbia%20%28Canada%29">Mount Columbia</a> in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is on the <a href="Slave%20River">Slave River</a> in <a href="Wood%20Buffalo%20National%20Park">Wood Buffalo National Park</a> in the northeast.

With the exception of the <a href="semi-arid">semi-arid</a> <a href="steppe">steppe</a> of the south-eastern section, the province has adequate <a href="water%20resources">water resources</a>. There are numerous <a href="list%20of%20rivers%20of%20Alberta">rivers</a> and <a href="list%20of%20lakes%20in%20Alberta">lakes</a> used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports. There are three large lakes, <a href="Lake%20Claire%20%28Albertan%20lake%29">Lake Claire</a> () in <a href="Wood%20Buffalo%20National%20Park">Wood Buffalo National Park</a>, <a href="Lesser%20Slave%20Lake">Lesser Slave Lake</a> (), and <a href="Lake%20Athabasca">Lake Athabasca</a> () which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the <a href="Athabasca%20River">Athabasca River</a> which travels from the <a href="Columbia%20Icefield">Columbia Icefield</a> in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca. The largest river is the <a href="Peace%20River%20%28Canada%29">Peace River</a> with an average flow of 2161 m/s. The <a href="Peace%20River%20%28Canada%29">Peace River</a> originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the <a href="Slave%20River">Slave River</a>, a tributary of the <a href="Mackenzie%20River">Mackenzie River</a>.

Alberta's capital city, <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity. <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> is located approximately south of Edmonton and north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the <a href="Calgary%E2%80%93Edmonton%20Corridor">Calgary‚ÄìEdmonton Corridor</a>. The land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years.

Most of the northern half of the province is <a href="boreal%20forest">boreal forest</a>, while the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see <a href="Alberta%20Mountain%20forests">Alberta Mountain forests</a> and <a href="Alberta-British%20Columbia%20foothills%20forests">Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests</a>). The southern quarter of the province is <a href="prairie">prairie</a>, ranging from <a href="shortgrass%20prairie">shortgrass prairie</a> in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central <a href="aspen%20parkland">aspen parkland</a> region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to <a href="Lloydminster">Lloydminster</a>, contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to <a href="dairy%20farming">dairy farming</a>, with <a href="mixed%20farming">mixed farming</a> more common in the north and centre, while <a href="ranching">ranching</a> and <a href="irrigated%20agriculture">irrigated agriculture</a> predominate in the south.

The Alberta <a href="badlands">badlands</a> are located in southeastern Alberta, where the <a href="Red%20Deer%20River">Red Deer River</a> crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. <a href="Dinosaur%20Provincial%20Park">Dinosaur Provincial Park</a>, near <a href="Brooks%2C%20Alberta">Brooks, Alberta</a>, showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.

Alberta has a <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a> with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from in northern Alberta to in southern Alberta, although temperatures at these extremes are rare. In the summer, continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from in the mountains to over in southeastern Alberta.

Alberta extends for over from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average high temperatures in January range from in the southwest to in the far north. The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the <a href="prevailing%20westerlies">prevailing westerly winds</a> and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from in the southeast to in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach annually. The province is the namesake of the <a href="Alberta%20clipper">Alberta clipper</a>, a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of Southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States.

In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north, up to around in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation, sometimes resulting in flooding.
Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 up to just under 2600 hours per year. Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.

In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at <a href="Pincher%20Creek">Pincher Creek</a>, temperatures soared from in just one hour. The region around <a href="Lethbridge">Lethbridge</a> has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year. Calgary has a 56% chance of a <a href="white%20Christmas%20%28weather%29">white Christmas</a>, while Edmonton has an 86% chance.

Northern Alberta is mostly covered by <a href="taiga">boreal forest</a> and has a <a href="subarctic%20climate">subarctic climate</a>. The agricultural area of southern Alberta has a <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid</a> <a href="steppe">steppe</a> climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that <a href="evapotranspiration">evaporates or is used by plants</a>. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the <a href="Palliser%20Triangle">Palliser Triangle</a>, experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent <a href="crop%20yield">crop yield</a> problems and occasional severe droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter <a href="chinook%20wind">chinook wind</a>s. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a <a href="biome">biome</a> transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north.

After Saskatchewan, Alberta experiences the most <a href="tornadoes">tornadoes</a> in Canada with an average of 15 verified per year. Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the <a href="Calgary%E2%80%93Edmonton%20Corridor">Calgary‚ÄìEdmonton Corridor</a> is notable for having the highest frequency of <a href="hail">hail</a> in Canada, which is caused by <a href="orographic%20lifting">orographic lifting</a> from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus <a href="anemone">anemone</a>; this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as March, though April is the usual month for the general population. Other prairie flora known to flower early are the <a href="golden%20bean">golden bean</a> and <a href="Rosa%20acicularis">wild rose</a>. Members of the <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a> family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between July and September. The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by short prairie grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower, <a href="fleabane">fleabane</a>, and <a href="Sagebrush">sage</a>. Both yellow and white <a href="sweet%20clover">sweet clover</a> can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province.

The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a>, typically <a href="aspen">aspen</a>, <a href="Populus">poplar</a>, and <a href="willow">willow</a>. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres. <a href="aspen">Aspen poplar</a>, <a href="balsam%20poplar">balsam poplar</a> (or in some parts <a href="Populus%20deltoides">cottonwood</a>), and <a href="paper%20birch">paper birch</a> are the primary large deciduous species. <a href="Conifer">Conifer</a>s include <a href="jack%20pine">jack pine</a>, Rocky Mountain pine, <a href="lodgepole%20pine">lodgepole pine</a>, both white and black <a href="spruce">spruce</a>, and the deciduous conifer <a href="tamarack">tamarack</a>.

The four climatic regions (<a href="alpine%20climate">alpine</a>, <a href="boreal%20forest">boreal forest</a>, <a href="Aspen%20parkland">parkland</a>, and <a href="prairie">prairie</a>) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the <a href="American%20bison">bison</a>, commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

Alberta is home to many large <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s. Among them are the <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly</a> and <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bears</a>, which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the <a href="canidae">canine</a> and <a href="Felidae">feline</a> families include <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s, <a href="wolf">wolves</a>, fox, <a href="lynx">lynx</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a> and <a href="mountain%20lion">mountain lion</a> (cougar).

<a href="Herbivore">Herbivorous</a> animals are found throughout the province. <a href="Moose">Moose</a>, <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a>, <a href="elk">elk</a>, and <a href="white-tail%20deer">white-tail deer</a> are found in the wooded regions, and <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a> can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. <a href="Bighorn%20sheep">Bighorn sheep</a> and <a href="mountain%20goat">mountain goat</a>s live in the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. Rabbits, <a href="porcupine">porcupine</a>s, <a href="skunk">skunk</a>s, <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie <a href="rattlesnake">rattlesnake</a>.

Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of <a href="duck">duck</a>s, <a href="goose">geese</a>, <a href="swan">swan</a>s and <a href="pelican">pelican</a>s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. <a href="Eagle">Eagle</a>s, <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, <a href="owl">owl</a>s and <a href="crow">crow</a>s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other <a href="temperate">temperate</a> regions, is home to <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es, <a href="fly">flies</a>, <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with <a href="pike%20%28fish%29">pike</a>, <a href="walleye">walleye</a>, <a href="Freshwater%20whitefish">whitefish</a>, <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow</a>, <a href="Brook%20trout">speckled</a>, <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a>, and <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>. <a href="Bull%20trout">Bull trout</a>, native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s are a few of the <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s that make their homes in Alberta.

Alberta is the only province in Canada‚Äîas well as one of the few places in the world‚Äîthat is free of <a href="brown%20rat">Norwegian rat</a>s. Since the early 1950s, the <a href="Government%20of%20Alberta">Government of Alberta</a> has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions. In 2009, several rats were
found and captured, in small pockets in southern Alberta, putting Alberta's rat-free status in jeopardy. A colony of rats were subsequently found in a landfill near Medicine Hat in 2012, and again in 2014.

Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> dinosaur fossils in the world. <a href="Taxon">Taxa</a> are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even <a href="Bone%20bed">mass graves</a>. At least 38 dinosaur <a href="type%20specimens">type specimens</a> were collected in the <a href="Canadian%20province">province</a>. The <a href="Foremost%20Formation">Foremost Formation</a>, <a href="Oldman%20Formation">Oldman Formation</a> and <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a>s collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur-bearing strata in Alberta.

Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta. The <a href="Dinosaur%20Provincial%20Park">Dinosaur Provincial Park</a> area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation. In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent <a href="Scollard%20Formation">Scollard Formation</a> outcrops. In the Drumheller Valley and <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> regions there are exposed <a href="Horseshoe%20Canyon%20Formation">Horseshoe Canyon</a> <a href="facies">facies</a>. Other <a href="Geologic%20formation">formations</a> have been recorded as well, like the <a href="Milk%20River%20Formation">Milk River</a> and Foremost Formations. However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops. Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites. Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the <a href="Belly%20River%20Group">Belly River Group</a> and <a href="St.%20Mary%20River%20Formation">St. Mary River Formation</a>s of the southwest and the northwestern <a href="Wapiti%20Formation">Wapiti Formation</a>. The Wapiti Formation contains two "<a href="Pachyrhinosaurus">Pachyrhinosaurus</a>" bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however. The <a href="Bearpaw%20Formation">Bearpaw Formation</a> represents strata deposited during a <a href="marine%20transgression">marine transgression</a>. Dinosaurs are known from this Formation, but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s.

<a href="Paleo-Indians">Paleo-Indians</a> arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a>. They are thought to have migrated from <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> on a <a href="Beringia">land bridge</a> across the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a> and then possibly moved down the east side of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> through Alberta to <a href="Settlement%20of%20the%20Americas">settle the Americas</a>. Others may have <a href="Coastal%20Migration%23Coastal%20migration%20hypothesis%20in%20the%20New%20World">migrated down the coast</a> of British Columbia and then moved inland. Over time they differentiated into various <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> peoples, including the <a href="Plains%20Indian">Plains Indian</a> tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the <a href="Blackfoot%20Confederacy">Blackfoot Confederacy</a> and the <a href="Plains%20Cree">Plains Cree</a>, who generally lived by hunting buffalo (<a href="American%20bison">American bison</a>), and the more northerly tribes such as the <a href="Woodland%20Cree">Woodland Cree</a> and <a href="Chipewyan">Chipewyan</a> who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.

After the <a href="British%20America">British arrival in Canada</a>, approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the <a href="Athabasca%20River">Athabasca River</a> drainage, became part of <a href="Rupert%27s%20Land">Rupert's Land</a> which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a>. This area was granted by <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II of England</a> to the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it. After the arrival of <a href="French%20Canadian">French Canadian</a>s in the west around 1731, they settled near fur trading posts, establishing communities such as <a href="Lac%20La%20Biche%2C%20Alberta">Lac La Biche</a> and <a href="Bonnyville%2C%20Alberta">Bonnyville</a>. Fort La Jonqui√®re was established near what is now Calgary in 1752.

The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was <a href="Peter%20Pond">Peter Pond</a>, who learned of the <a href="Methye%20Portage">Methye Portage</a>, which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land. Fur traders formed the <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a> (NWC) of <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on <a href="Lac%20la%20Biche%20%28Alberta%29">Lac la Biche</a> in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built <a href="Fort%20Chipewyan">Fort Chipewyan</a> on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir <a href="Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28explorer%29">Alexander Mackenzie</a>, followed the <a href="North%20Saskatchewan%20River">North Saskatchewan River</a> to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name‚Äîthe <a href="Mackenzie%20River">Mackenzie River</a>‚Äîwhich he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the <a href="Peace%20River%20%28Canada%29">Peace River</a> upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.

The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">sold to the United States</a> in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">Forty-Ninth Parallel</a> was ceded to Great Britain.

Fur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities. The amalgamated Hudson's Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870, when the newly formed <a href="Canadian%20Government">Canadian Government</a> purchased Rupert's Land. Northern Alberta was included in the <a href="North-Western%20Territory">North-Western Territory</a> until 1870, when it and Rupert's land became Canada's <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a>.

The <a href="District%20of%20Alberta">District of Alberta</a> was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the District of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of <a href="Alexander%20Cameron%20Rutherford">Alexander Cameron Rutherford</a> as the first premier.

On June 21, 2013, during the <a href="2013%20Alberta%20floods">2013 Alberta floods</a> Alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the <a href="Bow%20River">Bow</a>, <a href="Elbow%20River">Elbow</a>, <a href="Highwood%20River">Highwood</a> and <a href="Oldman%20River">Oldman</a> rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities in Southern Alberta declared local states of emergency on June 21 as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders.

In 2016, a <a href="2016%20Fort%20McMurray%20wildfire">wildfire</a> resulted in the largest evacuation of residents in Alberta's history, as more than 80,000 people were ordered to evacuate.

The <a href="Canada%202016%20Census">2016 census</a> reported Alberta had a population of 4,067,175 living in 1,527,678 of its 1,654,129 total dwellings, an 11.6% change from its 2011 population of 3,645,257. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. <a href="Statistics%20Canada">Statistics Canada</a> estimated the province to have a population of 4,280,127 in Q1 of 2017.

Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces.

About 81% of the population lives in urban areas and only about 19% in rural areas. The <a href="Calgary%E2%80%93Edmonton%20Corridor">Calgary‚ÄìEdmonton Corridor</a> is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada. Many of Alberta's cities and towns have experienced very high rates of growth in recent history. Alberta's population rose from 73,022 in 1901 to 3,290,350 according to the <a href="Canada%202006%20Census">2006 census</a>.
The 2006 census found that English, with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the population. The next most common mother tongues were <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a> with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by German with 84,505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61,225 (1.90%).

Other mother tongues include: <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a>, with 36,320 native speakers (1.13%); <a href="Tagalog%20language">Tagalog</a>, with 29,740 (0.92%); <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a>, with 29,455 (0.91%); Spanish, with 29,125 (0.90%); <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, with 21,990 (0.68%); <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, with 20,495 (0.64%); <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, with 19,980 (0.62%); and <a href="Vietnamese%20language">Vietnamese</a>, with 19,350 (0.60%). The most common aboriginal language is <a href="Cree%20language">Cree</a> 17,215 (0.53%). Other common mother tongues include Italian with 13,095 speakers (0.41%); <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> with 11,275 (0.35%); and <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a> with 10,845 (0.33%); then <a href="Standard%20Hindi">Hindi</a> 8,985 (0.28%); <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> 7,700 (0.24%); <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> 7,205 (0.22%); and <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a> 6,770 (0.21%).

Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from <a href="English%20Canadian">England</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Canadian">Scotland</a>, <a href="Irish%20Canadian">Ireland</a>, <a href="Canadians%20of%20Welsh%20descent">Wales</a> and <a href="French%20Canadian">France</a>, but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe, notably <a href="German%20Canadian">Germany</a>, <a href="Ukrainian%20Canadian">Ukraine</a> and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of <a href="Francophones">Francophones</a> in western Canada (after <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of <a href="Franco-Albertan">Alberta's French-speaking residents</a> live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.

As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic <a href="Chinatown">Chinatown</a>s, and Calgary has Canada's third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Alberta">Aboriginal Albertans</a> make up approximately three percent of the population.

In the 2006 <a href="Census%20in%20Canada">Canadian census</a>, the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 <a href="English-Canadian">English</a> (27.2%); 679,705 <a href="German-Canadian">German</a> (20.9%); 667,405 Canadian (20.5%); 661,265 <a href="Scottish%20Canadian">Scottish</a> (20.3%); 539,160 <a href="Irish%20Canadian">Irish</a> (16.6%); 388,210 <a href="French%20Canadian">French</a> (11.9%); 332,180 <a href="Ukrainian%20Canadian">Ukrainian</a> (10.2%); 172,910 <a href="Canadians%20of%20Dutch%20descent">Dutch</a> (5.3%); 170,935 <a href="Polish%20Canadians">Polish</a> (5.2%); 169,355 <a href="North%20American%20Indian">North American Indian</a> (5.2%); 144,585 <a href="Norwegian%20people">Norwegian</a> (4.4%); and 137,600 <a href="Chinese%20Canadian">Chinese</a> (4.2%). (Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable.)"

Amongst those of British origins, the <a href="Scottish%20Canadian">Scots</a> have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, <a href="Airdrie%2C%20Alberta">Airdrie</a>, <a href="Canmore%2C%20Alberta">Canmore</a>, and <a href="Banff%2C%20Alberta">Banff</a> having <a href="Scottish%20place%20names%20in%20Canada">Scottish</a> origins.

Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of <a href="visible%20minorities">visible minorities</a> after British Columbia and <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> with 13.9% of the population consisting of <a href="visible%20minorities">visible minorities</a>. Nearly one-fourth of the populations of <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> and <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> belong to a visible minority group.

Aboriginal Identity Peoples make up 5.8% of the population, about half of whom consist of <a href="North%20American%20Indians">North American Indians</a> and the other half are <a href="M%C3%A9tis%20people%20%28Canada%29">Metis</a>. There are also small number of <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> people in Alberta. The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.

As of the <a href="Canada%202011%20Census">2011 National Household Survey</a>, the largest religious group was Roman Catholic, representing 24.3% of the population. Alberta had the second highest percentage of <a href="non-religious">non-religious</a> residents among the provinces (after British Columbia) at 31.6% of the population. Of the remainder, 7.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Canada">United Church of Canada</a>, while 3.9% were <a href="Anglican%20Church%20in%20Canada">Anglican</a>. <a href="Lutherans">Lutherans</a> made up 3.3% of the population while <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a> comprised 1.9%.
The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. Members of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">LDS Church</a> are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province. Alberta has a population of <a href="Hutterite">Hutterite</a>s, a communal <a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> sect similar to the <a href="Mennonites">Mennonites</a>, and has a significant population of <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a>. Alberta is home to several <a href="Byzantine%20Rite">Byzantine Rite</a> Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the <a href="Ukrainian%20Catholic%20Eparchy%20of%20Edmonton">Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton</a>, and the <a href="Ukrainian%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Canada">Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada</a>'s <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Edmonton%20and%20Western%20Canada">Western Diocese</a> which is based in Edmonton.

<a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s, <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a>s, <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>s, and <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>s live in Alberta. Muslims made up 3.2% of the population, Sikhs 1.5%, Buddhists 1.2%, and Hindus 1.0%. Many of these are recent immigrants, but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies. Canada's oldest mosque, the <a href="Al-Rashid%20Mosque">Al-Rashid Mosque</a>, is located in Edmonton, whereas Calgary is home to Canada's largest mosque, the <a href="Baitun%20Nur">Baitun Nur</a> mosque. Alberta is also home to a growing <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> population of about 15,400 people who constituted 0.3% of Alberta's population. Most of Alberta's Jews live in the metropolitan areas of Calgary (8,200) and Edmonton (5,500).


Alberta's economy was one of the strongest in the world, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. In 2013 Alberta's per capita GDP exceeded that of the United States, Norway, or Switzerland, and was the highest of any province in Canada at <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>84,390. This was 56% higher than the national average of <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>53,870 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in <a href="History%20of%20Canada">Canadian history</a>. According to the 2006 census, the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole).

Alberta's <a href="debt-to-GDP%20ratio">debt-to-GDP ratio</a> is projected to reach 11.4% in <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> 2019-2020, compared to a surplus-to-GDP ratio of 13.4% in 2009-2010.

The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population). It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by <a href="TD%20Bank%20Financial%20Group">TD Bank Financial Group</a> found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a US level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a>, offering <a href="universal%20health%20care">universal health care</a> benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average US metropolitan areas and 40% above other <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Canada">Canadian cities</a> at that time.

The <a href="Fraser%20Institute">Fraser Institute</a> states that Alberta also has very high levels of <a href="economic%20freedom">economic freedom</a> and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada, and the second freest economy amongst US states and Canadian provinces. The government of Alberta has invested its earnings wisely; as of September 30, 2013, official statistics reported nearly 500 holdings.

In 2014, Merchandise exports totalled US$121.4 Billion. Energy revenues totalled $111.7 Billion and Energy resource exports totalled $90.8 Billion. Farm Cash receipts from agricultural products totalled $12.9 Billion. Shipments of forest products totalled $5.4 Billion while exports were $2.7 Billion. Manufacturing sales totaled $79.4 Billion, and Alberta's ICT industries generated over $13 Billion in revenue. In total, Alberta's 2014 GDP amassed $364.5 Billion in 2007 dollars, or $414.3 Billion in 2015 dollars. In 2015, Alberta's GDP grew despite low oil prices, however it was unstable with growth rates as high 4.4% and as low as 0.2%. Should the GDP remain at an average of 2.2% for the last two quarters of 2015, Alberta's GDP should exceed $430 Billion by the end of 2015. However, RBC Economics research predicts Alberta's real GDP growth to only average 0.6% for the last 2 quarters of 2015. This estimate predicts a real GDP growth of only 1.4% for 2015. A positive is the predicted 10.8% growth in Nominal GDP, and possibly above 11% in 2016.

Alberta is the largest producer of <a href="petroleum">conventional crude oil</a>, <a href="synthetic%20crude">synthetic crude</a>, natural gas and gas products in Canada. Alberta is the world‚Äôs second largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth largest producer. Two of the largest producers of <a href="petrochemicals">petrochemicals</a> in North America are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> and <a href="Polyvinyl%20chloride">vinyl</a> manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world. Edmonton's <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refineries</a> provide the raw materials for a large <a href="petrochemical">petrochemical</a> industry to the east of Edmonton.

The <a href="Athabasca%20oil%20sands">Athabasca oil sands</a> surrounding <a href="Fort%20McMurray">Fort McMurray</a> have estimated <a href="unconventional%20oil">unconventional oil</a> reserves approximately equal to the <a href="conventional%20oil">conventional oil</a> reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6¬†trillion barrels (254¬†km). Many companies employ both conventional <a href="surface%20mining">strip mining</a> and non-conventional <a href="in%20situ">in situ</a> methods to extract the <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a> from the <a href="oil%20sands">oil sands</a>. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil. The <a href="oil%20price%20increases%20since%202003">oil price increases since 2003</a> have made it profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss. By mid-2014 however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects. An example of this was the shelving of the Joslyn north project in the Athabasca region in May 2014.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive <a href="liquid-crystal%20display">liquid-crystal display</a> systems. With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of cattle, and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the top producers of plains <a href="American%20bison">buffalo (bison)</a> for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised.

Wheat and <a href="canola">canola</a> are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other <a href="cereal">grains</a> are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common <a href="grain%20elevator">grain elevator</a> is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading <a href="beekeeping">beekeeping</a> province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering <a href="Beehive%20%28beekeeping%29">hive</a>s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the <a href="Peace%20River%20%28Alberta%29">Peace River</a> valley where the season is short but the working days are long for <a href="Western%20honey%20bee">honeybee</a>s to produce honey from <a href="clover">clover</a> and <a href="fireweed">fireweed</a>. <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">Hybrid</a> canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.

Forestry plays a vital role in Alberta's economy, providing over 15,000 jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually. Uses for harvested timber include <a href="pulpwood">pulpwood</a>, <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>, <a href="engineered%20wood">engineered wood</a> and <a href="bioproducts">bioproducts</a> such as chemicals and <a href="biofuels">biofuels</a>. Recently, the United States has been Canada and Alberta's largest importer of <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a> and <a href="pulpwood">pulpwood</a>, although continued trades issues (<a href="Canada%E2%80%93United_States_softwood_lumber_dispute">Canada‚ÄìUnited_States_softwood_lumber_dispute</a>) with the U.S. have likely been a contributing factor towards Alberta's increased focus on Asian markets.

Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as <a href="West%20Edmonton%20Mall">West Edmonton Mall</a>, <a href="Calgary%20Stampede">Calgary Stampede</a>, outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the <a href="Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a> and Olympic Games, as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like <a href="Elk%20Island%20National%20Park">Elk Island National Park</a>, <a href="Wood%20Buffalo%20National%20Park">Wood Buffalo National Park</a>, and the <a href="Columbia%20Icefield">Columbia Icefield</a>.

According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. <a href="Banff%2C%20Alberta">Banff</a>, <a href="Jasper%2C%20Alberta">Jasper</a> and the <a href="Canadian%20Rockies">Rocky Mountains</a> are visited by about three million people per year. Alberta tourism relies heavily on <a href="Southern%20Ontario">Southern Ontario</a> tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the United States, and many other countries.

<a href="Alberta%27s%20Rockies">Alberta's Rockies</a> include well-known tourist destinations <a href="Banff%20National%20Park">Banff National Park</a> and <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a>. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic <a href="Icefields%20Parkway">Icefields Parkway</a>. Banff is located west of Calgary on <a href="Alberta%20Highway%201">Highway¬†1</a>, and Jasper is located west of Edmonton on <a href="Yellowhead%20Highway">Yellowhead Highway</a>. Five of Canada's fourteen <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20heritage%20site">World heritage site</a>s are located within the province: <a href="Canadian%20Rocky%20Mountain%20Parks">Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks</a>, <a href="Waterton-Glacier%20International%20Peace%20Park">Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park</a>, Wood Buffalo National Park, <a href="Dinosaur%20Provincial%20Park">Dinosaur Provincial Park</a> and <a href="Head-Smashed-In%20Buffalo%20Jump">Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump</a>.
About 1.2 million people visit the <a href="Calgary%20Stampede">Calgary Stampede</a>, a celebration of Canada's own <a href="Wild%20West">Wild West</a> and the cattle ranching industry. About 700,000 people enjoy Edmonton's <a href="K-Days">K-Days</a> (formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX). Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> <a href="Gold%20mining">gold field</a>s, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous <a href="Chilkoot%20Pass">Chilkoot Pass</a>.

Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. <a href="Drumheller">Drumheller</a>, "Dinosaur Capital of The World", offers the <a href="Royal%20Tyrrell%20Museum%20of%20Palaeontology">Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology</a>. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years.

Located in east-central Alberta is <a href="Alberta%20Prairie%20Railway%20Excursions">Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions</a>, a popular tourist attraction operated out of <a href="Stettler%2C%20Alberta">Stettler</a>, that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.

Alberta has numerous ski resorts most notably <a href="Sunshine%20Village">Sunshine Village</a>, <a href="Lake%20Louise%20Mountain%20Resort">Lake Louise</a>, <a href="Marmot%20Basin">Marmot Basin</a>, <a href="Mount%20Norquay%20ski%20resort">Norquay</a> and <a href="Nakiska">Nakiska</a>.

The Government of Alberta is organized as a <a href="parliamentary">parliamentary</a> democracy with a unicameral legislature. Its <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> legislature‚Äîthe <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly</a>‚Äîconsists of eighty-seven members elected <a href="First-past-the-post%20voting">first past the post</a> (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.

Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.

As Canada's <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth¬†II</a> is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor <a href="Lois%20Mitchell">Lois Mitchell</a>. The Queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and <a href="constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20custom%29">constitutional convention</a>. The lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the Queen. The government is headed by the <a href="Premier%20of%20Alberta">premier</a>. The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and draws all the members of the Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government‚Äîthe capital of Alberta.

The current premier is <a href="Rachel%20Notley">Rachel Notley</a>, sworn in on May¬†24, 2015.

The previous premier was <a href="Jim%20Prentice">Jim Prentice</a>, who became the leader of the then governing <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Progressive Conservatives</a> on September 6, 2014, following the resignation of <a href="Alison%20Redford">Alison Redford</a> and the interim leadership of <a href="Dave%20Hancock">Dave Hancock</a>. Prentice was sworn in as the 16th <a href="Premier%20of%20Alberta">Premier of Alberta</a> on September¬†15, 2014. He called an early election on May¬†5, 2015 in which the opposition <a href="Alberta%20New%20Democratic%20Party">New Democratic Party (NDP)</a> won a majority of the seats. Prentice immediately resigned his seat and leadership of the PC party, but remained premier until Notley was sworn in on May¬†24, 2015.

Alberta's elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other Canadian provinces. Since the 1960s, Alberta has had three main political parties, the Progressive Conservatives ("Conservatives" or "Tories"), the <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberals</a>, and the social democratic New Democrats. The <a href="Wildrose%20Party">Wildrose Party</a>, a more conservative party formed in early 2008, gained much support in <a href="2012%20Alberta%20General%20Election">2012 election</a> and became the <a href="official%20opposition">official opposition</a>, a role it still holds today. The strongly conservative <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Alberta">Social Credit Party</a> was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971.

For 44 years the Progressive Conservatives governed Alberta. They lost the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%202015">2015 election</a> to the NDP, signalling a possible shift to the left in the province, also indicated by the election of progressive mayors in both of Alberta's major cities. Since becoming a province in 1905, Alberta has seen only four changes of government - only five parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a>, from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015: and the currently governing Alberta New Democratic Party.

Alberta has had occasional surges in <a href="Alberta%20separatism">separatist sentiment</a>. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has not been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movement or referendum. Several groups are currently active promoting independence for Alberta in some form.

Government revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">federal government</a> primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%). Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a> (but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the <a href="Goods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28Canada%29">Goods and Services Tax</a> of 5%). It is also the only Canadian province to have a <a href="flat%20tax">flat tax</a> for personal income taxes, which is 10% of taxable income.

The Alberta personal income tax system maintains a <a href="progressive%20taxation">progressive character</a> by granting residents personal tax exemptions of $17,787, in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities, students, and the aged. Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in co-operation with the provincial government.

Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution. The privatization increased outlets from 304 stores to 1,726; 1,300 jobs to 4,000 jobs; and 3,325 products to 16,495 products. Tax revenue also increased from $400 million to $700 million.

Albertan municipalities raise a significant portion of their income through levying property taxes. The value of assessed property in Alberta was approximately $727 billion in 2011. Most real property is assessed according to its market value. The exceptions to market value assessment are farmland, railways, machinery & equipment and linear property, all of which is assessed by regulated rates. Depending on the property type, property owners may appeal a property assessment to their municipal 'Local Assessment Review Board', 'Composite Assessment Review Board,' or the Alberta Municipal Government Board.

Policing in the province of Alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the <a href="Royal%20Northwest%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Northwest Mounted Police</a>. In 1917, due to pressures of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War¬†I</a>, the <a href="Alberta%20Provincial%20Police">Alberta Provincial Police</a> was created. This organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> era cost cutting measure in 1932. It was at that time the now renamed <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> resumed policing of the province, specifically RCMP "K" Division. With the advent of the <a href="Alberta%20Sheriffs%20Branch">Alberta Sheriffs Branch</a>, the duties of law enforcement in Alberta has been evolving as certain aspects, such as traffic enforement, mobile surveillance and the close protection of the <a href="Premier%20of%20Alberta">Premier of Alberta</a> have been transferred to the Sheriffs. In 2006, Alberta formed the <a href="Alberta%20Law%20Enforcement%20Response%20Teams">Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams</a> (ALERT) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it. ALERT is made up of members of the RCMP, Sheriffs Branch and various major municipal police forces in Alberta.

Military bases in Alberta include <a href="CFB%20Cold%20Lake">Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Cold Lake</a>, <a href="CFB%20Edmonton">CFB Edmonton</a>, <a href="CFB%20Suffield">CFB Suffield</a> and <a href="CFB%20Wainwright">CFB Wainwright</a>. Air force units stationed at CFB Cold Lake have access to the <a href="Cold%20Lake%20Air%20Weapons%20Range">Cold Lake Air Weapons Range</a>. CFB Edmonton is the headquarters for the 3rd Canadian Division. CFB Suffield hosts British troops and is the largest training facility in Canada.

Alberta has over of highways and roads, of which nearly are paved. The main north-south <a href="wikt%3Acorridor">corridor</a> is <a href="Alberta%20Highway%202">Highway 2</a>, which begins south of <a href="Cardston%2C%20Alberta">Cardston</a> at the <a href="Carway%2C%20Alberta">Carway</a> border crossing and is part of the <a href="CANAMEX%20Corridor">CANAMEX Corridor</a>. <a href="Alberta%20Highway%204">Highway¬†4</a>, which effectively extends <a href="Interstate%2015">Interstate 15</a> into Alberta and is the busiest US gateway to the province, begins at the <a href="Coutts%2C%20Alberta">Coutts</a> border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. <a href="Alberta%20Highway%203">Highway¬†3</a> joins Lethbridge to <a href="Fort%20Macleod%2C%20Alberta">Fort Macleod</a> and links Highway¬†2 to Highway¬†4. Highway¬†2 travels north through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton.

North of Edmonton, the highway continues to <a href="Athabasca%2C%20Alberta">Athabasca</a>, then northwesterly along the south shore of <a href="Lesser%20Slave%20Lake">Lesser Slave Lake</a> into <a href="High%20Prairie">High Prairie</a>, north to <a href="Peace%20River%2C%20Alberta">Peace River</a>, west to <a href="Fairview%2C%20Alberta">Fairview</a> and finally south to <a href="Grande%20Prairie">Grande Prairie</a>, where it ends at an interchange with <a href="Alberta%20Highway%2043">Highway¬†43</a>. The section of Highway¬†2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the Queen Elizabeth¬†II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005. Highway¬†2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: <a href="Alberta%20Highway%2022">Highway 22</a>, west of Highway¬†2, known as "Cowboy Trail", and <a href="Alberta%20Highway%2021">Highway¬†21</a>, east of Highway¬†2. Highway¬†43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the <a href="Peace%20River%20Country">Peace River Country</a>; <a href="Alberta%20Highway%2063">Highway 63</a> travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the Athabasca oil sands.

Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the <a href="Trans-Canada%20Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a> system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the <a href="Yellowhead%20Highway">Yellowhead Highway</a> (<a href="Alberta%20Highway%2016">Highway¬†16</a>), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a> into British Columbia. One of the most scenic drives is along the <a href="Icefields%20Parkway">Icefields Parkway</a>, which runs for between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length. A third corridor stretches across southern Alberta; <a href="Alberta%20Highway%203">Highway¬†3</a> runs between Crowsnest Pass and Medicine Hat through Lethbridge and forms the eastern portion of the <a href="Crowsnest%20Highway">Crowsnest Highway</a>. Another major corridor through central Alberta is <a href="Alberta%20Highway%2011">Highway¬†11</a> (also known as the <a href="David%20Thompson%20%28explorer%29">David Thompson</a> Highway), which runs east from the <a href="Saskatchewan%20River%20Crossing%2C%20Alberta">Saskatchewan River Crossing</a> in Banff National Park through <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20House">Rocky Mountain House</a> and <a href="Red%20Deer%2C%20Alberta">Red Deer</a>, connecting with <a href="Alberta%20Highway%2012">Highway¬†12</a> west of <a href="Stettler%2C%20Alberta">Stettler</a>. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway¬†2 just west of Red Deer.

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and freeways are often called "trails". For example, Highway¬†2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called <a href="Deerfoot%20Trail">Deerfoot Trail</a> as it passes through Calgary but becomes <a href="Calgary%20Trail">Calgary Trail</a> (for southbound traffic) and <a href="Gateway%20Boulevard">Gateway Boulevard</a> (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of <a href="St.%20Albert%2C%20Alberta">St. Albert</a>. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban <a href="limited-access%20road">expressway</a>s "trails" and naming many of them after prominent <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> individuals and tribes, such as <a href="Crowchild%20Trail">Crowchild Trail</a>, Deerfoot Trail, and <a href="Stoney%20Trail">Stoney Trail</a>.

Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial <a href="public%20transit">public transit</a> systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate <a href="light%20rail%20transit">light rail transit</a> (LRT) systems. <a href="Edmonton%20LRT">Edmonton LRT</a>, which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the <a href="Central%20business%20district">CBD</a>, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary <a href="C-Train">C-Train</a> has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.

Alberta is well-connected by air, with <a href="international%20airport">international airport</a>s in both Calgary and Edmonton. <a href="Calgary%20International%20Airport">Calgary International Airport</a> and <a href="Edmonton%20International%20Airport">Edmonton International Airport</a> are the third and fifth <a href="List%20of%20the%20busiest%20airports%20in%20Canada">busiest in Canada</a> respectively. Calgary's airport is a hub for <a href="WestJet">WestJet Airlines</a> and a regional hub for <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a>. Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.

There are more than of operating mainline railway; the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> and <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> companies operate railway <a href="freight">freight</a> across the province. Passenger trains include <a href="Via%20Rail">Via Rail</a>'s Canadian (Toronto‚ÄìVancouver) or Jasper‚ÄìPrince Rupert trains, which use the CN mainline and pass through Jasper National Park and parallel the Yellowhead Highway during at least part of their routes. The <a href="Rocky%20Mountaineer">Rocky Mountaineer</a> operates two sections: one from Vancouver to Banff and Calgary over CP tracks, and a section that travels over CN tracks to Jasper.

Alberta provides a <a href="publicly%20funded%20health%20care">publicly funded health care</a> system, <a href="Alberta%20Health%20Services">Alberta Health Services</a>, for all its citizens and residents as set out by the provisions of the <a href="Canada%20Health%20Act">Canada Health Act</a> of 1984. Alberta became Canada's second province (after <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>) to adopt a <a href="Tommy%20Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a>-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern <a href="Medicare%20%28Canada%29">medicare</a> system.

Alberta's health care budget is currently $17.1¬†billion during the 2013‚Äì2014 fiscal year (approximately 45% of all government spending), making it the best funded health care system per-capita in Canada. Every hour more than $1.9 million is spent on health care in the province.
Notable health, education, research, and resources facilities in Alberta, all of which are located within Calgary or Edmonton:


The <a href="Edmonton%20Clinic">Edmonton Clinic</a> complex, completed in 2012, provides a similar research, education, and care environment as the <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> in the United States.

All public health care services funded by the Government of Alberta are delivered operationally by <a href="Alberta%20Health%20Services">Alberta Health Services</a>. AHS is the province's single health authority established on July 1, 2008, which replaced nine local health authorities. AHS also funds all ground ambulance services in the province, as well as the province-wide STARS (<a href="Shock%20Trauma%20Air%20Rescue%20Society">Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society</a>) air ambulance service.

As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).

There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one (<a href="St.%20Albert%2C%20Alberta">St.¬†Albert</a>) has a <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.

For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K‚Äì12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as a supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K‚Äì12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K‚Äì12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.

<a href="Public%20school%20%28government%20funded%29">Public</a> and separate school boards, <a href="charter%20school">charter school</a>s, and private schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Homeschool tutors may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies. Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.

The <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a>, located in Edmonton and established in 1908, is Alberta's oldest and largest university. The <a href="University%20of%20Calgary">University of Calgary</a>, once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. <a href="Athabasca%20University">Athabasca University</a>, which focuses on distance learning, and the <a href="University%20of%20Lethbridge">University of Lethbridge</a> are located in Athabasca and Lethbridge respectively.

In early September 2009, <a href="Mount%20Royal%20University">Mount Royal University</a> became Calgary's second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made <a href="MacEwan%20University">MacEwan University</a> Edmonton's second public university. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, <a href="Northern%20Alberta%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Northern Alberta Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="Southern%20Alberta%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Southern Alberta Institute of Technology</a>.

There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, mostly <a href="List%20of%20colleges%20in%20Alberta%23Private%20Colleges">Christian Universities</a>, bringing the total number of universities to twelve. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier <a href="Ralph%20Klein">Ralph Klein</a> made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.

Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton. The <a href="Edmonton%20Fringe%20Festival">Edmonton Fringe Festival</a> is the world's second largest after the <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a>. Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events, including folk music festivals. The city's "heritage days" festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups. Edmonton's <a href="Churchill%20Square%20%28Edmonton%29">Churchill Square</a> is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton & <a href="The%20Works%20Art%20%26amp%3B%20Design%20Festival">The Works Art & Design Festival</a> throughout the summer months.

The City of Calgary is also famous for its <a href="Calgary%20Stampede">Stampede</a>, dubbed "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth". The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as <a href="calf%20roping">calf roping</a> and <a href="bull%20riding">bull riding</a>. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts.

The <a href="Banff%20Centre">Banff Centre</a> hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international <a href="Banff%20Mountain%20Film%20Festival">Mountain Film Festival</a>. These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the <a href="Francis%20Winspear%20Centre%20for%20Music">Francis Winspear Centre for Music</a>. Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> and <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> teams. Soccer, <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> and <a href="lacrosse">lacrosse</a> are also played professionally in Alberta.

Alberta has relationships with several provinces, states, and other entities worldwide.

Actinopterygii

Actinopterygii , or the ray-finned fishes, constitute a <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">class</a> or subclass of the <a href="Osteichthyes">bony fishes</a>.

The ray-finned <a href="fish">fish</a>es are so called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines ("rays"), as opposed to the fleshy, lobed fins that characterize the class <a href="Sarcopterygii">Sarcopterygii</a> (lobe-finned fish). These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton (e.g., pelvic and pectoral girdles).

Numerically, actinopterygians are the dominant class of <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, comprising nearly 99% of the over 30,000 species of fish. They are ubiquitous throughout <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a> and <a href="ocean">marine</a> environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams. Extant species can range in size from "<a href="Paedocypris">Paedocypris</a>", at , to the massive <a href="ocean%20sunfish">ocean sunfish</a>, at , and the long-bodied <a href="oarfish">oarfish</a>, at .

Ray-finned fishes occur in many variant forms. The main features of a typical ray-finned fish are shown in the diagram at the left.

In nearly all ray-finned fish, the sexes are separate, and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid. Development then proceeds with a free-swimming larval stage. However other patterns of <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> exist, with one of the commonest being <a href="sequential%20hermaphroditism">sequential hermaphroditism</a>. In most cases this involves <a href="protogyny">protogyny</a>, fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage, triggered by some internal or external factor. This may be advantageous as females become less prolific as they age while male fecundity increases with age. <a href="Protandry">Protandry</a>, where a fish converts from male to female, is much less common than protogyny.
Most families use <a href="external%20fertilization">external</a> rather than <a href="internal%20fertilization">internal fertilization</a>. Of the <a href="oviparity">oviparous</a> teleosts, most (79%) do not provide parental care. <a href="vivipary">Viviparity</a>, <a href="ovoviviparity">ovoviviparity</a>, or some form of parental care for eggs, whether by the male, the female, or both parents is seen in a significant fraction (21%) of the 422 teleost families; no care is likely the ancestral condition. Viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about 6% of teleost species; male care is far more common than female care. Male territoriality <a href="exaptation">"preadapts"</a> a species for evolving male parental care.

There are a few examples of fish that self-fertilise. The <a href="mangrove%20rivulus">mangrove rivulus</a> is an amphibious, simultaneous hermaphrodite, producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation. This mode of reproduction may be related to the fish's habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits. Males are occasionally produced at temperatures below and can fertilise eggs that are then spawned by the female. This maintains genetic variability in a species that is otherwise highly inbred.

The earliest known fossil actinopterygiian is "<a href="Andreolepis%20hedei">Andreolepis hedei</a>", dating back 420 million years (<a href="Late%20Silurian">Late Silurian</a>). Remains have been found in <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>.

Actinopterygians are divided into the subclasses <a href="Chondrostei">Chondrostei</a> and <a href="Neopterygii">Neopterygii</a>. The <a href="Neopterygii">Neopterygii</a>, in turn, are divided into the infraclasses <a href="Holostei">Holostei</a> and <a href="Teleostei">Teleostei</a>. During the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> and <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> the teleosts in particular diversified widely, and as a result, 96% of all known fish species are teleosts. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the major groups of actinopterygians and their relationship to the terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) that evolved from a related group of fish. Approximate dates are from Near et al., 2012.

The polypterids (bichirs and ropefish) are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians, The Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) are the sister lineage of Neopterygii, and Holostei (bowfin and gars) are the sister lineage of teleosts. The <a href="Elopomorpha">Elopomorpha</a> (eels and tarpons) appears to be the most basic teleosts.

Albert Einstein

Albert Einstein (14 March 1879¬†‚Äì 18¬†April 1955) was a German-born <a href="theoretical%20physicist">theoretical physicist</a>. Einstein developed the <a href="theory%20of%20relativity">theory of relativity</a>, one of the two pillars of <a href="modern%20physics">modern physics</a> (alongside <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>). Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the <a href="philosophy%20of%20science">philosophy of science</a>. Einstein is best known by the general public for his <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass‚Äìenergy equivalence</a> formula (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"). He received the 1921 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the <a href="photoelectric%20effect">photoelectric effect</a>", a pivotal step in the evolution of <a href="Introduction%20to%20quantum%20mechanics">quantum theory</a>.

Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that <a href="Newtonian%20mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a> was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical mechanics</a> with the laws of the <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a>. This led him to develop his <a href="special%20theory%20of%20relativity">special theory of relativity</a> during his time at the <a href="Swiss%20Patent%20Office">Swiss Patent Office</a> in <a href="Bern">Bern</a> (1902‚Äì1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to <a href="gravitational%20fields">gravitational fields</a> and‚Äîwith his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916‚Äîhe published a paper on <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>. He continued to deal with problems of <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a> and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of <a href="particle">particle</a> theory and the <a href="Brownian%20motion">motion of molecules</a>. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the <a href="photon">photon</a> theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the <a href="universe">universe</a>.

Between 1895 and 1914, he lived in Switzerland (except for one year in Prague, 1911‚Äì12), where he received his academic diploma from the <a href="ETH%20Zurich">Swiss Federal Polytechnic</a> in Z√ºrich (later the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in 1900. He later taught there at the same institute as a professor of theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin. In 1901, after being stateless for more than five years, Einstein acquired <a href="Swiss%20citizenship">Swiss citizenship</a>, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the <a href="University%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich">University of Z√ºrich</a>. The same year, his "<a href="annus%20mirabilis">annus mirabilis</a>" (miracle year), he published <a href="Annus%20Mirabilis%20papers">four groundbreaking papers</a>, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.

He was visiting the United States when <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> came to power in 1933 and‚Äîbeing <a href="Jews">Jewish</a>‚Äîdid not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the <a href="Prussian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Berlin Academy of Sciences</a>. He settled in the United States, becoming an <a href="American%20citizen">American citizen</a> in 1940. On the eve of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, he endorsed a <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd%20letter">letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. This eventually led to what would become the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. Einstein supported defending the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied forces</a>, but generally denounced the idea of using the newly discovered <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> as a weapon. Later, with the British philosopher <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, Einstein signed the <a href="Russell%E2%80%93Einstein%20Manifesto">Russell‚ÄìEinstein Manifesto</a>, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. Einstein was affiliated with the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>, until his death in 1955.

Einstein published <a href="List%20of%20scientific%20publications%20by%20Albert%20Einstein">more than 300 scientific papers</a> along with over 150 non-scientific works. Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "<a href="genius">genius</a>".

Albert Einstein was born in <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a>, in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg</a> in the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, on 14¬†March 1879. His parents were <a href="Hermann%20Einstein">Hermann Einstein</a>, a salesman and engineer, and <a href="Pauline%20Koch">Pauline Koch</a>. In 1880, the family moved to <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded "Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie", a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a>.

The Einsteins were non-observant <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a>, and Albert attended a <a href="Catholic%20school">Catholic elementary school</a> in Munich from the age of 5 for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the <a href="Luitpold%20Gymnasium">Luitpold Gymnasium</a> (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> seven years later.

In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and a few months later to <a href="Pavia">Pavia</a>. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a>, but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict <a href="rote%20learning">rote learning</a>. At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note. During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the <a href="Aether%20theories">Ether</a> in a Magnetic Field".

In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the <a href="ETH%20Zurich">Swiss Federal Polytechnic</a> in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Z√ºrich</a> (later the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the <a href="Aargau">Argovian</a> <a href="Mittelschule">cantonal school</a> (<a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">gymnasium</a>) in <a href="Aarau">Aarau</a>, Switzerland, in 1895‚Äì96 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. (Albert's sister <a href="Maja%20Einstein">Maja</a> later married Winteler's son Paul.) In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his <a href="German%20citizenship">citizenship in the German Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg</a> to avoid <a href="Conscription%20in%20Germany">military service</a>. In September 1896, he passed the Swiss <a href="Matura">Matura</a> with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1‚Äì6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Z√ºrich Polytechnic. Marie Winteler, who was a year older moved to <a href="Olsberg%2C%20Aargau">Olsberg</a>, Switzerland, for a teaching post.

Einstein's future wife, <a href="Mileva%20Mari%C4%87">Mileva Mariƒá</a>, also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Mariƒá's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Z√ºrich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Mariƒá failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Mariƒá collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the <a href="Annus%20Mirabilis%20papers">"Annus Mirabilis" papers</a>, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.

The discovery and publication in 1987 of an early correspondence between Einstein and Mariƒá revealed that they had had a daughter, called <a href="Lieserl%20Einstein">"Lieserl"</a> in their letters, born in early 1902 in <a href="Novi%20Sad">Novi Sad</a> where Mariƒá was staying with her parents. Mariƒá returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. Einstein probably never saw his daughter. The contents of his letter to Mariƒá in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a> in infancy.
Einstein and Mariƒá married in January 1903. In May 1904, their first son, <a href="Hans%20Albert%20Einstein">Hans Albert Einstein</a>, was born in <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Their second son, <a href="Einstein%20family%23Eduard%20%26quot%3BTete%26quot%3B%20Einstein%20%28Albert%27s%20son%29">Eduard</a>, was born in Z√ºrich in July 1910. In April 1914 they moved to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. After a few months his wife returned to Z√ºrich with their sons, after learning that Einstein's chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin Elsa. They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. Eduard, whom his father called "Tete" (for "petit"), had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death.

In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still-strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be" while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie.

Einstein married <a href="Elsa%20Einstein">Elsa L√∂wenthal</a> in 1919, after having had a personal relationship with her since 1912. She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally. In 1933, they emigrated to the United States. In 1935, Elsa Einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems; she died in December 1936.

Among Einstein's well-known friends were <a href="Michele%20Besso">Michele Besso</a>, <a href="Paul%20Ehrenfest">Paul Ehrenfest</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Grossmann">Marcel Grossmann</a>, <a href="J%C3%A1nos%20Plesch">J√°nos Plesch</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Solovine">Maurice Solovine</a>, and <a href="Stephen%20Wise">Stephen Wise</a>.

After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> citizenship in February 1901, but was not <a href="conscription%20in%20Switzerland">conscripted</a> for medical reasons. With the help of <a href="Marcel%20Grossmann">Marcel Grossmann</a>'s father, he secured a job in <a href="Bern">Bern</a> at the <a href="Swiss%20Federal%20Institute%20of%20Intellectual%20Property">Federal Office for Intellectual Property</a>, the patent office, as an <a href="Patent%20examiner">assistant examiner ‚Äì level III</a>. 

Einstein evaluated <a href="patent%20application">patent application</a>s for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine technology". 

Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the <a href="thought%20experiment">thought experiment</a>s that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.

With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named "<a href="Olympia%20Academy">The Olympia Academy</a>", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Their readings included the works of <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincar√©</a>, <a href="Ernst%20Mach">Ernst Mach</a>, and <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.

In 1900, Einstein's paper <a href="List%20of%20scientific%20publications%20by%20Albert%20Einstein%23Journal%20articles">"Folgerungen aus den Capillarit√§tserscheinungen"</a> ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal "<a href="Annalen%20der%20Physik">Annalen der Physik</a>". On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis, with <a href="Alfred%20Kleiner">Alfred Kleiner</a>, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as "<a href="Pro%20forma">pro-forma</a>" advisor. As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the <a href="University%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich">University of Z√ºrich</a>, with his dissertation ""A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions"".

In that same year, which has been called Einstein's "<a href="annus%20mirabilis">annus mirabilis</a>" (miracle year), he published <a href="Annus%20Mirabilis%20papers">four groundbreaking papers</a>, on the photoelectric effect, <a href="Brownian%20motion">Brownian motion</a>, <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.

By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the <a href="University%20of%20Bern">University of Bern</a>. The following year, after giving a lecture on <a href="electrodynamics">electrodynamics</a> and the relativity principle at the University of Z√ºrich, <a href="Alfred%20Kleiner">Alfred Kleiner</a> recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.

Einstein became a full professor at the German <a href="Charles-Ferdinand%20University">Charles-Ferdinand University</a> in <a href="Prague">Prague</a> in April 1911, accepting <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n citizenship in the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Z√ºrich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the <a href="ETH%20Zurich">ETH Zurich</a>, where he taught analytical mechanics and <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>. He also studied <a href="continuum%20mechanics">continuum mechanics</a>, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend <a href="Marcel%20Grossmann">Marcel Grossmann</a>.

On 3 July 1913, he was voted for membership in the <a href="Prussian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Prussian Academy of Sciences</a> in Berlin. <a href="Max%20Planck">Max Planck</a> and <a href="Walther%20Nernst">Walther Nernst</a> visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Institute%20for%20Physics">Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics</a>, which was soon to be established. (Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">Humboldt University of Berlin</a>.) He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he accepted to move to the German Empire the next year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had developed a romantic affair. He joined the academy and thus the Berlin University on 1 April 1914. As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its Director. In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the <a href="German%20Physical%20Society">German Physical Society</a> (1916‚Äì1918).

Based on calculations Einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, <a href="Gravitational%20lens">light from another star should be bent</a> by the Sun's gravity. In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir <a href="Arthur%20Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> during the <a href="solar%20eclipse%20of%2029%20May%201919">solar eclipse of 29 May 1919</a>. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science¬†‚Äì New Theory of the Universe¬†‚Äì Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".

In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". While the <a href="General%20relativity">general theory of relativity</a> was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat the cited work as an "explanation" but merely as a "discovery of the law", as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the <a href="Planck%20spectrum">Planck spectrum</a> by <a href="S.%20N.%20Bose">S. N. Bose</a>. Einstein was elected a <a href="List%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20elected%20in%201921">Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921</a>. He also received the <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a> from the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in 1925.

Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor <a href="John%20Francis%20Hylan">John Francis Hylan</a>, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> and <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Science">National Academy of Science</a> on a visit to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher <a href="Viscount%20Haldane">Viscount Haldane</a> in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College London</a>. 

He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.," in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had <a href="Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a>, who published his own impressions in "<a href="Democracy%20in%20America">Democracy in America</a>" (1835). For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life . . . The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."

In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the <a href="Tokyo%20Imperial%20Palace">Imperial Palace</a>, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.

Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.

On his return voyage, he visited <a href="British%20Mandate%20for%20Palestine">Palestine</a> for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, <a href="Sir%20Herbert%20Samuel">Sir Herbert Samuel</a>. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.

Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met <a href="Santiago%20Ram%C3%B3n%20y%20Cajal">Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal</a> and also received a diploma from <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">King Alfonso XIII</a> naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences.

In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the U.S., he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.

After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including <a href="Chinatown%2C%20Manhattan">Chinatown</a>, a lunch with the editors of the "New York Times", and a performance of "Carmen" at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor <a href="Jimmy%20Walker">Jimmy Walker</a> and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind". <a href="Harry%20Emerson%20Fosdick">Harry Emerson Fosdick</a>, pastor at New York's <a href="Riverside%20Church">Riverside Church</a>, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> during a <a href="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> celebration.
Einstein next traveled to California, where he met <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a> president and Nobel laureate, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Millikan">Robert A. Millikan</a>. His friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism," where Einstein was a pronounced <a href="Pacifism">pacifist</a>. During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.

This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author <a href="Upton%20Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a> and film star <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, both noted for their pacifism. <a href="Carl%20Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a>, head of <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a>, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament," from which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy".

Chaplin's film, "<a href="City%20Lights">City Lights</a>", was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. <a href="Walter%20Isaacson">Walter Isaacson</a>, Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity". Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin, and recalled his "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was "possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis."

In February 1933 while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazis</a> under Germany's new chancellor, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.

While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> in Pasadena. He and his wife Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a <a href="Hitler%20Youth">Hitler Youth</a> camp.

In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian <a href="Gerald%20Holton">Gerald Holton</a> describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.

A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the <a href="German%20Student%20Union">German Student Union</a> in the <a href="Nazi%20book%20burnings">Nazi book burnings</a>, with Nazi propaganda minister <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> proclaiming, "Jewish intellectualism is dead." One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a>, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, "...¬†I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise." After moving to the U.S., he described the book burnings as a "spontaneous emotional outburst" by those who "shun popular enlightenment," and "more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence."
Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander <a href="Oliver%20Locker-Lampson">Oliver Locker-Lampson</a>, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the "Daily Herald" on 24 July 1933.

Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> at his home, and later, <a href="Austen%20Chamberlain">Austen Chamberlain</a> and former Prime Minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">Lloyd George</a>. Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian <a href="Martin%20Gilbert">Martin Gilbert</a> notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist <a href="Frederick%20Lindemann%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cherwell">Frederick Lindemann</a> to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities. Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">the Allies'</a> technology ahead of theirs.

Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>'s Prime Minister, <a href="%C4%B0smet%20%C4%B0n%C3%B6n%C3%BC">ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º</a>, to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved individuals".

Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In his speech he described Einstein as a "citizen of the world" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the U.K. Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Princeton <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a>, in the U.S., to become a resident scholar.

In October 1933 Einstein returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their <a href="Jewish%20quota">Jewish quota</a> which lasted until the late 1940s.

Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a> where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship, but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.

Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> and <a href="Kurt%20G%C3%B6del">Kurt G√∂del</a>) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with G√∂del. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. <a href="Bruria%20Kaufman">Bruria Kaufman</a>, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a <a href="unified%20field%20theory">unified field theory</a> and to refute the <a href="Copenhagen%20interpretation">accepted interpretation</a> of <a href="quantum%20physics">quantum physics</a>, both unsuccessfully.

In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included √©migr√© physicist <a href="Le%C3%B3%20Szil%C3%A1rd">Le√≥ Szil√°rd</a> attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szil√°rd, along with other refugees such as <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a>, "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the <a href="German%20nuclear%20energy%20project">race to build an atomic bomb</a>, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon." To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szil√°rd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd%20letter">a letter</a>, with Szil√°rd, to President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a>, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.

The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the <a href="Belgian%20Royal%20Family">Belgian Royal Family</a> and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. The U.S. became the only country to successfully develop nuclear weapons during World War II and also remains the only country to have used them in combat, <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">against Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> on 6 and 9 August 1945, respectively, towards the end of the war.

For Einstein, "war was a disease¬†... [and] he called for resistance to war." By signing the letter to Roosevelt, he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>, "I made one great mistake in my life‚Äîwhen I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification‚Äîthe danger that the Germans would make them¬†..."

Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the <a href="meritocracy">meritocracy</a> in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.

Einstein was a passionate, committed antiracist and joined <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the <a href="African-American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement%20%281896%E2%80%931954%29">civil rights</a> of African Americans. He considered racism America's "worst disease," seeing it as "handed down from one generation to the next". As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist <a href="W.%20E.%20B.%20Du%20Bois">W. E. B. Du Bois</a> and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.
In 1946 Einstein visited <a href="Lincoln%20University%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Lincoln University</a> in Pennsylvania, a <a href="historically%20black%20college">historically black college</a>, where he was awarded an honorary degree. (Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a>; alumni include <a href="Langston%20Hughes">Langston Hughes</a> and <a href="Thurgood%20Marshall">Thurgood Marshall</a>.) Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it." A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.

Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the <a href="Hebrew%20University%20of%20Jerusalem">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the <a href="World%20Zionist%20Organization">World Zionist Organization</a>, <a href="Chaim%20Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a>, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.

Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.

Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of <a href="Ezriel%20Carlebach">Ezriel Carlebach</a>, Prime Minister <a href="David%20Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a> offered Einstein the position of <a href="President%20of%20Israel">President of Israel</a>, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, <a href="Abba%20Eban">Abba Eban</a>, who explained that the offer "embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was "deeply moved", and "at once saddened and ashamed" that he could not accept it.

Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age, and later wrote: "If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music."

His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the <a href="violin">violin</a>, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into <a href="German%20culture">German culture</a>. According to conductor <a href="Leon%20Botstein">Leon Botstein</a>, Einstein is said to have begun playing when he was 5, although he did not enjoy it at that age.

When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of <a href="Mozart">Mozart</a>, whereupon "Einstein fell in love" with Mozart's music and studied music more willingly. He taught himself to play without "ever practicing systematically", he said, deciding that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty." At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played <a href="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="violin%20sonata">violin sonata</a>s, the examiner stating afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'." What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."

Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a> were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Z√ºrich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the <a href="K%C3%B6chel%20catalogue">K√∂chel catalogue</a> of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by <a href="Alfred%20Einstein">Alfred Einstein</a>, who may have been a distant relation.

In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the <a href="Zoellner%20Quartet">Zoellner Quartet</a>. Near the end of his life, when the young <a href="Juilliard%20Quartet">Juilliard Quartet</a> visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was "impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation".

Einstein's political view was in favor of <a href="socialism">socialism</a> and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as "<a href="Why%20Socialism%3F">Why Socialism?</a>". Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic <a href="World%20government">global government</a> that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation. The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.

Einstein spoke of his religious outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews. Einstein stated that he believed in the <a href="Pantheism">pantheistic</a> God of <a href="Spinozism">Baruch Spinoza</a>. He did not believe in a <a href="personal%20God">personal God</a> who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as na√Øve. He clarified however that, "I am not an atheist", preferring to call himself an <a href="Agnosticism">agnostic</a>, or a "deeply religious nonbeliever". When asked if he believed in an <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a>, Einstein replied, "No. And one life is enough for me."

On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced <a href="internal%20bleeding">internal bleeding</a> caused by the rupture of an <a href="abdominal%20aortic%20aneurysm">abdominal aortic aneurysm</a>, which had previously been reinforced surgically by <a href="Rudolph%20Nissen">Rudolph Nissen</a> in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.

Einstein refused surgery, saying: "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly." He died in <a href="Princeton%20Hospital">Princeton Hospital</a> early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.

During the autopsy, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, <a href="Thomas%20Stoltz%20Harvey">Thomas Stoltz Harvey</a>, removed <a href="Albert%20Einstein%27s%20brain">Einstein's brain</a> for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the <a href="neuroscience">neuroscience</a> of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so <a href="human%20intelligence">intelligent</a>. Einstein's remains were <a href="Cremation">cremated</a> and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.

In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965, at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: "He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness¬†... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn."

Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "<a href="genius">genius</a>". In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20statistics">Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics</a>, the <a href="Einstein%20refrigerator">Einstein refrigerator</a> and others.

The "Annus Mirabilis" papers are four articles pertaining to the <a href="photoelectric%20effect">photoelectric effect</a> (which gave rise to <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum theory</a>), <a href="Brownian%20motion">Brownian motion</a>, the <a href="special%20theory%20of%20relativity">special theory of relativity</a>, and <a href="Mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">E = mc</a> that Einstein published in the "Annalen der Physik" scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of <a href="History%20of%20physics%23Modern%20physics">modern physics</a> and changed views on <a href="space">space</a>, time, and <a href="matter">matter</a>. The four papers are:

Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to "Annalen der Physik" was on <a href="capillary%20attraction">capillary attraction</a>. It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillarit√§tserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902‚Äì1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret <a href="atom">atom</a>ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.

He articulated the <a href="principle%20of%20relativity">principle of relativity</a>. This was understood by <a href="Hermann%20Minkowski">Hermann Minkowski</a> to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the <a href="principle%20of%20equivalence">principle of equivalence</a>, <a href="general%20covariance">general covariance</a> and the principle of <a href="adiabatic%20invariant">adiabatic invariance</a> of the quantum number.

Einstein's ""Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K√∂rper"" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciles <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's equations</a> for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics, by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. This later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.

Consequences of this include the <a href="Spacetime">time‚Äìspace frame</a> of a moving body appearing to <a href="Time%20dilation">slow down</a> and <a href="Length%20contraction">contract</a> (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of a <a href="luminiferous%20aether">luminiferous aether</a>‚Äîone of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time‚Äîwas superfluous.

In his paper on <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass‚Äìenergy equivalence</a>, Einstein produced "E"¬†=¬†"mc" from his special relativity equations. Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with <a href="Max%20Planck">Max Planck</a>.

In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles ("<a href="quantum">quanta</a>"). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with <a href="Robert%20Millikan">Robert Millikan</a>'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of <a href="Compton%20scattering">Compton scattering</a>.

Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency "f" is associated with a collection of <a href="photon">photon</a>s with energy "hf" each, where "h" is <a href="Planck%27s%20constant">Planck's constant</a>. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.

In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently‚Äîa series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. <a href="Peter%20Debye">Peter Debye</a> refined this model.

Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the <a href="periodic%20table%20of%20the%20elements">periodic table of the elements</a>.

Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments <a href="Wilhelm%20Wien">Wilhelm Wien</a> had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of <a href="adiabatic%20invariant">adiabatic invariance</a> of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the <a href="blackbody%20radiation">blackbody curves</a> at different temperature to be derived from one another by a <a href="Wien%27s%20displacement%20law">simple shifting process</a>. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. <a href="Arnold%20Sommerfeld">Arnold Sommerfeld</a> identified this adiabatic invariant as the <a href="action-angle%20variables">action variable</a> of classical mechanics.

Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a "<a href="Privatdozent">Privatdozent</a>" at the University of Bern. In ""√úber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen √ºber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung"" (""), on the <a href="quantization%20%28physics%29">quantization</a> of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined <a href="momentum">momenta</a> and act in some respects as independent, <a href="point%20particle">point-like particles</a>. This paper introduced the "photon" concept (although the name "photon" was introduced later by <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Gilbert N. Lewis</a> in 1926) and inspired the notion of <a href="wave%E2%80%93particle%20duality">wave‚Äìparticle duality</a> in <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Einstein saw this wave‚Äìparticle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.

Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to <a href="Rayleigh%20scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a>, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his "second quantum theory". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant <a href="Otto%20Stern">Otto Stern</a>. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.

General relativity (GR) is a <a href="theory%20of%20gravitation">theory of gravitation</a> that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of <a href="spacetime">space and time</a> by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a>. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of <a href="black%20holes">black holes</a>, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.

As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that <a href="free%20fall">free fall</a> is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the <a href="equivalence%20principle">equivalence principle</a>. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of <a href="gravitational%20time%20dilation">gravitational time dilation</a>, <a href="gravitational%20red%20shift">gravitational red shift</a> and <a href="Gravitational%20lensing">deflection of light</a>.

In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity can for the first time be tested experimentally.

In 1916, Einstein predicted <a href="gravitational%20wave">gravitational wave</a>s, ripples in the <a href="curvature">curvature</a> of spacetime which propagate as <a href="wave">wave</a>s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its <a href="Lorentz%20invariance">Lorentz invariance</a> which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the <a href="Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">Newtonian theory of gravitation</a>, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.

The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting <a href="neutron%20stars">neutron stars</a>, <a href="PSR%20B1913%2B16">PSR B1913+16</a>. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at <a href="LIGO">LIGO</a> published the <a href="first%20observation%20of%20gravitational%20waves">first observation of gravitational waves</a>, on Earth, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.

While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the <a href="gauge%20invariance">gauge invariance</a> in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the <a href="hole%20argument">hole argument</a> was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.

In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a>, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of <a href="Mach%27s%20principle">Mach's principle</a> in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or <a href="Einstein%27s%20static%20universe">Einstein's static universe</a>. 

Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, <a href="The%20Friedmann-Einstein%20universe">The Friedmann-Einstein universe</a> of 1931 and the <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93de%20Sitter%20universe">Einstein‚Äìde Sitter universe</a> of 1932. In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was "in any case theoretically unsatisfactory".

In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder". The astrophysicist <a href="Mario%20Livio">Mario Livio</a> has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.

In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist <a href="Cormac%20O%27Raifeartaigh">Cormac O'Raifeartaigh</a> discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a <a href="Steady%20State%20theory">steady-state model</a> of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant. As he stated in the paper, "In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's ["sic"] facts, and in which the density is constant over time" ... "If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."

It thus appears that Einstein considered a <a href="Steady%20State%20theory">steady-state model</a> of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.

Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and quantum mechanics (a theory he had helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God "is not playing at dice." Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. 

In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in "Physikalische Zeitschrift" that proposed the possibility of <a href="stimulated%20emission">stimulated emission</a>, the physical process that makes possible the <a href="maser">maser</a> and the <a href="laser">laser</a>.
This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.

Einstein discovered <a href="Louis%20de%20Broglie">Louis de Broglie</a>'s work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for <a href="Matter%20wave">de Broglie waves</a>, which Einstein suggested was the <a href="Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi%20equation">Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation</a> of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schr√∂dinger's work of 1926.

In 1924, Einstein received a description of a <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical</a> model from Indian physicist <a href="Satyendra%20Nath%20Bose">Satyendra Nath Bose</a>, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the "<a href="Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Physik">Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik</a>". Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate</a> phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by <a href="Eric%20Allin%20Cornell">Eric Allin Cornell</a> and <a href="Carl%20Wieman">Carl Wieman</a> using <a href="ultracold%20atom">ultra-cooling</a> equipment built at the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">NIST</a>‚Äì<a href="JILA">JILA</a> laboratory at the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a>. Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of <a href="boson">boson</a>s. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.

General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a> allows these quantities to be determined from a <a href="Lagrangian%20%28field%20theory%29">Lagrangian</a> with <a href="Translational%20symmetry">translation invariance</a>, but <a href="general%20covariance">general covariance</a> makes translation invariance into something of a <a href="gauge%20symmetry">gauge symmetry</a>. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.

Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by <a href="Lev%20Landau">Lev Landau</a> and <a href="Evgeny%20Lifshitz">Evgeny Lifshitz</a>, and others, and has become standard.

The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schr√∂dinger</a> and others.

Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his "<a href="unified%20field%20theory">unified field theory</a>" in a "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>" article titled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation". Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the <a href="strong%20nuclear%20force">strong</a> and <a href="weak%20nuclear%20force">weak nuclear force</a>s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a <a href="theory%20of%20everything">theory of everything</a> and in particular <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a>, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.

In 1935, Einstein collaborated with <a href="Nathan%20Rosen">Nathan Rosen</a> to produce a model of a <a href="wormhole">wormhole</a>, often called <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Rosen%20bridges">Einstein‚ÄìRosen bridges</a>. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?". These solutions cut and pasted <a href="Schwarzschild%20black%20hole">Schwarzschild black hole</a>s to make a bridge between two patches.

If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.

In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the <a href="Torsion%20tensor">torsion</a>. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.

The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law‚Äîthe <a href="Einstein%20equations">Einstein equations</a> which describe how space curves, the <a href="geodesic%20equation">geodesic equation</a> which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.

Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.

This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by <a href="Roy%20Kerr">Roy Kerr</a> for spinning objects.

Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to <a href="force">force</a>, <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a>, and other research.

In addition to longtime collaborators <a href="Leopold%20Infeld">Leopold Infeld</a>, <a href="Nathan%20Rosen">Nathan Rosen</a>, <a href="Peter%20Bergmann">Peter Bergmann</a> and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.

Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a <a href="torsion%20pendulum">torsion pendulum</a>. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.

Einstein suggested to Erwin Schr√∂dinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">Bose‚ÄìEinstein gas</a> by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.

This formulation is a form of <a href="second%20quantization">second quantization</a>, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schr√∂dinger applied this to derive the <a href="thermodynamic">thermodynamic</a> properties of a <a href="Quantum%20chaos">semiclassical</a> <a href="ideal%20gas">ideal gas</a>. Schr√∂dinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.

In 1926, Einstein and his former student Le√≥ Szil√°rd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the <a href="Einstein%20refrigerator">Einstein refrigerator</a>. This <a href="absorption%20refrigerator">absorption refrigerator</a> was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. On 11 November 1930, was awarded to Einstein and Le√≥ Szil√°rd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company <a href="Electrolux">Electrolux</a>.

 The Bohr‚ÄìEinstein debates were a series of public disputes about <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> between Einstein and <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the <a href="philosophy%20of%20science">philosophy of science</a>. Their debates would influence later <a href="interpretations%20of%20quantum%20mechanics">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a>.

In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.

He then used a hypothesis of <a href="local%20realism">local realism</a> to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.

This principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the <a href="Aspect%20experiment">Aspect experiment</a> of 1982 confirmed <a href="Bell%27s%20theorem">Bell's theorem</a>, which had been promulgated in 1964.

While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to <a href="The%20Hebrew%20University">The Hebrew University</a>. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Einstein had expressed his interest in the <a href="plumbing">plumbing</a> profession and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union. Barbara Wolff, of <a href="The%20Hebrew%20University">The Hebrew University</a>'s <a href="Albert%20Einstein%20Archives">Albert Einstein Archives</a>, told the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.

<a href="Branded%20Entertainment%20Network">Corbis</a>, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.

In the period before World War II, "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."

Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of <a href="mad%20scientist">mad scientist</a>s and <a href="absent-minded%20professor">absent-minded professor</a>s; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".

Einstein received numerous awards and honors and in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by <a href="Alfred%20Nobel">Alfred Nobel</a>, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.

The land also served as the source from which the <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushans</a>, <a href="Hephthalite%20Empire">Hephthalites</a>, <a href="Samanid%20Empire">Samanids</a>, <a href="Saffarid%20Empire">Saffarids</a>, <a href="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a>, <a href="Ghorids">Ghorids</a>, <a href="Khalji%20dynasty">Khaljis</a>, <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughals</a>, <a href="Hotak%20Empire">Hotaks</a>, <a href="Durrani%20dynasty">Durranis</a>, and others have risen to form major empires.

The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a <a href="buffer%20state">buffer state</a> in the "<a href="The%20Great%20Game">Great Game</a>" between <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. Following the <a href="Third%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Third Anglo-Afghan War</a> in 1919, <a href="Amanullah%20Khan">King Amanullah</a> unsuccessfully attempted to modernize the country. Afghanistan remained peaceful during <a href="Mohammed%20Zahir%20Shah">Zahir Shah's</a> forty years of monarchy. A series of coups in the 1970s was followed by a <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%281978%E2%80%93present%29">series of civil wars</a> that devastated much of Afghanistan which began when the country <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Afghanistan">became a socialist state</a> under the influence of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> during the <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War</a>. Following the <a href="Soviet%20withdrawal%20from%20Afghanistan">departure of the Soviet forces</a>, the country became an <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Afghanistan">Islamic state</a> under the <a href="Peshawar%20Accord">Peshawar Accord</a> but much of its territory was then held by the <a href="Islamism">Islamic supremacist</a> group the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a>, who ruled the country as a <a href="Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">totalitarian regime for almost five years</a>. Following the 2001 <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the Taliban was <a href="Battle%20of%20Tora%20Bora">forcibly removed</a> by the <a href="NATO">NATO</a>-<a href="International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">led coalition</a>, Afghanistan's previous political structure was replaced with a more <a href="Western%20world">pro-Western</a>, democratically-elected government.

Afghanistan is a <a href="unitary%20state">unitary</a> <a href="presidential%20system">presidential</a> <a href="Islamic%20republic">Islamic republic</a> with <a href="Islam%20in%20Afghanistan">Islam</a> as an official <a href="state%20religion">state religion</a>.

The name "AfghƒÅnistƒÅn" (<a href="Pashto">Pashto</a> |ÿßŸÅÿ∫ÿßŸÜÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ) is believed to be as old as the <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> <a href="Afghan%20%28ethnonym%29">"Afghan"</a>, which is documented in the 10th-century <a href="geography">geography</a> book "<a href="Hudud%20ul-%27alam">Hudud ul-'alam</a>". The <a href="root%20%28linguistics%29">root</a> name "<a href="Afghan">Afghan</a>" was used <a href="history">historically</a> in reference to a member of the ethnic <a href="Pashtuns">Pashtuns</a>, and the <a href="suffix">suffix</a> "<a href="-stan">-stan</a>" means "place of" in <a href="Persian%20Language">Persian</a> and <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>. Therefore, Afghanistan translates to "land of the Afghans" or, more specifically in a historical sense, to "land of the Pashtuns". However, the modern <a href="Constitution%20of%20Afghanistan">Constitution of Afghanistan</a> states that "[t]he word Afghan shall apply to every <a href="Demographics%20of%20Afghanistan">citizen of Afghanistan</a>."

<a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">Excavations</a> of prehistoric sites by <a href="Louis%20Dupree%20%28professor%29">Louis Dupree</a> and others suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites.

The country sits at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the <a href="ancient%20Iranian%20peoples">ancient Iranian peoples</a> who established the dominant role of <a href="Indo-Iranian%20languages">Indo-Iranian languages</a> in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, the <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Macedonian Empire</a>, the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Indian Maurya Empire</a>, and the <a href="Islamic%20conquest%20of%20Afghanistan">Islamic Empire</a>.

Many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in Afghanistan, such as the <a href="Greco-Bactrian%20Kingdom">Greco-Bactrians</a>, <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushans</a>, <a href="Hephthalites">Hephthalites</a>, <a href="Kabul%20Shahi">Kabul Shahi</a>s, <a href="Saffarid%20Dynasty">Saffarids</a>, <a href="Samanids">Samanids</a>, <a href="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a>, <a href="Ghurid%20Dynasty">Ghurids</a>, <a href="Khalji%20dynasty">Khaljis</a>, <a href="Kartids">Kartids</a>, <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timurids</a>, <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughals</a>, and finally the <a href="Hotak%20dynasty">Hotak</a> and <a href="Durrani%20dynasty">Durrani</a> dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state.

<a href="Archaeology">Archaeological</a> exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a>, <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a>, <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>, <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze</a>, and <a href="Iron%20age">Iron age</a>s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of <a href="Mundigak">Mundigak</a> (near <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby <a href="Indus%20Valley%20Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a>. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilisation today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. In more detail, it extended from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the <a href="Oxus%20River">Oxus River</a> at <a href="Shortugai">Shortugai</a> in northern Afghanistan. There are several smaller IVC colonies to be found in Afghanistan as well.

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European-speaking</a> <a href="Indo-Iranians">Indo-Iranians</a>. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. The region at the time was referred to as <a href="Ariana">Ariana</a>.

The religion <a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder <a href="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a> is thought to have lived and died in <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a>. Ancient <a href="Iranian%20languages">Eastern Iranian languages</a> may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the <a href="Medes">Medes</a> and incorporated <a href="Arachosia">Arachosia</a>, <a href="Aria%20%28satrapy%29">Aria</a>, and <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a> within its eastern boundaries. An <a href="Epigraphy">inscription</a> on the tombstone of <a href="Darius%20I%20of%20Persia">Darius I of Persia</a> mentions the <a href="Kabulistan">Kabul Valley</a> in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.

<a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and his Macedonian forces arrived to Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating <a href="Darius%20III%20of%20Persia">Darius III of Persia</a> a year earlier in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaugamela">Battle of Gaugamela</a>. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a> controlled the region until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya Empire</a> as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Hindu Kush</a> until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after <a href="Ashoka">Ashoka</a>'s rule ended, leading to the <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic</a> reconquest by the <a href="Greco-Bactrians">Greco-Bactrians</a>. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the <a href="Indo-Greek%20Kingdom">Indo-Greek Kingdom</a>. They were defeated and expelled by the <a href="Indo-Scythians">Indo-Scythians</a> in the late 2nd century BCE.

During the first century BCE, the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a> subjugated the region, but lost it to their <a href="Indo-Parthian">Indo-Parthian</a> vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushan Empire</a>, centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanids</a> in the 3rd century CE, though the <a href="Indo-Sassanids">Indo-Sassanids</a> continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the <a href="Kidarite">Kidarite</a> who, in turn, were replaced by the <a href="Hephthalites">Hephthalites</a>. By the 6th century CE, the successors to the Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty called <a href="Kabul%20Shahi">Kabul Shahi</a>. Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by Buddhist culture.

<a href="Arab">Arab</a> <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s brought Islam to <a href="Herat">Herat</a> and <a href="Zaranj">Zaranj</a> in 642¬†CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. The land was collectively recognized by the Arabs as al-Hind due to its cultural connection with <a href="Greater%20India">Greater India</a>. Before Islam was introduced, people of the region were mostly Buddhists and Zoroastrians, but there were also <a href="Surya">Surya</a> and <a href="Nana%20%28Afghan%20goddess%29">Nana</a> worshipers, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Afghanistan">Jews</a>, and others. The <a href="Zunbils">Zunbils</a> and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870¬†CE by the <a href="Saffarid%20Dynasty">Saffarid</a> Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the <a href="Samanids">Samanids</a> extended their Islamic influence south of the <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> Kush. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still lived side by side in Kabul before the <a href="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a> rose to power in the 10th century.

By the 11th century, <a href="Mahmud%20of%20Ghazni">Mahmud of Ghazni</a> defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively <a href="Islamized">Islamized</a> the wider region, with the exception of <a href="Kafiristan">Kafiristan</a>. Afghanistan became one of the main centers in the <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim world</a> during this <a href="Islamic%20Golden%20Age">Islamic Golden Age</a>. The <a href="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavid dynasty</a> was overthrown by the <a href="Ghurid%20Dynasty">Ghurids</a>, who expanded and advanced the already powerful Islamic empire.

In 1219¬†AD, <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a> and his <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol</a> army overran the region. His troops are said to have annihilated the Khorasanian cities of Herat and Balkh as well as <a href="Bamyan%2C%20Afghanistan">Bamyan</a>. The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society. Mongol rule continued with the <a href="Ilkhanate">Ilkhanate</a> in the northwest while the <a href="Khalji%20dynasty">Khalji dynasty</a> administered the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of <a href="Timur">Timur</a>, who established the <a href="Timurid%20Empire">Timurid Empire</a> in 1370.

In the early 16th century, <a href="Babur">Babur</a> arrived from <a href="Fergana">Fergana</a> and captured Kabul from the <a href="Arghun%20dynasty">Arghun dynasty</a>. In 1526, he invaded <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi</a> in India to replace the <a href="Lodi%20dynasty">Lodi dynasty</a> with the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a>. Between the 16th and 18th century, the <a href="Khanate%20of%20Bukhara">Khanate of Bukhara</a>, <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavids</a>, and Mughals ruled parts of the territory. Before the 19th century, the northwestern area of Afghanistan was referred to by the regional name <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorasan</a>. Two of the four capitals of Khorasan (<a href="Herat">Herat</a> and <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a>) are now located in Afghanistan, while the regions of <a href="Kandahar%20Province">Kandahar</a>, <a href="Zabul%20Province">Zabulistan</a>, Ghazni, Kabulistan, and <a href="name%20of%20Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> formed the <a href="frontier">frontier</a> between Khorasan and <a href="Hindustan">Hindustan</a>.

In 1709, <a href="Mirwais%20Hotak">Mirwais Hotak</a>, a local <a href="Ghilji">Ghilzai</a> tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the Safavids. He defeated <a href="George%20XI%20of%20Kartli">Gurgin Khan</a> and made Afghanistan independent. Mirwais died of a natural cause in 1715 and was succeeded by his brother <a href="Abdul%20Aziz%20Hotak">Abdul Aziz</a>, who was soon killed by Mirwais' son <a href="Mahmud%20Hotak">Mahmud</a> for <a href="treason">treason</a>. Mahmud led the Afghan army in 1722 to the Persian capital of <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a>, captured the city after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gulnabad">Battle of Gulnabad</a> and proclaimed himself King of Persia. The Afghan dynasty was ousted from Persia by <a href="Nader%20Shah">Nader Shah</a> after the 1729 <a href="Battle%20of%20Damghan%20%281729%29">Battle of Damghan</a>.

In 1738, Nader Shah and his <a href="Afsharid%20dynasty">forces</a> captured Kandahar, the last Hotak stronghold, from Shah <a href="Hussain%20Hotak">Hussain Hotak</a>, at which point the incarcerated 16-year-old <a href="Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani">Ahmad Shah Durrani</a> was freed and made the commander of an Afghan regiment. Soon after the Persian and Afghan forces <a href="Nader%20Shah%27s%20invasion%20of%20India">invaded India</a>. By 1747, the <a href="Afghans">Afghans</a> chose Durrani as their <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>. Durrani and his Afghan army conquered much of present-day Afghanistan, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, the <a href="Khorasan%20Province">Khorasan</a> and <a href="Quhistan">Kohistan</a> provinces of Iran, and Delhi in India. He defeated the Indian <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha Empire</a>, and one of his biggest victories was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Panipat%20%281761%29">1761 Battle of Panipat</a>.

In October 1772, Durrani died of a natural cause and was buried at a site now adjacent to the <a href="Shrine%20of%20the%20Cloak">Shrine of the Cloak</a> in Kandahar. He was succeeded by his son, <a href="Timur%20Shah%20Durrani">Timur Shah</a>, who transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776. After Timur's death in 1793, the Durrani throne passed down to his son <a href="Zaman%20Shah%20Durrani">Zaman Shah</a>, followed by <a href="Mahmud%20Shah%20Durrani">Mahmud Shah</a>, <a href="Shuja%20Shah%20Durrani">Shuja Shah</a> and others.

The Afghan Empire was under threat in the early 19th century by the <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Persians</a> in the west and the <a href="Sikh%20Empire">Sikh Empire</a> in the east. Fateh Khan, leader of the <a href="Barakzai%20dynasty">Barakzai tribe</a>, had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. After his death, they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan had many temporary rulers until <a href="Dost%20Mohammad%20Khan">Dost Mohammad Khan</a> declared himself emir in 1826. The <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab region</a> was lost to <a href="Ranjit%20Singh">Ranjit Singh</a>, who invaded <a href="Khyber%20Pakhtunkhwa">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</a> and in 1834 captured the city of <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a>. In 1837, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jamrud">Battle of Jamrud</a> near the <a href="Khyber%20Pass">Khyber Pass</a>, <a href="Wazir%20Akbar%20Khan">Akbar Khan</a> and the Afghan army failed to capture the Jamrud fort from the <a href="Sikh%20Khalsa%20Army">Sikh Khalsa Army</a>, but killed Sikh Commander <a href="Hari%20Singh%20Nalwa">Hari Singh Nalwa</a>, thus ending the <a href="Afghan-Sikh%20Wars">Afghan-Sikh Wars</a>. By this time the British were advancing from the east and the <a href="First%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">first major conflict</a> during the "Great Game" was initiated.

In 1838, the British marched into Afghanistan and arrested <a href="Dost%20Mohammad%20Khan%20%28Emir%20of%20Afghanistan%29">Dost Mohammad</a>, sent him into exile in India and replaced him with the previous ruler, <a href="Shah%20Shujah%20Durrani">Shah Shuja</a>. Following an uprising, the <a href="1842%20retreat%20from%20Kabul">1842 retreat from Kabul</a> of British-Indian forces, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kabul%20%281842%29">Battle of Kabul</a> that led to its recapture, the British placed Dost Mohammad Khan back into power and withdrew their military forces from Afghanistan. In 1878, the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Second Anglo-Afghan War</a> was fought over perceived Russian influence, <a href="Abdur%20Rahman%20Khan">Abdur Rahman Khan</a> replaced <a href="Mohammad%20Ayub%20Khan%20%28Emir%20of%20Afghanistan%29">Ayub Khan</a>, and Britain gained control of Afghanistan's <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign relations</a> as part of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Gandamak">Treaty of Gandamak</a> of 1879. In 1893, <a href="Mortimer%20Durand">Mortimer Durand</a> made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic <a href="Pashtun%20people">Pashtun</a> and <a href="Baloch%20people">Baloch</a> territories were divided by the <a href="Durand%20Line">Durand Line</a>. This was a standard <a href="divide%20and%20rule">divide and rule</a> policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.

After the <a href="Third%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Third Anglo-Afghan War</a> and the signing of the <a href="Anglo-Afghan%20Treaty%20of%201919">Treaty of Rawalpindi</a> on 19 August 1919, King <a href="Am%C4%81null%C4%81h%20Kh%C4%81n">Amanullah Khan</a> declared Afghanistan a <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign</a> and fully <a href="independence">independent state</a>. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927‚Äì28 tour of Europe and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was <a href="Mahmud%20Tarzi">Mahmud Tarzi</a>, an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 <a href="constitution%20of%20Afghanistan">constitution</a>, which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of <a href="slavery">slavery</a> was abolished in 1923.

Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional <a href="burqa">burqa</a> for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by <a href="Habibullah%20Kalakani">Habibullah Kalakani</a>. Prince <a href="Mohammed%20Nadir%20Shah">Mohammed Nadir Shah</a>, Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by <a href="Abdul%20Khaliq%20Hazara%20%28assassin%29">Abdul Khaliq</a>, a fifteen-year-old <a href="Hazara%20people">Hazara</a> student.

<a href="Mohammed%20Zahir%20Shah">Mohammed Zahir Shah</a>, Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Afghanistan">Prime Minister</a> and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, <a href="Shah%20Mahmud%20Khan">Shah Mahmud Khan</a>, became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by <a href="Mohammed%20Daoud%20Khan">Mohammed Daoud Khan</a>, the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> nor aligned with either power bloc in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet <a href="development%20aid">development aid</a> than any other country. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first <a href="President%20of%20Afghanistan">President of Afghanistan</a>. In the meantime, <a href="Zulfikar%20Ali%20Bhutto">Zulfikar Ali Bhutto</a> got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan. Some experts suggest that Bhutto paved the way for the April 1978 <a href="Saur%20Revolution">Saur Revolution</a>.

In April 1978, the communist <a href="People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan</a> (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the <a href="Saur%20Revolution">Saur Revolution</a>. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%281978%E2%80%93present%29">civil war</a> waged by guerrilla <a href="mujahideen">mujahideen</a> against government forces countrywide. The Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government. Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA¬†‚Äî the dominant <a href="Khalq">Khalq</a> and the more moderate <a href="Parcham">Parcham</a>¬†‚Äî resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup.

In September 1979, <a href="Nur%20Muhammad%20Taraki">Nur Muhammad Taraki</a> was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member <a href="Hafizullah%20Amin">Hafizullah Amin</a>, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's <a href="Babrak%20Karmal">Babrak Karmal</a> but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan. The PDPA prohibited <a href="usury">usury</a>, declared equality of the sexes, and introduced women to political life.

The <a href="Operation%20Cyclone">United States</a> had been supporting anti-Soviet Afghan "<a href="mujahideen">mujahideen</a>" and foreign "<a href="Afghan%20Arab">Afghan Arab</a>" fighters through Pakistan's <a href="Inter-Services%20Intelligence">ISI</a> as early as mid-1979 (see "<a href="CIA%20activities%20in%20Afghanistan">CIA activities in Afghanistan</a>"). Billions in cash and weapons, which included over two thousand <a href="FIM-92%20Stinger">FIM-92 Stinger</a> <a href="surface-to-air%20missiles">surface-to-air missiles</a>, were provided by the United States and <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> to Pakistan.

During the <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet war in Afghanistan</a>, Soviet forces and their proxies killed between 562,000 and 2 million Afghans, and also displaced about 6 million people who subsequently fled Afghanistan, mainly to <a href="Afghans%20in%20Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Afghans%20in%20Iran">Iran</a>. Pakistan's <a href="Khyber%20Pakhtunkhwa">North-West Frontier Province</a> functioned as an organisational and networking base for the anti-Soviet Afghan resistance, with the province's influential <a href="Deobandi">Deobandi</a> ulama playing a major supporting role in promoting the 'jihad'. Faced with mounting international pressure and numerous casualties, the Soviets withdrew in 1989 but continued to support Afghan President <a href="Mohammad%20Najibullah">Mohammad Najibullah</a> until 1992.

From 1989 until 1992, Najibullah's government tried to solve the ongoing civil war with economic and military aid, but without Soviet troops on the ground. Pakistan's spy agency (<a href="Inter-Services%20Intelligence">ISI</a>), headed by <a href="Hamid%20Gul">Hamid Gul</a> at the time, was interested in a trans-national Islamic revolution which would cover Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. For this purpose Pakistan masterminded an attack on <a href="Jalalabad">Jalalabad</a> for the Mujahideen to establish their own government in Afghanistan. Najibullah tried to build support for his government by portraying his government as <a href="Islamism">Islamic</a>, and in the 1990 constitution the country officially became an <a href="Islamic%20state%20%28government%29">Islamic state</a> and all references of communism were removed. Nevertheless, Najibullah did not win any significant support, and with the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a> in December 1991, he was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government, led to his ousting from power in April 1992. After the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992, the post-communist <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Afghanistan">Islamic State of Afghanistan</a> was established by the <a href="Peshawar%20Accord">Peshawar Accord</a>, a peace and power-sharing agreement under which all the Afghan parties were united in April 1992, except for the Pakistani supported <a href="Hezb-e%20Islami">Hezb-e Islami</a> of <a href="Gulbuddin%20Hekmatyar">Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</a>. Hekmatyar started a bombardment campaign against the capital city Kabul, which marked the beginning of a <a href="Civil%20war%20in%20Afghanistan%20%281992%E2%80%9396%29">new phase in the war</a>.

Saudi Arabia and Iran supported different Afghan militias and instability quickly developed. The conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full-scale war.
Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units, and a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos. Because of the chaos, some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their (sub-)commanders. For civilians there was little security from murder, rape, and extortion. An estimated 25,000 people died during the most intense period of bombardment by Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami and the <a href="Junbish-i%20Milli">Junbish-i Milli</a> forces of <a href="Abdul%20Rashid%20Dostum">Abdul Rashid Dostum</a>, who had created an alliance with Hekmatyar in 1994. Half a million people fled Afghanistan.

Southern and eastern Afghanistan were under the control of local commanders such as <a href="Gul%20Agha%20Sherzai">Gul Agha Sherzai</a> and others. In 1994, the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> (a movement originating from <a href="Jamiat%20Ulema-e-Islam">Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam</a>-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a political-religious force. The Taliban first took control of southern Afghanistan in 1994 and forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders.

In late 1994, forces of <a href="Ahmad%20Shah%20Massoud">Ahmad Shah Massoud</a> held on to Kabul. Rabbani's government took steps to reopen courts, restore law and order, and initiate a nationwide <a href="political%20process">political process</a> with the goal of national <a href="Democratic%20consolidation">consolidation</a> and democratic elections. Massoud invited Taliban leaders to join the process but they refused.

The Taliban's early victories in late 1994 were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses. The Taliban attempted to capture Kabul in early 1995 but were repelled by forces under Massoud. In September 1996, as the Taliban, with military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul. The Taliban seized Kabul in the same month and established the <a href="Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</a>. They imposed a strict form of <a href="Sharia">Sharia</a>, similar to that found in Saudi Arabia. According to <a href="Physicians%20for%20Human%20Rights">Physicians for Human Rights</a> (PHR), "no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment from showing their faces, seeking medical care without a male escort, or attending school" (this statement, though, was made in 1998, long before the advent of <a href="ISIS">ISIS</a> which has imposed even tougher and more violent sharia controls).

<a href="Battle%20of%20Kabul%20%281992%E2%80%9396%29">After the fall of Kabul</a> to the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a>, Massoud and Dostum formed the <a href="Northern%20Alliance">Northern Alliance</a>. The Taliban defeated Dostum's forces during the <a href="Battles%20of%20Mazar-i-Sharif%20%281997%E2%80%9398%29">Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997‚Äì98)</a>. Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, <a href="Pervez%20Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a>, began sending thousands of Pakistanis to help the Taliban defeat the Northern Alliance.<ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph"></ref> From 1996 to 2001, the <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> network of <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> and <a href="Ayman%20al-Zawahiri">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a> was also operating inside Afghanistan. This and the fact that around one million Afghans were internally displaced made the United States worry. From 1990 to September 2001, around 400,000 Afghans died in the internal mini-wars.

On 9 September 2001, Massoud was assassinated by two Arab <a href="suicide%20attack">suicide attack</a>ers in <a href="Panjshir%20province">Panjshir province</a> of Afghanistan. Two days later, the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> were carried out in the United States. The US government suspected Osama bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks, and demanded that the Taliban hand him over. The Taliban offered to hand over Bin Laden to a third country for trial, not directly to the USA. Washington refused that offer. Instead, the US launched the October 2001 <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Operation Enduring Freedom</a>. The majority of Afghans supported the American invasion of their country. During the initial invasion, US and UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps. The United States began working with the Northern Alliance to remove the Taliban from power.

In December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the <a href="Afghan%20Interim%20Administration">Afghan Interim Administration</a> under <a href="Hamid%20Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> was formed, in which process the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> were typecast as 'the bad guys' and left out. The <a href="International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">International Security Assistance Force</a> (ISAF) was established by the <a href="UN%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a> to help assist the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Hamid%20Karzai">Karzai administration</a> and provide basic security. Taliban forces meanwhile began regrouping inside Pakistan, while more coalition troops entered Afghanistan and began rebuilding the war-torn country.

Shortly after their fall from power, the Taliban began an <a href="Taliban%20insurgency">insurgency</a> to regain control of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan troops</a> led many offensives against the Taliban, but failed to fully defeat them. Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world due to a lack of foreign investment, <a href="Corruption%20in%20Afghanistan">government corruption</a>, and the Taliban insurgency.

Meanwhile, the <a href="Politics%20of%20Afghanistan">Afghan government</a> was able to build some democratic structures, and the country changed its name to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture. ISAF forces also began to train the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Security%20Forces">Afghan National Security Forces</a>. In the decade following 2002, over five million <a href="Afghan%20diaspora">Afghans</a> were <a href="repatriation">repatriated</a>, including some who were forcefully <a href="deportation">deported</a> from Western countries.

By 2009, a Taliban-led shadow government began to form in parts of the country. In 2010, President Karzai attempted to hold <a href="Afghan%20Peace%20Jirga%202010">peace negotiations</a> with the Taliban leaders, but the rebel group refused to attend until mid-2015 when the Taliban supreme leader finally decided to back the peace talks.
After the May 2011 <a href="death%20of%20Osama%20bin%20Laden">death of Osama bin Laden</a> in Pakistan, many prominent Afghan figures were assassinated. <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Pakistan%20skirmishes">Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan border skirmishes</a> intensified and many large scale attacks by the Pakistan-based <a href="Haqqani%20Network">Haqqani Network</a> also took place across Afghanistan. The United States blamed rogue elements within the Pakistani government for the increased attacks. The U.S. government spent tens of billions of dollars on development aid over 15 years and over a trillion dollars on military expenses during the same period. Corruption by Western defense and development contractors and associated Afghans reached unprecedented levels in a country where the national GDP was often only a small fraction of the U.S. government's annual budget for the conflict.

Following the <a href="Afghan%20presidential%20election%2C%202014">2014 presidential election</a> President Karzai left power and <a href="Ashraf%20Ghani">Ashraf Ghani</a> became President in September 2014. The <a href="United%20States">United States'</a> war in Afghanistan - by then the longest in its history - officially ended on 28 December 2014. However, thousands of US-led NATO troops have remained in the country to train and advise Afghan government forces. The 2001‚Äìpresent war has resulted in over 90,000 direct war-related <a href="Civilian%20casualties%20in%20the%20war%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">deaths</a>, which includes insurgents, Afghan civilians and government forces. Over 100,000 have been injured.

A <a href="landlocked">landlocked</a> mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest, Afghanistan is located within South Asia and Central Asia. It is part of the US-coined <a href="Greater%20Middle%20East">Greater Middle East</a> <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim world</a>, which lies between <a href="latitude">latitude</a>s <a href="29th%20parallel%20north"></a> and <a href="39th%20parallel%20north"></a>, and <a href="longitude">longitude</a>s <a href="60th%20meridian%20east"></a> and <a href="75th%20meridian%20east"></a>. The country's highest point is <a href="Noshaq">Noshaq</a>, at above sea level. It has a <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a> with harsh winters in the <a href="Hazarajat">central highlands</a>, the glaciated northeast (around <a href="Nuristan">Nuristan</a>), and the <a href="Wakhan%20Corridor">Wakhan Corridor</a>, where the average temperature in January is below , and hot summers in the low-lying areas of the <a href="Sistan%20Basin">Sistan Basin</a> of the southwest, the <a href="Jalalabad">Jalalabad</a> basin in the east, and the <a href="Afghan%20Turkestan">Turkestan</a> plains along the <a href="Amu%20River">Amu River</a> in the north, where temperatures average over in July.

Despite having numerous rivers and <a href="list%20of%20dams%20and%20reservoirs%20in%20Afghanistan">reservoirs</a>, large parts of the country are dry. The <a href="endorheic%20basin">endorheic</a> Sistan Basin is one of the driest regions in the world. Aside from the usual rainfall, Afghanistan receives snow during the winter in the <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Hindu Kush</a> and <a href="Pamir%20Mountains">Pamir Mountains</a>, and the melting snow in the spring season enters the <a href="list%20of%20rivers%20of%20Afghanistan">rivers, lakes, and streams</a>. However, two-thirds of the country's water flows into the neighboring countries of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan. The state needs more than to rehabilitate its irrigation systems so that the water is properly managed.

The northeastern Hindu Kush <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a>, in and around the <a href="Badakhshan%20Province">Badakhshan Province</a> of Afghanistan, is in a <a href="natural%20environment%23Geological%20activity">geologically active</a> area where earthquakes may occur almost every year. They can be deadly and destructive sometimes, causing <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s in some parts or <a href="2009%20Afghan%20avalanches">avalanches</a> during the winter. The last strong earthquakes were in <a href="February%204%2C%201998%20Afghanistan%20earthquake">1998</a>, which killed about 6,000 people in Badakhshan near Tajikistan. This was followed by the <a href="2002%20Hindu%20Kush%20earthquakes">2002 Hindu Kush earthquakes</a> in which over 150 people were killed and over 1,000 injured. A <a href="2010%20Afghanistan%20earthquake">2010 earthquake</a> left 11 Afghans dead, over 70 injured, and more than 2,000 houses destroyed.

The country's natural resources include: <a href="coal">coal</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a>, <a href="lithium">lithium</a>, <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="rare%20earth%20element">rare earth element</a>s, <a href="chromite">chromite</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="talc">talc</a>, <a href="barites">barites</a>, <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, <a href="marble">marble</a>, precious and <a href="semi-precious%20stones">semi-precious stones</a>, <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>, and <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a>, among other things. In 2010, US and Afghan government officials estimated that untapped mineral deposits located in 2007 by the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">US Geological Survey</a> are worth at least .

At , Afghanistan is the world's <a href="List%20of%20countries%20and%20dependencies%20by%20area">41st largest country</a>, slightly bigger than France and smaller than Burma, about the size of Texas in the United States. It borders Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far east.

The <a href="population">population</a> of Afghanistan was estimated at 29.2 million in 2017. Of this, 15 million are males and 14.2 million females. About 22% of them are <a href="urban%20area">urbanite</a> and the remaining 78% live in rural areas. An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring <a href="Afghans%20in%20Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Afghans%20in%20Iran">Iran</a>, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries. This makes the total Afghan population at around 33,332,025, and its current growth rate is 2.34%. This population is expected to reach 82 million by 2050.

The only city with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul. Other <a href="list%20of%20cities%20in%20Afghanistan">large cities in the country</a> are, in order of population size, <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, <a href="Mazar-i-Sharif">Mazar-i-Sharif</a>, <a href="Kunduz">Kunduz</a>, <a href="Jalalabad">Jalalabad</a>, <a href="Lashkar%20Gah">Lashkar Gah</a>, <a href="Taloqan">Taloqan</a>, <a href="Khost">Khost</a>, <a href="Sheberghan">Sheberghan</a>, and <a href="Ghazni">Ghazni</a>.
Afghanistan's population is divided into several <a href="ethnolinguistics">ethnolinguistic</a> groups, which are listed in the chart below:

<a href="Pashto">Pashto</a> and <a href="Dari%20language">Dari</a> are the <a href="official%20language">official language</a>s of Afghanistan; <a href="bilingualism">bilingualism</a> is very common. Dari, which is Afghanistan's Persian, functions as the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> in Kabul as well as in much of the northern and northwestern parts of the country. Pashto is the native tongue of the Pashtuns, although many of them are also fluent in Dari while some non-Pashtuns are fluent in Pashto.

There are a number of smaller regional languages, they include <a href="Uzbek%20language">Uzbeki</a>, <a href="Turkmen%20language">Turkmeni</a>, <a href="Balochi%20language">Balochi</a>, <a href="Pashayi%20language">Pashayi</a>, and <a href="Nuristani%20languages">Nuristani</a>. A number of Afghans are also fluent in <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, English, and other foreign languages.

Over 99% of the Afghan population is Muslim. According to latest estimates, up to 90% practice <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a> and the remaining 7‚Äì15% adhere to <a href="Shia%20Islam%20in%20Afghanistan">Shia Islam</a>.

Thousands of Afghan <a href="Sikhism%20in%20Afghanistan">Sikhs</a> and <a href="Hinduism%20in%20Afghanistan">Hindus</a> are also found in the major cities. There was a small <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Afghanistan">Jewish community in Afghanistan</a> who had emigrated to <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and the United States by the end of the twentieth century; at least one Jew, <a href="Zablon%20Simintov">Zablon Simintov</a>, remained.

Afghanistan is an <a href="Islamic%20republic">Islamic republic</a> consisting of three branches, the executive, legislative, and judicial. The nation is led by President <a href="Ashraf%20Ghani">Ashraf Ghani</a> with <a href="Abdul%20Rashid%20Dostum">Abdul Rashid Dostum</a> and <a href="Sarwar%20Danish">Sarwar Danish</a> as vice presidents. <a href="Abdullah%20Abdullah">Abdullah Abdullah</a> serves as the chief executive officer (CEO). The <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Afghanistan">National Assembly</a> is the legislature, a <a href="bicameralism">bicameral</a> body having two chambers, the <a href="House%20of%20the%20People%20%28Afghanistan%29">House of the People</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Elders">House of Elders</a>. The <a href="Afghan%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a> is led by <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Afghanistan">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Said%20Yusuf%20Halem">Said Yusuf Halem</a>, the former Deputy Minister of Justice for Legal Affairs.

A January 2010 report published by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Office%20on%20Drugs%20and%20Crime">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a> revealed that bribery consumed an amount equal to 23% of the GDP of the nation. A number of <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20%28Afghanistan%29">government ministries</a> are believed to be rife with corruption, and while President Karzai vowed to tackle the problem in late 2009 by stating that "individuals who are involved in corruption will have no place in the government", top government officials were stealing and misusing hundreds of millions of dollars through the <a href="Kabul%20Bank">Kabul Bank</a>. According to <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a>'s 2014 corruption perceptions index results, Afghanistan was ranked as the fourth most corrupt country in the world.

The <a href="Afghan%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 Afghan presidential election</a> was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the <a href="Afghan%20presidential%20election%2C%202009">2009 presidential election</a> was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout, and widespread electoral fraud. The vote, along with elections for 420 <a href="Provinces%20of%20Afghanistan">provincial council</a> seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.

Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger <a href="Abdullah%20Abdullah">Abdullah</a> was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he would not participate in 7 November run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met. The next day, officials of the election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President for another five-year term.

In the <a href="Afghan%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202005">2005 parliamentary election</a>, among the elected officials were former mujahideen, <a href="Islamic%20fundamentalists">Islamic fundamentalists</a>, warlords, communists, <a href="reformists">reformists</a>, and several Taliban associates. In the same period, Afghanistan reached to the 30th highest nation in terms of female representation in the National Assembly. The last <a href="Afghan%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202010">parliamentary election</a> was held in September 2010, but due to disputes and investigation of fraud, the swearing-in ceremony took place in late January 2011. The <a href="Afghan%20presidential%20election%2C%202014">2014 presidential election</a> ended with Ashraf Ghani winning by 56.44% votes.

Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces ("<a href="wilayah">wilayats</a>"), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about 398 smaller provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The <a href="list%20of%20current%20governors%20of%20Afghanistan">provincial governors</a> are appointed by the <a href="President%20of%20Afghanistan">President of Afghanistan</a> and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years. The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. In the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

The following is a list of all the 34 provinces in alphabetical order:

The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Afghanistan%29">Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> is in charge of maintaining the <a href="foreign%20relations%20of%20Afghanistan">foreign relations of Afghanistan</a>. The state has been a member of the United Nations since 1946. It enjoys strong economic relations with a number of <a href="NATO">NATO</a> and allied states, particularly the <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">United States</a>, <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93United%20Kingdom%20relations">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Germany%20relations">Germany</a> and <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Turkey%20relations">Turkey</a>. In 2012, the United States designated Afghanistan as a <a href="major%20non-NATO%20ally">major non-NATO ally</a> and created the <a href="U.S.%E2%80%93Afghanistan%20Strategic%20Partnership%20Agreement">U.S.‚ÄìAfghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement</a>. Afghanistan also has friendly diplomatic relations with neighboring <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Pakistan%20relations">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Iran%20relations">Iran</a>, <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Turkmenistan%23Afghanistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Tajikistan%20relations">Tajikistan</a>, and <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93China%20relations">China</a>, and with regional states such as <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93India%20relations">India</a>, <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Bangladesh%20relations">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Russia%20relations">Russia</a>, the <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93United%20Arab%20Emirates%20relations">UAE</a>, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Japan%20relations">Japan</a>, and <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93South%20Korea%20relations">South Korea</a>. It continues to develop diplomatic relations with other countries around the world.

<a href="United%20Nations%20Assistance%20Mission%20in%20Afghanistan">United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) was established in 2002 under <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201401">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1401</a> in order to help the country recover from decades of war. Today, a number of NATO member states deploy about 38,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the <a href="International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">International Security Assistance Force</a> (ISAF). Its main purpose is to <a href="NATO%20Training%20Mission-Afghanistan">train</a> the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Security%20Forces">Afghan National Security Forces</a> (ANSF). The <a href="Afghan%20Armed%20Forces">Afghan Armed Forces</a> are under the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20%28Afghanistan%29">Ministry of Defense</a>, which includes the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan National Army</a> (ANA) and the <a href="Afghan%20Air%20Force">Afghan Air Force</a> (AAF). The ANA is divided into 6 major <a href="Corps">Corps</a>, with the <a href="201st%20Corps%20%28Afghanistan%29">201st Selab ("Flood")</a> in Kabul followed by the 203rd in Gardez, <a href="205th%20Corps">205th Atul ("Hero")</a> in Kandahar, 207th in <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, 209th in <a href="Mazar-i-Sharif">Mazar-i-Sharif</a>, and the 215th in <a href="Lashkar%20Gah">Lashkar Gah</a>. The ANA also has a <a href="ANA%20Commando%20Brigade">commando brigade</a>, which was established in 2007. The <a href="Afghan%20Defense%20University">Afghan Defense University</a> (ADU) houses various educational establishments for the Afghan Armed Forces, including the <a href="National%20Military%20Academy%20of%20Afghanistan">National Military Academy of Afghanistan</a>.

The <a href="National%20Directorate%20of%20Security">National Directorate of Security</a> (NDS) is the nation's domestic <a href="intelligence%20agency">intelligence agency</a>, which operates similar to that of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">United States Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS). The <a href="Afghan%20National%20Police">Afghan National Police</a> (ANP) is under the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Afghanistan%29">Ministry of the Interior</a> and serves as a single <a href="law%20enforcement%20in%20Afghanistan">law enforcement agency</a> all across the country. The <a href="Afghan%20National%20Civil%20Order%20Police">Afghan National Civil Order Police</a> is the main branch of the ANP, which is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, <a href="Gardez">Gardez</a>, <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, and <a href="Mazar-i-Sharif">Mazar-i-Sharif</a>. Every province has an appointed provincial <a href="Chief%20of%20Police">Chief of Police</a> who is responsible for <a href="law%20enforcement">law enforcement</a> throughout the province.

All parts of Afghanistan are considered dangerous due to militant activities. Hundreds of Afghan police are <a href="list%20of%20Afghan%20security%20forces%20fatality%20reports%20in%20Afghanistan">killed</a> in the line of duty each year. Kidnapping and robberies are also reported. The <a href="Afghan%20Border%20Police">Afghan Border Police</a> (ABP) are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed <a href="Durand%20Line">Durand Line</a> border, which is often used by members of criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. A report in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people were involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan. Attacks on government employees may be ordered by powerful mafia groups who reside inside and outside the country. Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to neighboring countries and then to other countries. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Counter%20Narcotics%20%28Afghanistan%29">Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics</a> is tasked to deal with these issues by bringing to justice major drug traffickers.

Afghanistan's <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> is around $64 billion with an exchange rate of $18.4 billion, and its <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29%20per%20capita">GDP per capita</a> is $2,000. Despite having $1 trillion or more in mineral deposits, it remains as one of the <a href="least%20developed%20countries">least developed countries</a>. The country imports over $6 billion worth of goods but exports only $658 million, mainly <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s and <a href="Nut%20%28fruit%29">nuts</a>. It has less than $1.5 billion in <a href="external%20debt">external debt</a>.

Agricultural production is the backbone of Afghanistan's economy. The country is known for producing some of the finest <a href="pomegranate%20production%20in%20Afghanistan">pomegranates</a>, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits. It is also known as the world's largest producer of <a href="Opium%20production%20in%20Afghanistan">opium</a>. Sources indicate that as much as 11% or more of the nation's economy is derived from the cultivation and sale of opium.

While the nation's current account deficit is largely financed with donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Finance%20%28Afghanistan%29">Afghan Ministry of Finance</a> is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline.

<a href="Michael%20E.%20O%27Hanlon">Michael E. O'Hanlon</a> of the <a href="Brookings%20Institution">Brookings Institution</a> estimated that if Afghanistan generates about $10 bn per year from its <a href="mining%20in%20Afghanistan">mineral deposits</a>, its <a href="gross%20national%20product">gross national product</a> would double and provide long-term funding for Afghan security forces and other critical needs.

Government officials estimate that 30% of the country's untapped mineral deposits are worth at least . One official asserted that "this will become the backbone of the Afghan economy" and a Pentagon memo stated that Afghanistan could become the "Saudi Arabia of lithium". In a 2011 news story, the "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">CSM</a>" reported, "The United States and other Western nations that have borne the brunt of the cost of the Afghan war have been conspicuously absent from the bidding process on Afghanistan's mineral deposits, leaving it mostly to regional powers."

Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes.

Albania is a <a href="Unitary%20state">unitary</a> <a href="Parliamentary%20system">parliamentary</a> <a href="constitutional%20republic">constitutional republic</a> with the capital in <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a>, the country's largest city and main economic and commercial centre, followed by <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a>. The country's other major cities include <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Vlor√´</a>, <a href="Sarand%C3%AB">Sarand√´</a>, <a href="Shkod%C3%ABr">Shkod√´r</a>, <a href="Berat">Berat</a>, <a href="Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB">Kor√ß√´</a>, <a href="Gjirokast%C3%ABr">Gjirokast√´r</a> and <a href="Fier">Fier</a>.

During the <a href="Classical%20antiquity">classical times</a>, Albania was inhabited by various ancient <a href="Illyrians">Illyrian</a>, <a href="Thracians">Thracian</a> and <a href="Chaonians">Greek</a> tribes, as well as several Greek colonies established inside the Illyrian coast. In the third century BC, the region was annexed by <a href="Roman%20Empire">Rome</a> and became part of the Roman provinces of <a href="Dalmatia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Dalmatia</a>, <a href="Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Moesia%20Superior">Moesia Superior</a>. The unified <a href="Principality%20of%20Arb%C3%ABr">Principality of Arb√´r</a> emerged in 1190, established by <a href="archon">archon</a> <a href="Progon%2C%20Lord%20of%20Kruja">Progon</a> in the <a href="Kruj%C3%AB">Kruj√´</a>, within the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. In the late twelfth century, <a href="Charles%20of%20Anjou">Charles of Anjou</a> conquered the Albanian territories from the Byzantines and established the medieval <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Albania%20%28medieval%29">Kingdom of Albania</a>, extending from <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a> along the coast to <a href="Butrint">Butrint</a> in the south. Falling in the mid-fifteenth century under <a href="Ottoman%20Albania">Ottoman dominion</a>, the modern nation state of Albania <a href="Declaration%20of%20independence%20of%20Albania">emerged</a> in 1912 following the collapse of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a>. The modern <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Albania%20%281928%E2%80%9339%29">Kingdom of Albania</a> was invaded by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a> in 1939, which formed <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281939%E2%80%9343%29">Greater Albania</a>, before becoming a <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281943%E2%80%9344%29">Nazi German</a> protectorate in 1943. The following year, a <a href="Socialist%20state">socialist</a> <a href="People%27s%20Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Albania">People's Republic</a> emerged under the leadership of <a href="Enver%20Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a> and the <a href="Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania">Party of Labour</a>. The country experienced widespread social and political transformations in the communist era, as well as isolation from much of the international community. In the aftermath of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">Revolutions</a> of 1991, the Socialist Republic was <a href="Fall%20of%20Communism%20in%20Albania">dissolved</a> and the fourth Republic of Albania was established.

Albania is a <a href="Democracy">democratic</a> and <a href="developing%20country">developing country</a> with an upper-middle income economy. The service sector dominates the country's economy, followed by the industrial and agriculture sector. Following the <a href="fall%20of%20communism%20in%20Albania">collapse of communism</a> in 1990, Albania went through a process of transition from a <a href="Planned%20economy">centralized economy</a> to a <a href="market-based%20economy">market-based economy</a>. Albania has a high <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a> and is ranked thirty-seventh in the world for <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a>. It provides <a href="universal%20health%20care">universal health care</a> and free primary and secondary education to its citizens. Albania is a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">WTO</a>, <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>, <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>, <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">OSCE</a>, and <a href="Organisation%20of%20Islamic%20Cooperation">Organisation of Islamic Cooperation</a>. It is also an <a href="Accession%20of%20Albania%20to%20the%20European%20Union">official candidate</a> for membership in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>. Furthermore, Albania is one of the founding members of the <a href="Energy%20Community">Energy Community</a>, including the <a href="Organization%20of%20the%20Black%20Sea%20Economic%20Cooperation">Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation</a>, and <a href="Union%20for%20the%20Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>. 
The term Albania is the <a href="Medieval%20Latin">medieval latin</a> name of the country. It may be derived from the <a href="Illyrian%20tribe">Illyrian tribe</a> of <a href="Albani%20%28Illyrian%20tribe%29">Albani</a> ("") recorded by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, the geographer and astronomer from <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, who drafted a map in 150¬†AD, which shows the city of <a href="Albanopolis">Albanopolis</a> located northeast of the city of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a>. The term may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called <a href="Principality%20of%20Arbanon">Albanon</a> or Arbanon, although it is not certain that this was the same place. 
In his history written in the 10th century, the <a href="byzantine">byzantine</a> historian <a href="Michael%20Attaliates">Michael Attaliates</a> was the first to refer to <a href="Albanoi">Albanoi</a> as having taken part in a revolt against <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1043 and to the Arbanitai as subjects of the Duke of <a href="Dyrrachium">Dyrrachium</a>. During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="Albanians">Albanian</a>s called their country (') and referred to themselves as (').

Nowaday, <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a> call their country Shqip√´ri or Shqip√´ria. As early as the 17th century the placename (') and the ethnic demonym (') gradually replaced (""). The two terms are <a href="folk%20etymology">popularly</a> interpreted as "Land of the Eagles" and "Children of the Eagles".

The first traces of human presence in Albania, dating to the <a href="Middle%20Paleolithic">Middle Paleolithic</a> and <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a> eras, were found in the village of Xarr√´, near <a href="Sarand%C3%AB">Sarand√´</a> and <a href="Mount%20Dajt">Mount Dajt</a> near <a href="Tiran%C3%AB">Tiran√´</a>. The objects found in a cave near Xarr√´ include flint and jasper objects and fossilized animal bones, while those found at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the <a href="Aurignacian%20culture">Aurignacian culture</a>. The Paleolithic finds of Albania show great similarities with objects of the same era found at Crvena Stijena in Montenegro and north-western Greece.

Several <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> artefacts from <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a> burials have been unearthed in central and southern Albania that show close connection with sites in south-western <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Lefkada">Lefkada</a>, Greece. Archaeologists have come to the conclusion that these regions were inhabited from the middle of the third millennium BC by <a href="Indo-European%20migrations">Indo-European</a> people who spoke a <a href="Proto-Greek%20language">Proto-Greek language</a>. A part of this population later moved to <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a> around 1600 BC and founded the <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean civilisation</a> there. Another population group, the Illirii, probably the southernmost Illyrian tribe of that time that lived on the border of Albania and <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, possibly neighbored the Greek tribes. 

In ancient times, the territory of modern Albania was mainly inhabited by a number of <a href="Illyrians">Illyrian</a> tribes. This territory was known as <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>, corresponding roughly to the area east of the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic sea</a> to the mouth of the <a href="Vjos%C3%AB">Vjos√´</a> river in the south. The first account of the Illyrian groups comes from "<a href="Periplus%20of%20the%20Euxine%20Sea">Periplus of the Euxine Sea</a>", an ancient Greek text written in the middle of the 4th century BC. The south was inhabited by the Greek tribe of the <a href="Chaonians">Chaonians</a>, whose capital was at <a href="Phoenice">Phoenice</a>, while numerous colonies, such as <a href="Apollonia%20%28Illyria%29">Apollonia</a>, <a href="Epidamnos">Epidamnos</a> and <a href="Amantia">Amantia</a>, were established by Greek city-states on the coast by the 7th century BC.

One of the most powerful tribes that ruled over modern Albania was the <a href="Ardiaei">Ardiaei</a>. The <a href="Ardiaean%20Kingdom">Ardiaean Kingdom</a> reached its greatest extent under <a href="Agron%20of%20Illyria">Agron</a>, son of <a href="Pleuratus%20II">Pleuratus II</a>. Agron extended his rule over other neighboring tribes as well. After Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife <a href="Teuta">Teuta</a> inherited the¬†Ardiaean kingdom. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southward into the¬†<a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>. In 229 BC, Rome declared war on Illyria for extensively plundering Roman ships. The war ended in Illyrian defeat in 227¬†BC. Teuta was eventually succeeded by¬†<a href="Gentius">Gentius</a>¬†in 181¬†BC. Gentius clashed with the Romans in 168¬†BC, initiating the <a href="Third%20Illyrian%20War">Third Illyrian War</a>. The conflict resulted in Roman victory and the end of Illyrian independence by 167¬†BC. After his defeat, the Roman split the region into three administrative divisions.

During the medieval period, the area what is now known as Albania, remained under <a href="Albania%20under%20the%20Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> control until the <a href="Slavic%20migrations">Slavs</a> began to overrun the country from the 7th century. Later it was captured by the <a href="Albania%20under%20the%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian Empire</a> in the 9th century. After the weakening of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> and the <a href="Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian Empire</a> in the 13th century, some of the territory of modern Albania was captured by the <a href="Serbian%20Grand%20Principality">Serbian Principality</a>. In general, the invaders destroyed or weakened Roman and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> cultural centers in the lands, that would become Albania.

The territorial nucleus of the Albanian state formed in the Middle Ages, as the <a href="Principality%20of%20Arb%C3%ABr">Principality of Arb√´r</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Albania%20%28medieval%29">Kingdom of Albania</a>. The <a href="Principality%20of%20Arb%C3%ABr">Principality of Arb√´r</a> or Albanon "(Arb√´r or Arb√´ria)", was the first <a href="Albanian%20Principalities">Albanian entiy</a> during the Middle Ages, it was established by <a href="archon">archon</a> <a href="Progon%20of%20Kruja">Progon</a> "(Progoni i Kruj√´s)" in the region of <a href="Kruj%C3%AB">Kruj√´</a>, in 1190. Progon, was succeeded by his sons <a href="Gjin%20Progoni">Gjin</a> and Dhimitri, the latter which attained the height of the realm. After the death of Dhimiter, the last of the <a href="Progon%20family">Progon family</a>, the principality came under the <a href="Greek%20People">Greek</a> <a href="Gregory%20Kamonas">Gregory Kamonas</a> <a href="Progon%20of%20Kruja">Lord of Kruj√´</a>, and later <a href="Golem%20of%20Kruja">Golem</a>. The Principality was dissolved in 1255. Pipa and Repishti conclude that Arbanon was the first sketch of an "Albanian state", and that it retained semi-autonomous status as the western extremity of an empire (under the <a href="Doukas">Doukai</a> of <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Epirus</a> or the <a href="Laskaris">Laskarids</a> of <a href="Empire%20of%20Nicaea">Nicaea</a>).

The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Albania%20%28medieval%29">Kingdom of Albania</a> "(Mbret√´ria e Arb√´ris√´)" was established by <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Naples">Charles of Anjou</a> "(Karli Anzhu)" in the Albanian territory. In 1271, he conquered from the <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Despotate of Epirus</a>. One year later in February 1272, he took the title of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Albania%20%28medieval%29">King of Albania</a>. The kingdom extended from the region of <a href="Dyrrhachium">Dyrrhachium</a> (modern <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a>), south along the coast to <a href="Butrint">Butrint</a>. After the creation of the kingdom, a catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading Catholicism in the Balkans. This plan found also the support of <a href="Helen%20of%20Anjou">Helen of Anjou</a>, a cousin of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Naples">Charles of Anjou</a>, who was at that time ruling territories in North Albania. Around 30 catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule in North Albania and also in Serbia. From 1331 to 1355, the <a href="Serbian%20Empire">Serbian Empire</a> wrestled control over Albania. After the dissolution of the Serbian Empire, several <a href="Albanian%20principalities">Albanian principalities</a> were created, and among the most powerful were the <a href="Balsha">Balsha</a>, <a href="Thopia%20family">Thopia</a>, <a href="Kastrioti%20Principality">Kastrioti</a>, <a href="Muzaka%20family">Muzaka</a> and <a href="Arianiti%20family">Arianiti</a>. In the first half of the 14th century, the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> invaded most of Albania. In 1444, the Albanian principalities were united under <a href="Skanderbeg">George Castrioti Skanderbeg</a> "(Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu)", who became the national hero of the Albanian medieval history. 

At the dawn of the establishment of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in southeastern <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small principalities. The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout southern Albania in 1415 and occupied most of the country in 1431. However, in 1443 a great and longstanding <a href="History%20of%20the%20Albanian-Turkish%20Wars">revolt</a> broke out under the lead of the Albanian national hero <a href="Skanderbeg">George Castrioti Skanderbeg</a> "(Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu)", which lasted until 1479, many times defeating major <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> armies led by the sultans <a href="Murad%20II">Murad II</a> and <a href="Mehmed%20II">Mehmed II</a>. Skanderbeg united initially the Albanian princes, and later on established a centralized authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the ruling "Lord of Albania". He also tried relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a>s. He thwarted every attempt by the Turks to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and western <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. His unequal fight against the mightiest power of the time, won the esteem of Europe as well as some support in the form of money and military aid from <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="Ragusa%2C%20Sicily">Ragusa</a> and the <a href="Papacy">Papacy</a>.
With the arrival of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a>s, <a href="Islam%20in%20Albania">Islam</a> was introduced in the country as a third religion. This conversion caused a massive emigration of <a href="Albanian%20diaspora">Albanian</a>s to other Christian European countries, especially the <a href="Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB%20people">Arb√´resh√´</a> of Italy. Along with the <a href="Bosniaks">Bosniaks</a>, Muslim Albanians occupied an outstanding position in the Ottoman Empire, and were the main pillars of Ottoman Porte's policy in the Balkans.

Enjoying this privileged position in the empire, Muslim Albanians held various high administrative positions, with over two dozen <a href="Grand%20Viziers">Grand Viziers</a> of Albanian origin, such as Gen. <a href="K%C3%B6pr%C3%BCl%C3%BC%20Mehmed%20Pasha">K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha</a>, who commanded the Ottoman forces during the <a href="Ottoman-Persian%20Wars">Ottoman-Persian Wars</a>; Gen. <a href="K%C3%B6pr%C3%BCl%C3%BC%20Faz%C4%B1l%20Ahmed">K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed</a>, who led the Ottoman armies during the <a href="Austro-Turkish%20War%20%281663%E2%80%931664%29">Austro-Turkish War</a>; and later <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Pasha">Muhammad Ali Pasha</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

During the 15th century, when the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a>s were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal <a href="sanjaks">sanjaks</a>. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> (at the end of the 15th century). The city of <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Vlor√´</a> saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices, and leather from <a href="Bursa">Bursa</a> and <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. Some citizens of <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Vlor√´</a> even had business associates throughout <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

<a href="Albanians">Albanian</a>s could also be found throughout the empire in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> and across the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>, as vital military and administrative retainers.
This was partly due to the <a href="Dev%C5%9Firme">Dev≈üirme</a> system. The process of Islamization was an incremental one, commencing from the arrival of the Ottomans in the 14th century (to this day, a minority of Albanians are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, though the vast majority became Muslim). <a href="Timar">Timar</a> holders, the bedrock of early Ottoman control in southeast Europe, were not necessarily converts to Islam, and occasionally rebelled; the most famous of these rebels is <a href="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a> (his figure would rise up later on, in the 19th century, as a central component of the Albanian national identity). The most significant impact on the <a href="Albanians">Albanian</a>s was the gradual Islamisation process of a large majority of the population, although it became widespread only in the 17th century.

Mainly <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a> converted in the 17th century, while the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century. Initially confined to the main city centres of <a href="Elbasan">Elbasan</a> and <a href="Shkod%C3%ABr">Shkod√´r</a>, by this period the countryside was also embracing the new religion. The motives for conversion according to some scholars were diverse, depending on the context. The lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues. Albania remained under Ottoman control as part of the <a href="Rumelia">Rumelia</a> province until 1912, when <a href="independent%20Albania">independent Albania</a> was <a href="Albanian%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declared</a>.

The National Renaissance "(Rilindja Komb√´tare)" began in the 1870s and lasted until 1912, when the <a href="Albanians">Albanian</a>s declared their <a href="Declaration%20of%20independence%20of%20Albania">independence</a>. The <a href="League%20of%20Prizren">League of Prizren</a> (League for the Defense of the Rights of the Albanian Nation) "(Lidhja e Prizrenit)" was formed on June 1878, in the old town of <a href="Prizren">Prizren</a>, <a href="Kosovo%20Vilayet">Kosovo Vilayet</a>. At first the Ottoman authorities supported the League, whose initial position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim <a href="landlords">landlords</a> and people connected with the <a href="Ottoman%20Porte">Ottoman administration</a>. The <a href="Ottomans">Ottoman</a>s favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity, and called for defense of Muslim lands, including present-day <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. This was the reason for naming the league 'The Committee of the Real Muslims' "(Komiteti i Mysliman√´ve t√´ V√´rtet√´)". The League issued a decree known as <a href="Kararname%20%28League%20of%20Prizren%29">Kararname</a>. Its text contained a proclamation that the people from northern Albania, Epirus and Bosnia" are willing to defend the 'territorial integrity' of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> by all possible means against the troops of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbian</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro">Montenegrin</a> Kingdoms. However, it was signed by 47 Muslim deputies of the League on June 18, 1878. Around 300 Muslims participated in the assembly, including delegates from Bosnia and mutasarrif (<a href="sanjakbey">sanjakbey</a>) of the <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Prizren">Sanjak of Prizren</a> as representatives of the central authorities, and no delegates from <a href="Scutari%20Vilayet">Scutari Vilayet</a>.

The <a href="Ottomans">Ottoman</a>s cancelled their support when the League, under the influence of <a href="Abdyl%20Frash%C3%ABri">Abdyl Bey Frash√´ri</a>, became focused on working toward the Albanian autonomy and requested merging of four <a href="Ottoman%20vilayet">Ottoman vilayet</a>s, which includes <a href="Kosovo%20Vilayet">Kosovo</a>, <a href="Scutari%20Vilayet">Scutari</a>, <a href="Monastir%20Vilayet">Monastir</a> and <a href="Janina%20Vilayet">Ioannina</a> into a new <a href="vilayet">vilayet</a> of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, the <a href="Albanian%20Vilayet">Albanian Vilayet</a>. The League used military force to prevent the annexing areas of <a href="Plav%20Municipality">Plav</a> and <a href="Gusinje">Gusinje</a> assigned to <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> by the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a>. After several successful battles with Montenegrin troops such as in <a href="Battle%20of%20Nov%C5%A1i%C4%87e">Novsice</a>, under the pressure of the <a href="great%20powers">great powers</a>, the <a href="League%20of%20Prizren">League of Prizren</a> was forced to retreat from their contested regions of <a href="Plav%2C%20Montenegro">Plav</a> and <a href="Gusinje">Gusinje</a> and later on, the league was defeated by the <a href="Ottoman%20Army">Ottoman army</a> sent by the Sultan. The <a href="Albanian%20Revolt%20of%201912">Albanian uprising</a> of 1912, the Ottoman defeat in the <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a> and the advance of Montenegrin, Serbian and Greek forces into territories claimed as Albanian, led to the <a href="Albanian%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">proclamation of independence</a> by <a href="Ismail%20Qemali">Ismail Qemali</a> in southern <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Vlor√´</a>, on November 28, 1912.

At the <a href="All-Albanian%20Congress">All-Albanian Congress</a> in southern <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Vlor√´</a> on 28 November 1912, the participants constituted the <a href="Assembly%20of%20Vlor%C3%AB">Assembly of Vlor√´</a>. The assembly of eighty-three leaders, declared the nation as an independent country and set up a provisional government. The <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Albania">Provisional Government</a> was established on the second session of the assembly on 4 December 1912. Furthermore, it was a government of ten members led by <a href="Ismail%20Qemali">Ismail Qemali</a>, until his resignation on 22 January 1914. However the Assembly also established the <a href="Senate%20of%20Albania">Senate</a> "(Pleq√´si)", with an advisory role to the government, consisting of 18 members of the Assembly.

The independence of Albania was recognized by the <a href="London%20Conference%20of%201912%E2%80%931913">Conference of London</a> on 29 July 1913. The drawing of the borders of the newly established <a href="Principality%20of%20Albania">Principality of Albania</a> ignored the demographic realities of the time. The <a href="International%20Commission%20of%20Control">International Commission of Control</a> was established on 15 October 1913 to take care of the administration of newly established Albania, until its own political institutions were in order. Its headquarters were in <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Vlor√´</a>. The <a href="International%20Gendarmerie">International Gendarmerie</a> was established as the first <a href="law%20enforcement%20agency">law enforcement agency</a> of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Albania">Principality of Albania</a>. In November, the first gendarmerie members arrived in the country. Prince of Albania <a href="Wilhelm%20of%20Wied">Wilhelm of Wied</a> "(Princ Vilhelm Vidi)" was selected as the first prince of the principality. On 7 March, he arrived in the provisional capital of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a> and started to organise his government, appointing <a href="Turhan%20Pasha%20P%C3%ABrmeti">Turhan Pasha P√´rmeti</a> to form the first Albanian cabinet.

In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne of Albania to the Ottoman war Minister of Albanian origin, <a href="Ahmed%20Izzet%20Pasha">Ahmed Izzet Pasha</a>. The pro-Ottoman peasants believed that, the new regime of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Albania">Principality of Albania</a> was a tool of the six Christian <a href="Great%20Power">Great Power</a>s and local landowners, that owned half of the arable land.

In February 1914, the <a href="Autonomous%20Republic%20of%20Northern%20Epirus">Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus</a> was proclaimed in <a href="Gjirokast%C3%ABr">Gjirokast√´r</a> by the local <a href="Greeks%20in%20Albania">Greek population</a> against incorporation to Albania. This initiative was short lived and in 1921, the southern provinces were finally incorporated to the <a href="Principality%20of%20Albania">Albanian Principality</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="Peasant%20Revolt%20in%20Albania">revolt of Albanian peasants</a> against the new Albanian regime erupted under the leadership of the group of Muslim clerics gathered around <a href="Essad%20Pasha%20Toptani">Essad Pasha Toptani</a>, who proclaimed himself the savior of Albania and Islam. In order to gain support of the <a href="Mirdita">Mirdita</a> Catholic volunteers from the northern part of Albania, Prince <a href="Wilhelm%20of%20Wied">Wied</a> appointed their leader, <a href="Pr%C3%AAnk%20Bib%C3%AB%20Doda">Pr√™nk Bib√´ Doda</a>, to be the foreign minister of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Albania">Principality of Albania</a>. In May and June 1914, the <a href="International%20Gendarmerie">International Gendarmerie</a> was joined by <a href="Isa%20Boletini">Isa Boletini</a> and his men, mostly from <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, and northern <a href="Mirdita">Mirdita</a> Catholics, were defeated by the rebels who captured most of Central Albania by the end of August 1914. The regime of Prince <a href="Wilhelm%20of%20Wied">Wied</a> collapsed and later he left the country on 3 September 1914.

The short-lived <a href="Principality%20of%20Albania">principality</a> (1914‚Äì1925) was succeeded by the first <a href="Albanian%20Republic">Albanian Republic</a> (1925‚Äì1928). In 1925 the four-member Regency was abolished and <a href="Zog%20I%20of%20Albania">Ahmed Zogu</a> was elected president of the newly declared republic. <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a> was endorsed officially as the country's permanent capital. Zogu led an authoritarian and conservative regime, the primary aim of which was the maintenance of stability and order. Zogu was forced to adopt a policy of cooperation with Italy. A pact had been signed between Italy and Albania on 20 January 1925 whereby Italy gained a monopoly on shipping and trade concessions.

The Albanian republic was eventually replaced by another <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Albania%20%281928%E2%80%9339%29">monarchy</a> in 1928. In order to extend his direct control throughout the entire country, Zogu placed great emphasis on the construction of roads. Every male Albanian over the age of 16 years was legally bound to give ten days of free labor each year to the state. King Zogu remained a conservative, but initiated reforms. For example, in an attempt at social modernization, the custom of adding one's region to one's name was dropped. Zogu also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals. The armed forces were trained and supervised by Italian instructors. As a counterweight, Zogu kept British officers in the <a href="Gendarmerie">Gendarmerie</a> despite strong Italian pressure to remove them. The kingdom was supported by the <a href="Italian%20Fascism">fascist regime in Italy</a> and the two countries maintained close relations until Italy's sudden <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania">invasion of the country</a> in 1939. Albania was occupied by <a href="Italian%20Fascism">Fascist Italy</a> and <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281943%E2%80%931944%29">then</a> by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> during World War II. 

After being <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania">militarily occupied by Italy</a>, from 1939 until 1943 the <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281939%E2%80%9343%29">Albanian Kingdom</a> was a <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> and a <a href="Dependent%20territory">dependency</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Italy</a> governed by the Italian King <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy">Victor Emmanuel III</a> and his government. After the Axis' <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, territories of Yugoslavia with substantial Albanian population were annexed to Albania: most of Kosovo, as well as Western Macedonia, the town of <a href="Tutin%2C%20Serbia">Tutin</a> in Central Serbia and a strip of Eastern Montenegro. In November 1941, the small Albanian Communist groups established an¬†Albanian Communist Party¬†in Tirana of 130 members under the leadership of <a href="Enver%20Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a> and an eleven-man Central Committee. The party at first had little mass appeal, and even its youth organization netted few recruits.

After the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Nazi Germany occupied Albania too. The nationalist <a href="Balli%20Komb%C3%ABtar">Balli Kombetar</a>, which had fought against Italy, formed a "neutral" government in Tirana, and side by side with the Germans fought against the communist-led <a href="National%20Liberation%20Movement%20%28Albania%29">National Liberation Movement of Albania</a>. The Center for Relief to Civilian Populations (Geneva) reported that Albania was one of the most devastated countries in Europe. 60,000 houses were destroyed and about 10% of the population was left homeless. The communist partisans had regrouped and gained control of much of southern Albania in January 1944. However, they were subject to German attacks driving them out of certain areas. In the Congress of P√´rmet, the NLF formed an Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation to act as Albania's administration and legislature. By the last year in World War II Albania fell into a civil war-like state between the communists and nationalists. The communist partisans however defeated the last Balli Komb√´tar forces in southern Albania by mid-summer 1944. Before the end of November, the main German troops had withdrawn from <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a>, and the communists took control by attacking it. The partisans entirely liberated Albania from German occupation on 29 November 1944. A provisional government, which the communists had formed at¬†Berat¬†in October, administered Albania with Enver Hoxha as prime minister.

By the end of the <a href="World%20War%20II">second World War</a>, the main military and political force of the nation, the Communist party sent forces to northern Albania against the nationalists to eliminate its rivals. They faced open resistance in <a href="Nikaj-M%C3%ABrtur">Nikaj-M√´rtur</a>, <a href="Dukagjin%20highlands">Dukagjin</a> and <a href="Kelmendi%20%28tribe%29">Kelmend</a> led by <a href="Prek%20Cali">Prek Cali</a>. On 15 January 1945, a clash took place between partisans of the first Brigade and nationalist forces at the Tamara Bridge, resulting in the defeat of the nationalist forces. About 150 <a href="Kelmendi%20%28tribe%29">Kelmendi</a> people were killed or tortured. This event was the starting point of many other issues which took place during <a href="Enver%20Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a>'s dictatorship. <a href="Class%20conflict">Class struggle</a> was strictly applied, human freedom and <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> were denied. The <a href="Kelmend%20%28municipality%29">Kelmend</a> region was almost isolated by both the border and by a lack of roads for another 20 years, the institution of <a href="agricultural%20cooperative">agricultural cooperative</a>s brought about economic decline. Many Kelmendi people fled, some were executed trying to cross the border.

After the liberation of Albania from the <a href="Albanian%20resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II">Nazi occupation</a>, the country became a <a href="Communist%20state">Communist state</a>. Afterwards, the <a href="People%27s%20Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Albania">People's Republic of Albania</a> "(renamed "People's Socialist Republic of Albania" in 1976)" was founded, which was led by <a href="Enver%20Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a> and the <a href="Labour%20Party%20of%20Albania">Labour Party of Albania</a>. The socialist reconstruction of Albania was launched immediately after the annulling of the monarchy and the establishment of a <a href="People%27s%20Republic">People's Republic</a>. In 1947, Albania's first railway line was completed, with the second one being completed eight months later. New land reform laws were passed granting ownership of the land to the workers and peasants who tilled it. Agriculture became <a href="Worker%20cooperative">cooperative</a>, and production increased significantly, leading to Albania's becoming agriculturally self-sufficient. By 1955, illiteracy was eliminated among Albania's adult population.

During this period, Albania became industrialized and saw rapid economic growth, as well as unprecedented progress in the areas of education and health care. The average annual increase in Albania's national income was 29% higher than the world average and 56% higher than the European average.. The nation incurred large debts, first with <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> until 1948, then the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> until 1961, and <a href="China">China</a> from the middle of the 1950s. The communist <a href="Constitution%20of%20Albania">constitution</a> did not allow taxes on individuals; instead, taxes were imposed on cooperatives and other organizations, with much the same effect.
<a href="Freedom%20of%20religion%20in%20Albania">Religious freedoms</a> were severely curtailed during the communist regime, with all forms of worship being outlawed. In August 1945, the "Agrarian Reform Law" meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups (mostly Islamic <a href="waqfs">waqfs</a>) were nationalized, along with the estates of monasteries and dioceses. Many believers, along with the <a href="ulema">ulema</a> and many <a href="priests">priests</a>, were arrested and executed. In 1949, a new Decree on Religious Communities required that all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone.

After hundreds of mosques and dozens of Islamic libraries, containing priceless manuscripts, were destroyed, <a href="Enver%20Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a> proclaimed Albania the "World's first <a href="State%20atheism">atheist state</a>" in 1967. The churches had not been spared either, and many were converted into cultural centers for young people. A 1967 law banned all "fascist, religious, warmongerish, antisocialist activity and propaganda". Preaching religion carried a three to ten-year prison sentence. Nonetheless, many Albanians continued to practice their beliefs secretly. The Hoxha dictatorship's anti-religious policy attained its most fundamental legal and political expression a decade later: "The state recognizes no religion," states Albania's 1976 constitution, "and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people." <a href="Enver%20Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a>'s political successor, <a href="Ramiz%20Alia">Ramiz Alia</a> oversaw the dismemberment of the "<a href="Hoxhaist">Hoxhaist</a>" state during the collapse of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> in the late 1980s.

After the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">revolution of 1989</a>, reforms were made by the communist government in 1990. Subsequently, the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Albania">People's Republic</a> was dissolved and the 4th <a href="Independent%20Albania">Albanian Republic</a> was founded on 29 April 1991. The communists retained a stronghold in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Albania">Parliament</a>, after popular support in the first <a href="multi-party%20elections">multi-party elections</a> in <a href="Albanian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201991">1991</a>. In March 1992, amid liberalization policies resulting in economic collapse and social unrest, a new coalition led by the new <a href="Democratic%20Party%20of%20Albania">Democratic Party</a> took power after victory in the <a href="Albanian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201992">parliamentary elections</a> of 1992. 

In the following years, much of the accumulated wealth of the country was invested in <a href="Ponzi%20scheme">Ponzi</a> pyramid banking schemes, which were widely supported by the <a href="Government%20of%20Albania">government</a>. The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the <a href="Demographics%20of%20Albania">Albanian population</a>. Despite the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a> warnings in late 1996, <a href="President%20of%20Albania">President</a> <a href="Sali%20Berisha">Sali Berisha</a> defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes. The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February 1997 as government forces responded with fire. In March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The <a href="1997%20rebellion%20in%20Albania">resulting crisis</a> caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and of refugees.

The crisis led <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Albania">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Aleksand%C3%ABr%20Meksi">Aleksand√´r Meksi</a> to resign on 11 March 1997, followed by <a href="President%20of%20Albania">President</a> <a href="Sali%20Berisha">Sali Berisha</a> in July in the wake of the June General Election. In April 1997, <a href="Operation%20Alba">Operation Alba</a>, a <a href="United%20Nations">UN</a> peacekeeping force led by <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, entered the country with two goals: to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international organizations. The main international organization involved was the <a href="Western%20European%20Union">Western European Union</a>'s <a href="Albanian%20civil%20war%20of%201997%23International%20intervention">Multinational Albanian Police element (MAPE)</a>, which worked with the government to restructure the <a href="Judicial%20system%20of%20Albania">judicial system</a> and the <a href="Albanian%20Police">Albanian Police</a>. The <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20Albania">Socialist Party</a> had won the previously mentioned <a href="Albanian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201997">parliamentary elections in June 1997</a>, and a degree of political stabilization followed. In 1999, the country was affected by the <a href="1999%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kosovo War</a>, which caused a great number of ethnic <a href="Kosovo%20Albanians">Albanian</a>s from <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> to seek refuge in Albania, although most ultimately returned to Kosovo.

On 23 June 2013, the eighth <a href="Albanian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202013">parliamentary elections</a> took place, won by <a href="Edi%20Rama">Edi Rama</a> of the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20Albania">Socialist Party</a>. During his tenure as <a href="List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Albania">33rd</a> <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Albania">Prime Minister</a>, Albania has implemented numerous reforms focused on the <a href="Modernism">modernizing</a> the <a href="Economy%20of%20Albania">economy</a> and democratizing of <a href="State%20institution">state institutions</a> like the <a href="Judiciary%20of%20Albania">judiciary</a> and <a href="Law%20enforcement%20in%20Albania">law enforcement</a>. Additionally, unemployment has been steadily reduced to the 4th lowest <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20unemployment%20rate">unemployment rate</a> in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>.

After the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">collapse of the Eastern Bloc</a>, Albania started to develop closer ties with Western Europe. At the <a href="2008%20Bucharest%20summit">2008 Bucharest summit</a>, the <a href="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</a> invited Albania to join the alliance. In April 2014 Albania became a full member of <a href="NATO">NATO</a>. Albania was among the first southeastern European countries to join the Partnership for peace programme. Albania <a href="Accession%20of%20Albania%20to%20the%20European%20Union">applied</a> to join the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, becoming an official candidate for accession to the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> in June 2014. Although Albania received candidate status for the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> membership in 2014 (based on its 2009 application), the European Union has twice rejected full membership. The <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> warned the <a href="Government%20of%20Albania">Government leaders</a> in early 2017 that the 2017 <a href="Albanian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202017">parliamentary election</a>s in June must be free and fair before negotiations could begin to admit the country into the union.

Albania occupies the southwestern portion of the <a href="Balkan%20Peninsula">Balkan Peninsula</a>. The country is located in <a href="Southeastern%20Europe">Southeastern</a> and <a href="Southern%20Europe">Southern Europe</a>, with <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> bordering to the northwest, <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> to the northeast, <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a> to the east and <a href="Greece">Greece</a> to the south.

The territory covers , making it the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20and%20dependencies%20by%20area">145th largest country</a> in the world. Albania's coastline length is and extends along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas within the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. 

Albania's northernmost point is <a href="V%C3%ABrmosh">V√´rmosh</a> at 42¬∞ 35' 34" northern latitude; the southernmost is <a href="Konispol">Konispol</a> at 39¬∞ 40' 0" northern latitude; the westernmost point is <a href="Sazan%20Island">Sazan Island</a> at 19¬∞ 16' 50" eastern longitude; and the easternmost point is <a href="V%C3%ABrnik">V√´rnik</a> at 21¬∞ 1' 26" eastern longitude.

The distance from east to west is , from north to south .

Despite its small size, Albania is dominated by mountainous or high terrain, with a wide variety of natural features including valleys, plains, canyons and caves. Topographically, the mountains run the length of the country from north to south; the <a href="Albanian%20Alps">Albanian Alps</a> in the north, <a href="Sharr%20Mountains">Sharr Mountains</a> in the northeast, <a href="Central%20Mountain%20Range%2C%20Albania%23Skanderbeg%20Mountains">Skanderbeg Mountains</a> in the center, <a href="Korab">Korab Mountains</a> in the east, <a href="Pindus%20Mountains">Pindus Mountains</a> in the southeast and the <a href="Ceraunian%20Mountains">Ceraunian Mountains</a> in the southwest along the <a href="Albanian%20Riviera">Albanian Riviera</a>. 

The hydrographic network of Albania includes several of the largest and most ancient bodies of <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a> in <a href="Southern%20Europe">Southern Europe</a>. <a href="Lake%20Shkod%C3%ABr">Lake Shkod√´r</a> is the largest lake, situated in the northwest with a surface which can vary between and , out of which one third belongs to Albania and the rest to Montenegro. It is the largest lake in Southern Europe. <a href="Ohrid%20Lake">Lake Ohrid</a> in the southeast is shared with Macedonia and is one of the most <a href="ancient%20lake">ancient lake</a>s in the world. <a href="Lake%20Prespa">Lake Prespa</a> at the border triangle with Macedonia and Greece is one the highest <a href="tectonic">tectonic</a> lakes within the <a href="Balkan%20Peninsula">Balkan Peninsula</a> at an <a href="elevation">elevation</a> of .

Inland conditions vary depending on <a href="elevation">elevation</a>, but the higher areas above in the <a href="Northern%20Mountain%20Range%2C%20Albania">northern</a> and <a href="Central%20Mountain%20Range%2C%20Albania">central highlands</a> are rather cold and frequently snowy in winter; here cold conditions with snow may linger into spring. The temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Average <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and the continental air mass.Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the <a href="Central%20Mountain%20Range%2C%20Albania">central highlands</a>. When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter.

Lowland rainfall averages from to more than annually, with the higher levels in the north. Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter. Rainfall in the northern highlands is heavier. Adequate records are not available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are probably about and are as high as . However, the western <a href="Albanian%20Alps">Albanian Alps</a> are among the wettest areas in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, receiving some of rain annually. The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area. The central highlands receive less precipitation than the intermediate northern highlands. Terrain differences cause wide local variations, but the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area. In 2009, an expedition from the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado">University of Colorado</a> discovered four small <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s inside the Albanian Alps. The glaciers are at the relatively low level of , almost unique for such a southerly latitude.

In 2016, the <a href="Government%20of%20Albania">Government of Albania</a> reached an agreement with <a href="Tirana%20International%20Airport">Tirana International Airport</a> to end its monopoly on flights, paving the way for the opening of an <a href="Kuk%C3%ABs%20International%20Airport%20Shaikh%20Zayed">airport</a> at <a href="Kuk%C3%ABs">Kuk√´s</a> in the north.

The railways in Albania are administered by the national railway company <a href="Hekurudha%20Shqiptare">Hekurudha Shqiptare</a>. The railway system was extensively promoted by the <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarian</a> communist regime of dictator <a href="Enver%20Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a>, during which time the use of private transport was effectively prohibited. Since the collapse of the communist regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage. A new railway line from the capital <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a> via <a href="Tirana%20International%20Airport%20N%C3%ABn%C3%AB%20Tereza">Tirana International Airport</a> to the port city <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a> is currently planned. The location of this railway, connecting the most populated urban areas in Albania, makes it an important economic development project. The opening will take place in 2019.
Until 1990, after the <a href="Fall%20of%20communism%20in%20Albania">fall of Communism in Albania</a>, the country was one of the world's most isolated and controlled countries, and installation and maintenance of a modern system of international and domestic telecommunications was precluded. Callers previously needed operator assistance even to make domestic long-distance calls.
Internet in Albania is fast and inexpensive in comparison to the rest of Europe. For example, an ISP known as ABcom, offers a 30mbit download package for 306.999 lek√´ ($2.39579 USD) per month. In the mobile network industry, providers such as <a href="Vodafone%20Albania">Vodafone</a>, <a href="Telekom%20Albania">Telekom</a>, <a href="Albanian%20Mobile%20Communications">Albanian Mobile Communications</a> and <a href="Eagle%20Mobile">Eagle Mobile</a> provide both <a href="3G">3G</a> and <a href="4G">4G</a> data plans. From 1993 human resources in sciences and technology have drastically decreased. Various surveys show that during 1991‚Äì2005, approximately 50% of the professors and research scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have emigrated.

However, in 2009 the government approved the "National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania" covering the period 2009‚Äì15. It aims to triple public spending on research and development (R&D) to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of gross domestic expenditure on R&D from foreign sources, including via the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>'s Framework Programmes for Research, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others.

Energy in Albania is dependent on <a href="Hydroelectricity%20in%20Albania">hydroelectricity</a>. Albania is the largest producer of <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a> in the world, having a percentage of 100%. The country is host to five hydroelectric power stations and a plant. Almost four power stations including <a href="Fierza%20Hydroelectric%20Power%20Station">Fierza</a>, <a href="Koman%20Hydroelectric%20Power%20Station">Koman</a>, <a href="Skavica%20Hydro%20Power%20Plant">Skavica</a> and <a href="Vau%20i%20Dej%C3%ABs%20Hydroelectric%20Power%20Station">Vau i Dej√´s</a> are situated on the <a href="Drin%20%28river%29">Drin River</a>, the longest river in the country with a total length of 335¬†km (208¬†mi). Due to its strategical location, it plays a significant role for the production of electricity in Albania.

Albania and Croatia have discussed the possibility of jointly building a nuclear power plant at <a href="Lake%20Shkod%C3%ABr">Lake Shkod√´r</a>, close to the <a href="Border%20crossings%20of%20Albania">border</a> with Montenegro, a plan that has gathered criticism from Montenegro due to seismicity in the area. In February 2009 Italian company <a href="Enel">Enel</a> announced plans to build an 800 MW coal-fired power plant in Albania, to diversify electricity sources.

The <a href="Economy%20of%20Albania">Albanian</a> Devoll Hydropower company, owned and operated by Norwegian <a href="Statkraft">Statkraft</a>, is currently build two hydroelectricity plants on the <a href="Devoll%20%28river%29">Devoll River</a> near <a href="Banj%C3%AB%20Hydro%20Power%20Plant">Banj√´</a> and <a href="Moglic%C3%AB%20Hydro%20Power%20Plant">Moglic√´</a>. The <a href="Moglic%C3%AB%20Hydro%20Power%20Plant">Moglic√´ Hydro Power Plant</a> is anticipated to be the world's highest of its kind upon completion. The "Devoll Hydropower Project" is one of the largest hydropower investments in the <a href="Balkan%20peninsula">Balkan peninsula</a>. The two plants are expected to be completed in 2016 and 2018. After its completion, it will produce 729 GWh annually, increasing the electricity production in Albania by almost 17%.

Radio in Albania began officially in 1938 with the founding of <a href="RTSH">RTSH</a> "(Albania Radio and Television - Radio Televizioni Shqiptar)", and television broadcasting began in 1960. Almost 4 regional radio stations serve in the four extremities of Albania. The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via <a href="medium%20wave">medium wave</a> (AM) and <a href="short%20wave">short wave</a> (SW). The international service has used the theme from the song "Keputa nj√´ gjethe dafine" as its <a href="signature%20tune">signature tune</a>. The international television service <a href="satellite">via satellite</a> was launched since 1993 and aims at <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a> communities in Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and northern Greece, plus the Albanian <a href="diaspora">diaspora</a> in the rest of Europe. According to the Albanian Media Authority, Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations. In Llast years, Albania has organized several shows as a part of worldwide series like "<a href="Dancing%20with%20the%20Stars">Dancing with the Stars</a>", "<a href="Big%20Brother%20Albania">Big Brother</a>", "<a href="Albanians%20Got%20Talent">Got Talent</a>", "<a href="The%20Voice%20of%20Albania">The Voice</a>", and "<a href="X%20Factor%20%28Albanian%20TV%20series%29">X Factor</a>".

Albania ranked 34th in the 2003 <a href="Press%20Freedom%20Index">Press Freedom Index</a> report compiled by the <a href="Reporters%20Without%20Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>. In 2016, it ranked 82nd. In 2016, there were 1.82 million <a href="Internet%20users">Internet users</a> in the country in percentage 63% of the population.

Following the <a href="fall%20of%20communism%20in%20Albania">fall of communism in Albania</a> in 1991, a reorganization plan was announced that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, major <a href="Albanian%20civil%20war%20of%201997">economic and political crisis</a> in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Widespread vandalism and extreme shortages of textbooks and supplies had a devastating effect on school operations, prompting Italy and other countries to provide material assistance. In the late 1990, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed, to improve learning conditions. Most of the improvements have happened in the larger cities of the country especially in <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a>, <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a> and <a href="Shkod%C3%ABr">Shkod√´r</a>.

All educational programmes in Albania are regulated by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%20%28Albania%29">Ministry of Education</a> and administered by local municipalities. Education is mostly supported by the state and is composed of three stages, primary education (arsimi fillor√´), secondary education (arsimi i mes√´m), and tertiary education (arsimi universitar√´). The academic year is very similar to the one in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, with classes starting in September or October and ending in June or July. <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a> is the primary language of instruction in all <a href="state%20school">public school</a>s. The <a href="primary%20education">primary education</a> is obligatory from grade one to nine. Students must pass the graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade in order to continue their education. After the primary school, the general education is provided at the <a href="Secondary%20education">secondary</a> schools. Students get prepared for the <a href="Matura">Matura</a> examination, allowing them to obtain their matura diploma, which grants admission to <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a>. Although, Albania follows the <a href="Bologna%20model">Bologna model</a> in accordance with the 2007 Law on Higher Education. These institutions can be public or private, and may offer one, two or three levels of higher education depending on the institution.

The <a href="school%20life%20expectancy">school life expectancy</a> of Albania is 16 years, ranking 25th in the world. <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20literacy%20rate">Literacy rate</a> in Albania is 99.2% for males and 98.3% for females, having an overall of 98.7%. 

Albania has a <a href="universal%20health%20care">universal health care</a> system run by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Health%20%28Albania%29">Ministry of Health</a>. According to the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>, Albania had the world's 55th <a href="World%20Health%20Organization%20ranking%20of%20health%20systems%20in%202000">best healthcare performance</a> in 2000. The system has been in a steep decline since the <a href="Fall%20of%20communism%20in%20Albania">collapse of communism</a> in the country, but a process of modernization has been taking place since 2000. There were a total of 51 hospitals in 2000 in the country, including a <a href="military%20hospital">military hospital</a> and specialist facilities. The most common causes of death are circulatory diseases followed by cancerous illnesses. <a href="Demographic%20and%20Health%20Surveys">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> completed a survey in April 2009, detailing various health statistics in Albania, including <a href="male%20circumcision">male circumcision</a>, abortion and more. The leading causes of death are cardiovascular disease, trauma, cancer, and respiratory disease. Albania has successfully eradicated diseases such as <a href="malaria">malaria</a>.

<a href="Life%20expectancy">Life expectancy</a> is estimated at 77.8 years (75.1 for males and 80.7 for females), ranking <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20life%20expectancy">thirty-seventh</a> in the world and outperforming a number of <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> countries, such as Slovenia, Estonia, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. Albania's infant mortality rate, estimated at 12 per 1,000 live births in 2015. Compared to other European countries, Albania has a relatively low rate of obesity, probably thanks to the health benefits of the <a href="Mediterranean%20diet">Mediterranean diet</a>.

According to the <a href="Institute%20of%20Statistics%20%28Albania%29">Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)</a> Census of 2011, the total population of Albania was approximately 2,821,977 with a low <a href="Fertility%20rate">Fertility rate</a> of 1.49 children born per woman. The last census, was conducted in 1989.

The <a href="Fall%20of%20communism%20in%20Albania">fall of the Communist regime</a> in 1990, Albania was accompanied with massive migration. External migration was prohibited outright in Communist Albania while internal migration was quite limited, hence this was a new phenomenon. Between 1991 and 2004, roughly 900,000 people have migrated out of Albania, about 600,000 of them settling in <a href="Albanians%20in%20greece">Greece</a>. Migration greatly affected Albania's internal population distribution. Population decreased mainly in the North and South of the country while it increased in <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a> and <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a> center districts. According to the <a href="Institute%20of%20Statistics%20%28Albania%29">Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)</a> as of 1 January 2015, the population of Albania is 2,893,005.

Issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate. Contrary to official statistics that show an over 97 per cent Albanian majority in the country, minority groups (such as <a href="Greeks%20in%20Albania">Greeks</a>, <a href="Macedonians%20in%20Albania">Macedonians</a>, <a href="Montenegrins%20in%20Albania">Montenegrins</a>, <a href="Roma%20in%20Albania">Roma</a> and <a href="Aromanians%20in%20Albania">Aromanians</a>) have frequently disputed the official numbers, asserting a higher percentage of the country's population. According to the disputed 2011 census, ethnic affiliation was as follows: <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a> 2,312,356 (82.6% of the total), <a href="Greeks%20in%20Albania">Greeks</a> 24,243 (0.9%), <a href="Macedonians%20of%20Albania">Macedonians</a> 5,512 (0.2%), <a href="Montenegrins%20of%20Albania">Montenegrins</a> 366 (0.01%), <a href="Aromanians">Aromanians</a> 8,266 (0.30%), <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a> 8,301 (0.3%), <a href="Balkan%20Egyptians">Balkan Egyptians</a> 3,368 (0.1%), other ethnicities 2,644 (0.1%), no declared ethnicity 390,938 (14.0%), and not relevant 44,144 (1.6%). On the quality of the specific data the Advisory Committee on the <a href="Framework%20Convention%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20National%20Minorities">Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities</a> stated that "the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities.‚Äù.

Albania recognizes almost three national minorities, <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>, <a href="Macedonians%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Macedonians</a> and <a href="Montenegrins%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Montenegrins</a>, and two cultural minorities: <a href="Aromanians">Aromanians</a> and <a href="Romani%20people">Romani people</a>. Other Albanian minorities are <a href="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a>, <a href="Gorani%20people">Gorani</a>, <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, <a href="Egyptians%20%28Balkans%29">Balkan Egyptians</a>, <a href="Bosniaks">Bosniaks</a> and <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s. Regarding the Greeks, "it is difficult to know how many Greeks there are in Albania. The Greek government, it is typically claimed, says that there are around 300,000 ethnic Greeks in Albania, but most western estimates are around the 200,000 mark."<ref name="RFE/RL Research Report: Weekly Analyses from the RFE/RL Research Institute"></ref> The Albanian government puts the number at only 24,243." The <a href="CIA%20World%20Factbook">CIA World Factbook</a> estimates the Greek minority at 0.9% of the total population and the US State Department uses 1.17% for Greeks and 0.23% for other minorities. However, the latter questions the validity of the data about the Greek minority, due to the fact that measurements have been affected by boycott. 

Macedonian and some Greek minority groups have sharply criticized Article 20 of the Census law, according to which a $1,000 fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate. This is claimed to be an attempt to intimidate minorities into declaring Albanian ethnicity, according to them the Albanian government has stated that it will jail anyone who does not participate in the census or refuse to declare his or her ethnicity. Genc Pollo, the minister in charge has declared that: "Albanian citizens will be able to freely express their ethnic and religious affiliation and mother tongue. However, they are not forced to answer these sensitive questions". The amendments criticized do not include jailing or forced declaration of ethnicity or religion; only a fine is envisioned which can be overthrown by court.

Greek representatives form part of the Albanian parliament and the government has invited Albanian Greeks to register, as the only way to improve their status. On the other hand, nationalists, various organizations and political parties in Albania have expressed their concern that the census might artificially increase the numbers of the Greek minority, which might be then exploited by Greece to threaten Albania's territorial integrity.

About 53.4% of <a href="Demographics%20of%20Albania">Albania's population</a> living in cities. According the <a href="Institute%20of%20Statistics%20%28Albania%29">Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)</a>, the three largest counties account for half of the population. Over 1 million people lives in the <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a> and <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a>, making it the largest urban area in Albania. The capital <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a>, is one of largest cities in the <a href="Balkan%20Peninsula">Balkan Peninsula</a> and ranks 7th with a population about 800,000.
The second largest is the port city of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a>, with a population of 201.110, followed by <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Vlor√´</a>, the largest city in southern Albania, with 141.513 inhabitants.

<a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a> is the official language of the Republic of Albania. Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, <a href="Gheg">Gheg</a> and <a href="Tosk%20Albanian">Tosk</a>, though it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect. The <a href="Shkumbin">Shkumbin</a> river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects. Also a <a href="Greeks%20in%20Albania%23Language">dialect of Greek</a> that preserves features now lost in standard <a href="modern%20Greek">modern Greek</a> is spoken in areas inhabited by the <a href="Greek%20minority%20in%20Albania">Greek minority</a>. Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include <a href="Aromanian%20language">Aromanian</a>, <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a>, <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a>, <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a>, <a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a>, <a href="Gora%20dialect">Gorani</a>, and <a href="Romani%20language">Roma</a>. Macedonian is official in the Pustec Municipality in East Albania.

<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> is the second most-spoken language in the country, with two thirds of families having at least one member that speaks Greek. La Francophonie states 320,000 French speakers can be found in Albania. Other spoken languages include Italian, English, French, German, and Turkish.

According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610 or 98.767% of the population declared <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a> as their mother tongue ("mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood").

According to the <a href="Institute%20of%20Statistics%20%28Albania%29">Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)</a> Census of 2011, 58.79% of Albanians adhere to <a href="Islam%20in%20Albania">Islam</a>, making it the largest religion in the country; <a href="Christianity%20in%20Albania">Christianity</a> is practiced by 17.06% of the population, and 24.29% of the total population is either non-religious, belongs to other religious groups, or are 'undeclared'. Both the Albanian Orthodox church and the <a href="Bektashi%20order">Bektashi Sufi order</a> refused to recognize the 2011 census results regarding faith, with the Orthodox claiming that 24% of the total population are Albanian Orthodox Christians rather than just 6.75%. Before World War II, 70% of the population were Muslims, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholics. According to a 2010 survey, religion today plays an important role in the lives of only 39% of Albanians, and Albania is ranked among the least religious countries in the world. A 2012 Pew Research Center study found that 65% of Albanian Muslims are <a href="non-denominational%20Muslims">non-denominational Muslims</a>. According to 2008 statistics from the religious communities in Albania, there are 1119 churches and 638 mosques in the country. The Catholics declared 694 churches, the Orthodox 425 churches, the Muslim community 568 mosques and the Bektashi 70 tekkes.

Albania is one of the most ancient countries of <a href="Christianity%20in%20Albania">Christianity</a>. There are thought to have been about seventy Christian families in the port town of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a> as early as the time of the Apostles. The Archbishopric of Durr√´s was purportedly founded by the apostle Paul while preaching in Illyria and Epirus.<a href="http%3A//biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/10-3_242.pdf"></a> The Albanians first appeared in the historical record in <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. <a href="Islam">Islam</a> came for the first time in the 9th century to the region which is known as Albania today. It later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories.

The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely <a href="anti-religious">banned religion</a> to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first <a href="atheist%20state">atheist state</a>. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the <a href="Organisation%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Conference">Organisation of the Islamic Conference</a> in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but did not attend the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> branch) are found throughout the country whereas <a href="Albanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Albanian Orthodox Christians</a> as well as <a href="Bektashi">Bektashi</a>s are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country.

The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the <a href="British%20and%20Foreign%20Bible%20Society">British and Foreign Bible Society</a> in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990. <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>, <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, and <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> also have a number of adherents in Albania.

Albania was the only country in Europe where <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> population experienced growth during <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. After the mass emigration to Israel since the fall of Communist regime, only 200 <a href="Judaism%20in%20Albania">Albanian Jews</a> are left in the country today.

Due to its long history, Albania is home to many valuable cultural and historical landmarks. From antiquity to the modern period, major cities in the country have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings, religious, and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques.

Albania is host to three <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Albania">World Heritage Sites</a>, including the ancient remains of <a href="Butrint">Butrint</a> in the south of <a href="Sarand%C3%AB">Sarand√´</a>, the medieval <a href="Historic%20Centres%20of%20Berat%20and%20Gjirokast%C3%ABr">Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokast√´r</a>, and <a href="Gashi%20River">Gashi River</a> and <a href="Rrajc%C3%AB">Rrajc√´</a>, which is part of the <a href="Shebenik-Jabllanice%20National%20Park">Shebenik-Jabllanice National Park</a> under the <a href="Primeval%20Beech%20Forests%20of%20the%20Carpathians%20and%20Other%20Regions%20of%20Europe">Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe</a>. Further, the <a href="Natural%20and%20Cultural%20Heritage%20of%20the%20Ohrid%20Region%20%28Albania%29">natural and cultural heritage</a> of Ohrid, the royal <a href="Royal%20Tombs%20of%20Selca%20e%20Poshtme">Illyrian tombs</a> of Selca e Poshtme, the remains of <a href="Apollonia%20%28Illyria%29">Apollonia</a>, the ancient <a href="Durr%C3%ABs%20Amphitheatre">Amphitheatre</a> of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a> and the <a href="Fortress%20of%20Bashtov%C3%AB">Fortress of Bashtov√´</a> has been included on the tentative list.

Many ancient architectural treasures from the <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> such as <a href="Byllis">Byllis</a>, <a href="Amantia">Amantia</a>, <a href="Phoenice">Phoenice</a> and <a href="Rozafa%20Castle">Shkod√´r</a> can be found in Albania. Due to the long period of rule of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, Albania is home to many Byzantine churches, castles, and monasteries. Albania also host many surviving monuments from the five centuries of Ottoman rule. In the 19th century, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by Austro-Hungarian and Italian architects, giving them the appearance of European cities. During the <a href="Peoples%20Republic%20of%20Albania">communism</a>, many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads, and factories were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and a number of historic buildings demolished.

The <a href="Albanian%20music">folk music</a> of Albania falls into two major groups, such as the northern <a href="Gheg%20Albanian">Gheg</a>s and southern <a href="Lab%C3%ABria">Lab</a>s and <a href="Tosk%20Albanian">Tosk</a>s. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the rugged and heroic tone of the north and the relaxed form of the south. The <a href="Gheg%20Albanian">Gheg</a>s are known for a distinctive variety of sung epic poetry. Many of the songs are about the ancient history of the <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a> but also the national hero <a href="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a>, who led the struggle against the Ottomans, and the constant Albanian themes of honour, hospitality, treachery and revenge. <a href="Tosk%20Albanian">Tosk</a> music is soft and gentle, and <a href="Polyphony">polyphonic</a> in nature. The southern corner of Albania is also known for funeral laments with a chorus and one to two soloists with overlapping, mournful voices. Its instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven by a <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a> or <a href="violin">violin</a> alongside accordions and <a href="lahuta">lahuta</a>. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as "both fresh and ancient", "ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality", exemplifying the "combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture".

These disparate styles are unified by the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of <a href="oral%20history">oral history</a>, as well as certain characteristics like the use of rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8. The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two <a href="Himara">Himariot</a> song artists <a href="Ne%C3%A7o%20Muko">Ne√ßo Muka</a> and Ko√ßo √áakali in 1929 and 1931 in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> during their interpretations with the Albanian song diva Tefta Tashko Ko√ßo. Several gramophone compilations were recorded in those years by this genial trio of Albanian artists which eventually led to the recognition of the Himariot Isopolyphonic Music as an <a href="List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Albania">UNESCO World Heritage</a>.

The contemporary music artists <a href="Ermonela%20Jaho">Ermonela Jaho</a>, <a href="Inva%20Mula">Inva Mula</a>, <a href="Bebe%20Rexha">Bebe Rexha</a>, <a href="Rita%20Ora">Rita Ora</a> and <a href="Era%20Istrefi">Era Istrefi</a>, have achieved international recognition for their music. Sporano <a href="Ermonela%20Jaho">Ermonela Jaho</a> has been described by <a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a> as "the world‚Äôs most acclaimed soprano". One widely recognised musician from <a href="Elbasan">Elbasan</a> is <a href="Saimir%20Pirgu">Saimir Pirgu</a>, an Albanian international opera singer. He was nominated for the 2017 <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> in the category of "Best Opera Recording".

Almost each cultural and geographical region has its own specific variety of costume that vary in style, material, color, shape, detail and form. Presently, the national costumes are most often worn with connection to special events and celebrations, mostly at ethnic festivals, religious holidays, weddings, and by dancing groups. Some conservative old men and women mainly from the high Northern as well as Southern Lands and wear traditional clothing in their daily lives. The clothing was made mainly of products from the local agriculture and livestock such as leather, wool, linen, hemp fiber and silk. Today, the Albanian traditional textiles are still embroidered in very claborate ancient patterns. Among the most important parts of clothing includes the <a href="Qeleshe">Plis</a>, <a href="Albanian%20hat">Albanian hat</a>, Qylaf√´, <a href="Fustanella">Fustanella</a>, <a href="Xhubleta">Xhubleta</a>, <a href="Xhamadan">Xhamadan</a>, <a href="Brez%20%28clothing%29">Brez</a>, <a href="%C3%87orape">√áorape</a>, <a href="Opinga">Opinga</a> and others.

The <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian language</a> comprises its own branch of the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European language</a> family. The language is considered an <a href="Language%20isolate">isolate</a> within the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a>. The only other languages that are the sole surviving member of a branch of <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> are Armenian and Greek. It was proved to be an <a href="Indo-European%20language">Indo-European language</a> in 1854 by the German <a href="Comparative%20linguistics">philologist</a> <a href="Franz%20Bopp">Franz Bopp</a>. Albanian is often held to be related to the <a href="Illyrian%20languages">Illyrian languages</a>, a language spoken in the Balkans during <a href="Classical%20antiquity">classical times</a>. Scholars argue that Albanian derives from <a href="Illyrian%20language">Illyrian</a> while some others claim that it derives from <a href="Dacian%20language">Daco</a>-<a href="Thracian%20language">Thracian</a>. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see <a href="Thraco-Illyrian">Thraco-Illyrian</a>.)

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian language</a> in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the northern of Albania, but also of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> in the south. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric <a href="Gjon%20Buzuku">Gjon Buzuku</a> brought into the Albanian language the <a href="Catholic%20liturgy">Catholic liturgy</a>, trying to do for the Albanian language, what <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> did for the <a href="German%20language">German language</a>. <a href="Meshari">Meshari</a> ("The Missal") written by <a href="Gjon%20Buzuku">Gjon Buzuku</a> was published in 1555 and is considered as one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.
The earliest evidence dates from 1332¬†AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, <a href="Archbishop">Archbishop</a> of <a href="Antivari">Antivari</a>, who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a <a href="Formula%20e%20pag%C3%ABzimit">baptism formula</a> ("Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit") from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durr√´s</a>, <a href="Pal%20Engj%C3%ABlli">Pal Engj√´lli</a>; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.

Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist <a href="Marin%20Barleti">Marin Barleti</a>, who in his book <a href="Siege%20of%20Shkodra%20%281478%29%23The%20Book">Siege of Shkod√´r</a> ("Rrethimi i Shkodr√´s") from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people ("in vernacula lingua") as well as his famous biography of <a href="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a> <a href="Marin%20Barleti">Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis</a> ("History of Skanderbeg") from 1508. The "History of Skanderbeg" is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.

During the 16th and the 17th centuries, the <a href="catechism">catechism</a> ("E mb√´suame krishter√´") (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by <a href="Lek%C3%AB%20Matr%C3%ABnga">Lek√´ Matr√´nga</a>, ("Doktrina e krishter√´") (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and ("Rituale romanum") 1621 by <a href="Pjet%C3%ABr%20Budi">Pjet√´r Budi</a>, the first writer of original Albanian <a href="prose">prose</a> and poetry, an <a href="Remorse">apology</a> for George Castriot (1636) by <a href="Frang%20Bardhi">Frang Bardhi</a>, who also published a dictionary and <a href="folklore">folklore</a> creations, the theological-philosophical treaty "<a href="Cuneus%20Prophetarum">Cuneus Prophetarum</a>" (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by <a href="Pjet%C3%ABr%20Bogdani">Pjet√´r Bogdani</a>, the most universal personality of Albanian <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, were published in <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a>. The most famous Albanian writer in the 20th and 21th century is probably <a href="Ismail%20Kadare">Ismail Kadare</a>. He has been mentioned as a possible recipient of the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> in Literature several times.

The <a href="visual%20art">visual art</a>s tradition of Albania has been shaped by the many cultures, which have flourished on its territory. Once the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a>s, the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a>s ruled over Albania for nearly five centuries, which greatly affected the country's artwork and artistic forms. After Albania's joining with the Ottoman Empire in 1478, Ottoman influenced art forms such as mosaics and mural paintings became prevalent, and no real artistic change occurred until the <a href="Albanian%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">independence</a> in 1912.

Following mosaics and murals from antiquity and the middle mges, the first paintings were icons Byzantine Orthodox tradition. Albanian earliest icons date from the late thirteenth century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the eighteenth century. Among the most prominent representatives of the Albanian iconographic art were <a href="Onufri">Onufri</a> and <a href="David%20Selenica">David Selenica</a>. The museums of <a href="Berat">Berat</a>, <a href="Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB">Kor√ß√´</a> and <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a> houses good collections remaining icons. By the end of the Ottoman period, the painting was limited mostly to folk art and ornate mosques. Paintings and sculpture arose in the first half of the twentieth century and reached a modest peak in the 1930s and 1940s, when the first organized art exhibitions at national level. Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content. Though among Albanian artist post-modernism was fairly recently introduced, there is a number of artists and works known internationally. Among the most prominent Albanian post-modernist are considered <a href="Anri%20Sala">Anri Sala</a>, <a href="Sislej%20Xhafa">Sislej Xhafa</a>, and <a href="Helidon%20Gjergji">Helidon Gjergji</a>. 

The Cuisine of Albania¬†‚Äì as with most <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> and <a href="Balkans">Balkan</a> nations¬†‚Äì is strongly influenced by its long history. At different times, the territory which is now Albania has been claimed or occupied by <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a>, Byzantine and the <a href="Ottoman%20Turk">Ottoman Turk</a>s and each group has left its mark on Albanian cuisine.

The main meal of <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a> is the midday meal, which is usually accompanied by a <a href="salad">salad</a> of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, <a href="cucumber">cucumber</a>s, green <a href="bell%20pepper">peppers</a> and <a href="olive">olive</a>s with <a href="olive%20oil">olive oil</a>, vinegar and salt.

In high elevation localities, smoked meat and pickled preserves are common.

The history of <a href="Cinema%20of%20Albania">Cinema in Albania</a> dates back to 1911 and 1912 with the first showings of foreign films and few documentaries in the pre-war and inter-war period. The first public showing to occur in Albania was a little-known title, "Paddy the Reliable", a comical story.

Allah

Allah (; , ) is the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> word for <a href="God%20in%20Abrahamic%20religions">God in Abrahamic religions</a>. In the English language, the word generally refers to <a href="God%20in%20Islam">God in Islam</a>. The word is thought to be derived by <a href="Contraction%20%28grammar%29">contraction</a> from "<a href="Arabic%20definite%20article">al</a>-<a href="Ilah">ilƒÅh</a>", which means "the god", and is related to "<a href="El%20%28deity%29">El</a>" and "<a href="Elohim">Elohim</a>", the <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew words</a> for God.

The word "Allah" has been used by <a href="Arabs">Arabic people</a> of different religions since <a href="pre-Islamic%20Arabia">pre-Islamic</a> times. More specifically, it has been used as a term for God by <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s (both <a href="Arab%20Muslims">Arab</a> and non-Arab) and <a href="Arab%20Christians">Arab Christians</a>. It is also often, albeit not exclusively, used in this way by <a href="B%C3%A1bism">B√°bists</a>, <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bah√°'√≠s</a>, <a href="Christianity%20in%20Indonesia">Indonesian</a> and <a href="Christianity%20in%20Malta">Maltese</a> Christians, and <a href="Mizrahi%20Jews">Mizrahi Jews</a>. Similar usage by Christians and <a href="Sikhs">Sikhs</a> in <a href="West%20Malaysia">West Malaysia</a> has recently led to political and legal controversies.

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the word "AllƒÅh" has been discussed extensively by classical Arab philologists. Grammarians of the <a href="Hasan%20of%20Basra">Basra school</a> regarded it as either formed "spontaneously" ("murtajal") or as the definite form of "lƒÅh" (from the verbal root "lyh" with the meaning of "lofty" or "hidden"). Others held that it was borrowed from Syriac or Hebrew, but most considered it to be derived from a <a href="Synalepha">contraction</a> of the Arabic definite article "<a href="al-">al-</a>" "the" and ' "<a href="deity">deity</a>, god" to ' meaning "the deity", or "the God". The majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory, and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism.

<a href="Cognates">Cognates</a> of the name "AllƒÅh" exist in other <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic languages</a>, including <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> and <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a>. The corresponding <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> form is "Elah" (), but its emphatic state is "Elaha" (). It is written as (" ºƒîlƒÅhƒÅ") in <a href="Biblical%20Aramaic">Biblical Aramaic</a> and (" ºAl√¢h√¢") in <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> as used by the <a href="Assyrian%20Christians">Assyrian Church</a>, both meaning simply "God". <a href="Biblical%20Hebrew">Biblical Hebrew</a> mostly uses the plural (but functional singular) form "<a href="Elohim">Elohim</a>" (), but more rarely it also uses the singular form "Eloah" ().

Regional variants of the word "Allah" occur in both pagan and Christian pre-Islamic inscriptions. Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in pre-Islamic <a href="Polytheism">polytheistic cults</a>. Some authors have suggested that polytheistic Arabs used the name as a reference to a <a href="creator%20god">creator god</a> or a supreme deity of their <a href="Pantheon%20%28religion%29">pantheon</a>. The term may have been vague in the <a href="Mecca">Meccan religion</a>. According to one hypothesis, which goes back to <a href="Julius%20Wellhausen">Julius Wellhausen</a>, Allah (the supreme deity of the tribal federation around <a href="Quraysh">Quraysh</a>) was a designation that consecrated the superiority of <a href="Hubal">Hubal</a> (the supreme deity of Quraysh) over the other gods. However, there is also evidence that Allah and Hubal were two distinct deities. According to that hypothesis, the <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a> was first consecrated to a supreme deity named Allah and then hosted the pantheon of Quraysh after their conquest of Mecca, about a century before the time of Muhammad. Some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of Allah as a name of a polytheist deity centuries earlier, but we know nothing precise about this use. Some scholars have suggested that Allah may have represented a remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities. There is disagreement on whether Allah played a major role in the Meccan religious cult. No iconic representation of Allah is known to have existed. <a href="Abd%20Allah%20ibn%20Abd%20al%20Muttalib">Muhammad's father's</a> name was meaning "the slave of AllƒÅh".

The <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> word for "God" in the language of <a href="Assyrian%20Christians">Assyrian Christians</a> is " ºƒîlƒÅhƒÅ", or "Alaha". <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>-speakers of all Abrahamic faiths, including Christians and Jews, use the word "Allah" to mean "God". The Christian Arabs of today have no other word for "God" than "Allah". (Even the Arabic-descended <a href="Maltese%20language">Maltese language</a> of <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, whose population is almost entirely Roman Catholic, uses "Alla" for "God".) Arab Christians, for example, use the terms ' () for <a href="God%20the%20Father">God the Father</a>, ' () for <a href="Son%20of%20God">God the Son</a>, and "" () for <a href="Holy%20Spirit%20in%20Christianity">God the Holy Spirit</a>. (See <a href="God%20in%20Christianity">God in Christianity</a> for the Christian concept of God.)

<a href="Arab%20Christians">Arab Christians</a> have used two forms of invocations that were <a href="affix">affix</a>ed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim ', and also created their own <a href="Trinity">Trinitized</a> ' as early as the 8th century. The Muslim ' reads: "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful." The Trinitized ' reads: "In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God." The <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a>, <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> invocations do not have the words "One God" at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the <a href="monotheism">monotheistic</a> aspect of Trinitarian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims.

According to <a href="Marshall%20Hodgson">Marshall Hodgson</a>, it seems that in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made pilgrimage to the <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.

Some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient <a href="pre-Islamic%20Arabia">pre-Islamic</a> inscriptions and tombs made by <a href="Arab%20Christians">Arab Christians</a> in the ruins of a church at <a href="Umm%20el-Jimal">Umm el-Jimal</a> in Northern <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, which contained references to Allah as the proper name of God, and some of the graves contained names such as "Abd Allah" which means "the servant/slave of Allah".

The name Allah can be found countless times in the reports and the lists of names of Christian martyrs in South Arabia, as reported by antique Syriac documents of the names of those martyrs from the era of the <a href="Himyarite">Himyarite</a> and <a href="Aksumite">Aksumite</a> kingdoms.

A Christian leader named Abd Allah ibn Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad was martyred in Najran in 523, as he had worn a ring that said "Allah is my lord".

In an inscription of Christian martyrion dated back to 512, references to Allah can be found in both Arabic and Aramaic, which called him "Allah" and "Alaha", and the inscription starts with the statement "By the Help of Allah".

In pre-Islamic Gospels, the name used for God was "Allah", as evidenced by some discovered Arabic versions of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> written by <a href="Arab%20Christians">Arab Christians</a> during the pre-Islamic era in Northern and Southern <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a>.

Pre-Islamic Arab Christians have been reported to have raised the battle cry ""Ya La Ibad Allah"" (O slaves of Allah) to invoke each other into battle.

"Allah" was also mentioned in pre-Islamic Christian poems by some <a href="Ghassanid">Ghassanid</a> and <a href="Tanukhids">Tanukhid</a> poets in <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and Northern <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a>.

In Islam, "Allah" is the unique, omnipotent and only deity and <a href="Creator%20deity">creator of the universe</a> and is equivalent to <a href="God%20in%20Abrahamic%20religions">God in other Abrahamic religions</a>.

According to Islamic belief, Allah is the most common word to represent God, and humble submission to his will, divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith. "He is the only God, creator of the universe, and the judge of humankind." "He is unique (') and inherently one ('), all-merciful and omnipotent." The Qur'an declares "the reality of Allah, His inaccessible mystery, His various names, and His actions on behalf of His creatures."

In Islamic tradition, there are <a href="99%20Names%20of%20God">99 Names of God</a> ("" lit. meaning: 'the best names' or 'the most beautiful names'), each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of Allah. All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name. Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are "the Merciful" ("<a href="Rahman%20%28name%29">al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn</a>") and "the Compassionate" ("").

Most Muslims use the untranslated Arabic phrase "<a href="Insha%27Allah"></a>" (meaning 'if God wills') after references to future events. Muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of "<a href="Basmala"></a>" (meaning 'in the name of God').

There are certain phrases in praise of God that are favored by Muslims, including "<a href="subhan%27allah">Sub·∏•ƒÅn AllƒÅh</a>" (Holiness be to God), "<a href="Alhamdulillah">al-·∏•amdu lillƒÅh</a>" (Praise be to God), "<a href="Shahada"></a>" (There is no deity but God) and "<a href="Takbir">AllƒÅhu akbar</a>" (God is greater) as a devotional exercise of remembering God (<a href="dhikr">dhikr</a>). In a <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> practice known as "dhikr Allah" (lit. remembrance of God), the Sufi repeats and contemplates on the name "Allah" or other divine names while controlling his or her breath.

Some scholars have suggested that Mu·∏•ammad used the term "Allah" in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians in order to establish a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard B√∂wering says is doubtful. According to B√∂wering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian <a href="polytheism">polytheism</a>, God in Islam does not have associates and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and <a href="jinn">jinn</a>. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.

According to <a href="Francis%20Edwards%20Peters">Francis Edwards Peters</a>, "The <a href="Quran">Qur‚ÄôƒÅn</a> insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and his followers worship the same God as the Jews (). The Qur‚Äôan's Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>". Peters states that the Qur'an portrays Allah as both more powerful and more remote than <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, and as a universal deity, unlike Yahweh who closely follows <a href="Israel">Israel</a>ites.

The history of the name "AllƒÅh" in English was probably influenced by the study of <a href="comparative%20religion">comparative religion</a> in the 19th century; for example, <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a> (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Mu·∏•ammad (1934), <a href="Tor%20Andr%C3%A6">Tor Andr√¶</a> always used the term "Allah", though he allows that this "conception of God" seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies.

Languages which may not commonly use the term "Allah" to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long <a href="Al-Andalus">Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula</a>, the word "ojal√°" in the Spanish language and "oxal√°" in the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese language</a> exist today, borrowed from <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> (Arabic: ÿ•ŸÜ ÿ¥ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá). This phrase literally means 'if God wills' (in the sense of "I hope so"). The German poet <a href="Siegfried%20August%20Mahlmann">Mahlmann</a> used the form "Allah" as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity, though it is unclear how much Islamic thought he intended to convey.

Some Muslims leave the name "AllƒÅh" untranslated in English. The word has also been applied to certain living human beings as <a href="Anthropomorphism">personifications</a> of the term and concept.

Christians in Malaysia and Indonesia use "Allah" to refer to God in the <a href="Malaysian%20language">Malaysian</a> and <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian language</a>s (both of which are standardized forms of the <a href="Malay%20language">Malay language</a>.) Mainstream Bible translations in the language use "Allah" as the translation of Hebrew <a href="Elohim">Elohim</a> (translated in English Bibles as "God"). This goes back to early translation work by <a href="Francis%20Xavier">Francis Xavier</a> in the 16th century. The first dictionary of Dutch-Malay by Albert Cornelius Ruyl, Justus Heurnius, and Caspar Wiltens in 1650 (revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 Latin-edition) recorded "Allah" as the translation of the Dutch word "". Ruyl also translated <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Matthew</a> in 1612 to Malay language (first Bible translation to non-European language, only a year after <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> was published), which was printed in the Netherlands in 1629. Then he translated <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Mark</a> which was published in 1638.

The <a href="government%20of%20Malaysia">government of Malaysia</a> in 2007 outlawed usage of the term "Allah" in any other but Muslim contexts, but the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Malaya">Malayan High Court</a> in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional. While "Allah" had been used for the Christian God in Malay for more than four centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of "Allah" by the Roman Catholic newspaper "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Malaysian%20Catholic%20Weekly%29">The Herald</a>". The government appealed the court ruling, and the High Court suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal was heard. In October 2013, the court ruled in favor of the government's ban. In early 2014, the Malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for using the word to refer to the Christian God in Peninsular Malaysia. However, the use of Allah is not prohibited in the two Malaysian state of <a href="Sabah">Sabah</a> and <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a>. The main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long-established and local Alkitab (<a href="Bibles">Bibles</a>) have been widely distributed freely in East Malaysia without restrictions for years. Both states also do not have similar Islamic state laws as those in West Malaysia.

As a reaction to some media criticism, the Malaysian government has introduced a "10-point solution" to avoid confusion and misleading information. The 10-point solution is in line with the spirit of the <a href="18-point%20agreement">18</a>- and <a href="20-point%20agreement">20-point agreement</a>s of Sarawak and Sabah.
"" in other languages that use Arabic script is spelled in the same way. This includes <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>/<a href="Dari%20%28Eastern%20Persian%29">Dari</a>, <a href="Uyghur%20language">Uyghur</a> among others.

The word ' is always written without an <a href="aleph"></a> to spell the ' vowel. This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using ' to spell '. However, in vocalized spelling, a small diacritic "" is added on top of the "<a href="shadda"></a>" to indicate the pronunciation.

One exception may be in the pre-Islamic <a href="History%20of%20the%20Arabic%20alphabet%23Pre-Islamic%20Arabic%20inscriptions">Zabad inscription</a>, where it ends with an ambiguous sign that may be a lone-standing "h" with a lengthened start, or may be a non-standard conjoined ":-

Many Arabic type fonts feature special <a href="typographic%20ligature">ligatures</a> for Allah.

<a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> has a codepoint reserved for ', = U+FDF2, in the <a href="Arabic%20Presentation%20Forms-A">Arabic Presentation Forms-A</a> block, which exists solely for "compatibility with some older, legacy character sets that encoded presentation forms directly"; this is discouraged for new text. Instead, the word ' should be represented by its individual Arabic letters, while modern font technologies will render the desired ligature.

The calligraphic variant of the word used as the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Iran">Coat of arms of Iran</a> is encoded in Unicode, in the <a href="Miscellaneous%20Symbols">Miscellaneous Symbols</a> range, at codepoint U+262B (‚ò´).

Azerbaijan

Azerbaijan ( ; , officially the Republic of Azerbaijan ()), is a country in the <a href="South%20Caucasus">South Caucasus</a> region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bound by the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> to the east, <a href="Russia">Russia</a> to the north, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> to the northwest, <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> to the west and <a href="Iran">Iran</a> to the south. The <a href="exclave">exclave</a> of <a href="Nakhchivan%20Autonomous%20Republic">Nakhchivan</a> is bound by <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> to the north and east, <a href="Iran">Iran</a> to the south and west, while having an 11¬†km border with <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> in the north west.

The <a href="Azerbaijan%20Democratic%20Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a> proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became the first democratic state in the Muslim-oriented world. The country was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920 as the <a href="Azerbaijan%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic</a>. The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991, prior to the official <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the USSR</a> in December 1991. In September 1991, the Armenian majority of the disputed <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> region seceded to form the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20Republic">Nagorno-Karabakh Republic</a>. The region and <a href="Armenian-controlled%20territories%20surrounding%20Nagorno-Karabakh">seven adjacent districts outside it</a> became "de facto" independent with the end of the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">Nagorno-Karabakh War</a> in 1994. These regions are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh, found through negotiations facilitated by the <a href="OSCE">OSCE</a>.

Azerbaijan is a unitary <a href="Semi-presidential%20system">semi-presidential</a> republic. The country is a member state of the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>, the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">OSCE</a> and the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> <a href="Partnership%20for%20Peace">Partnership for Peace</a> (PfP) program. It is one of six independent <a href="List%20of%20Turkic%20dynasties%20and%20countries%23Current%20independent%20states">Turkic states</a>, an active member of the <a href="Turkic%20Council">Turkic Council</a> and the <a href="International%20Organization%20of%20Turkic%20Culture">T√úRKSOY</a> community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries and holds membership in 38 international organizations. It is one of the founding members of <a href="GUAM%20Organization%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Economic%20Development">GUAM</a>, the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a> (CIS) and the <a href="Organization%20for%20the%20Prohibition%20of%20Chemical%20Weapons">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a>. A member of the United Nations since 1992 after its independence, Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established <a href="Human%20Rights%20Council">Human Rights Council</a> by the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> on 9 May 2006. Its term of office began on 19 June 2006. Azerbaijan is also a member state of the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>, holds observer status in <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a>, and is a correspondent at the <a href="International%20Telecommunication%20Union">International Telecommunication Union</a>.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Azerbaijan">Constitution of Azerbaijan</a> does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are <a href="secularism">secularist</a>. However, the majority of the population are of a Shiite Muslim background. Most Azerbaijanis, however, do not actively practice any religion, and the country has been seen to be one of the most <a href="Irreligion%20in%20Azerbaijan">irreligious</a> countries in the Muslim world, with 53% stating religion has little to no importance in their lives, according to <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a> and <a href="Gallup%20%28company%29">Gallup</a> polls. Azerbaijan has a high level of <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">human development</a> which ranks on par with most Eastern European countries. It has a high rate of <a href="economic%20development">economic development</a> and <a href="literacy%20rate">literacy</a>, as well as a low rate of <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20unemployment%20rate">unemployment</a>. However, the ruling party, the <a href="New%20Azerbaijan%20Party">New Azerbaijan Party</a>, has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights abuses.

According to a modern etymology, the name of Azerbaijan derives from that of "<a href="Atropates">Atropates</a>", a <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> <a href="satrap">satrap</a> under the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, who was later reinstated as the satrap of <a href="Medes">Media</a> under <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. The original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once-dominant <a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>. In the <a href="Avesta">Avesta</a>, Frawardin <a href="Yasht">Yasht</a> ("Hymn to the Guardian Angels"), there is a mention of "√¢terep√¢tahe ashaon√¥ fravash√Æm √Ωazamaide", which literally translates from <a href="Avestan">Avestan</a> as "we worship the <a href="fravashi">fravashi</a> of the holy <a href="Atropatene">Atropatene</a>." The name "Atropates" itself is the Greek transliteration of an Old Iranian, probably <a href="Median%20language">Median</a>, compounded name with the meaning "Protected by the (Holy) Fire" or "The Land of the (Holy) Fire". The Greek name was mentioned by <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>. Over the span of millennia the name evolved to "ƒÄturpƒÅtƒÅkƒÅn" (Middle Persian) then to "ƒÄdharbƒÅdhagƒÅn", "ƒÄdharbƒÅyagƒÅn", "ƒÄzarbƒÅydjƒÅn" (New Persian) and present-day "Azerbaijan".

In 1918, the government of <a href="Musavat">Musavat</a> adopted the name "Azerbaijan" for the new <a href="Azerbaijan%20Democratic%20Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a>, which was proclaimed on 28 May 1918, for political reasons, even though the name of "Azerbaijan" had always been used to refer to the <a href="Azerbaijan%20%28Iran%29">adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran</a>. Thus, until 1918, when the Musavat regime decided to name the newly-independent state Azerbaijan, the designation had been used exclusively to identify the Iranian province of Azerbaijan.

During Soviet rule, the country was also spelled in English from the Russian transliteration as ""Azerbaydzhan"".

The earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> and is related to the <a href="Guruchay%20culture">Guruchay culture</a> of <a href="Azokh%20Cave">Azokh Cave</a>. The <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a> and late <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> cultures are attested in the caves of <a href="Ta%C4%9F%C4%B1lar">Taƒüƒ±lar</a>, <a href="Damc%C4%B1l%C4%B1">Damcƒ±lƒ±</a>, <a href="Zar%2C%20Azerbaijan">Zar</a>, Yataq-yeri and in the <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a>es of Leylatepe and Saraytepe.

Early settlements included the <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>ns in the 9th century BC. Following the Scythians, Iranian <a href="Medes">Medes</a> came to dominate the area to the south of the <a href="Aras%20%28river%29">Aras</a>. The Medes forged a vast empire between 900‚Äì700¬†BC, which was integrated into the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> around 550¬†BC. The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of <a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>. Later it became part of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>'s <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Empire</a> and its successor, the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>. During this period, Zoroastrianism spread in the Caucasus and Atropatene. <a href="Caucasian%20Albania">Caucasian Albania</a>ns, the original inhabitants of northeastern Azerbaijan, ruled that area from around the 4th century BC, and established an independent kingdom.

The <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a> turned <a href="Caucasian%20Albania">Caucasian Albania</a> into a <a href="vassal%20state">vassal state</a> in 252, while King <a href="Urnayr">Urnayr</a> officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule, Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy. Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian <a href="marzban">marzban</a> (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.

In the first half of the 7th century, Caucasian Albania, as a vassal of the Sasanians, came under nominal Muslim rule due to the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Persia">Muslim conquest of Persia</a>. The <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> repulsed both the Sasanians and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a> from <a href="Transcaucasia">Transcaucasia</a> and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King <a href="Javanshir">Javanshir</a>, was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a> was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the <a href="Sallarid%20dynasty">Sallarids</a>, <a href="Sajid%20dynasty">Sajids</a>, <a href="Shaddadids">Shaddadids</a>, <a href="Rawadid%20dynasty">Rawadids</a> and <a href="Buyid%20dynasty">Buyids</a>. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of <a href="Oghuz%20Turks">Oghuz Turks</a> from <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the <a href="Seljuk%20Empire">Seljuk Empire</a>, who entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.

The pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijan spoke several Indo-European and Caucasian languages, among them <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a> and an <a href="Iranian%20languages">Iranian language</a>, <a href="Old%20Azeri%20language">Old Azeri</a>, which was gradually replaced by a <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic language</a>, the early precursor of the <a href="Azerbaijani%20language">Azerbaijani language</a> of today. Some linguists have also stated that the <a href="Tat%20language%20%28Caucasus%29">Tati dialects</a> of <a href="Azerbaijan%20%28Iran%29">Iranian Azerbaijan</a> and the Republic of Azerbaijan, like those spoken by the <a href="Tat%20people%20%28Caucasus%29">Tats</a>, are descended from Old Azeri. Locally, the possessions of the subsequent Seljuk Empire were ruled by <a href="Eldiguzids">Eldiguzids</a>, technically vassals of the Seljuk sultans, but sometimes "de facto" rulers themselves. Under the Seljuks, local poets such as <a href="Nizami%20Ganjavi">Nizami Ganjavi</a> and <a href="Khaqani">Khaqani</a> gave rise to a blossoming of <a href="Persian%20literature">Persian literature</a> on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan.

The next ruling state, the <a href="Jalairid%20Sultanate">Jalairid Sultanate</a>, was short-lived and fell as a conquest of <a href="Timur">Timur</a>.

The local dynasty of the <a href="Shirvanshah">Shirvanshah</a>s became a <a href="vassal">vassal</a> state of <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timur's Empire</a>, and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a> <a href="Tokhtamysh">Tokhtamysh</a>. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival states emerged: <a href="Kara%20Koyunlu">Kara Koyunlu</a> and <a href="Aq%20Qoyunlu">Aq Qoyunlu</a>. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861, for numerous centuries to come. In 1501, the <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid dynasty</a> of Iran subdued the Shirvanshahs, and gained its possessions. In the course of the next century, the Safavids <a href="Safavid%20conversion%20of%20Iran%20to%20Shia%20Islam">converted the formerly Sunni population to Shia Islam</a>, as they did with the population in what is modern-day Iran. The Safavids allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty, until 1538, when Safavid king <a href="Tahmasp%20I">Tahmasp I</a> (r. 1524-1576) completely deposed them, and made the area into the Safavid province of <a href="Safavid%20Shirvan">Shirvan</a>. The Sunni Ottomans briefly managed to occupy parts of present-day Azerbaijan as a result of the <a href="Ottoman-Safavid%20War%20%281578-1590%29">Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590</a>; by the early 17th century, they were ousted by Safavid Iranian ruler <a href="Abbas%20I%20of%20Persia">Abbas I</a> (r. 1588-1629). In the wake of the demise of the Safavid Empire, Baku and its environs were briefly occupied by the Russians as a consequence of the <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281722%E2%80%9323%29">Russo-Persian War of 1722-1723</a>. Despite brief intermissions such as these by Safavid Iran's neighboring rivals, the land of what is today Azerbaijan remained under Iranian rule from the earliest advent of the Safavids up to the course of the 19th century.

After the <a href="Safavid">Safavid</a>s, the area was ruled by the Iranian <a href="Afsharid%20dynasty">Afsharid dynasty</a>. After the death of <a href="Nader%20Shah">Nader Shah</a> (r. 1736-1747), many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability. Numerous self-ruling <a href="Khanates%20of%20the%20Caucasus">khanate</a>s with various forms of autonomy emerged in the area. These rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of Iran, and were <a href="vassals">vassals</a> and <a href="Commoners">subjects</a> of the Iranian shah. The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West.

Thereafter, the area was under the successive rule of the Iranian <a href="Zand%20dynasty">Zand</a>s and <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Qajars</a>. From the late 18th century, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south, namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire. Russia now actively tried to gain possession of the Caucasus region which was, for the most part, in the hands of Iran. In 1804, the Russians <a href="Battle%20of%20Ganja%20%281804%29">invaded and sacked the Iranian town of Ganja</a>, sparking the <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281804%E2%80%9313%29">Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813</a>. Militarily superior, the Russians ended the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813 with a victory.
Following Qajar Iran's loss in the 1804‚Äì1813 war, it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates, along with Georgia and Dagestan to the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, per the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Gulistan">Treaty of Gulistan</a>.

The area to the north of the river <a href="Aras%20River">Aras</a>, amongst which territory lies the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, was Iranian territory until it was occupied by Russia in the 19th century. About a decade later, in violation of the Gulistan treaty, the Russians invaded Iran's <a href="Erivan%20Khanate">Erivan Khanate</a>. This sparked the final bout of hostilities between the two, the <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281826-1828%29">Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828</a>. The resulting <a href="Treaty%20of%20Turkmenchay">Treaty of Turkmenchay</a>, forced <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Qajar Iran</a> to cede sovereignty over the Erivan Khanate, the <a href="Nakhchivan%20Khanate">Nakhchivan Khanate</a> and the remainder of the <a href="Lankaran%20Khanate">Lankaran Khanate</a>, comprising the last parts of the soil of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic that were still in Iranian hands. After incorporation of all Caucasian territories from Iran into Russia, the new border between the two was set at the <a href="Aras%20River">Aras River</a>, which, upon the Soviet Union's disintegration, subsequently became part of the border between Iran and the Azerbaijan Republic.

Qajar Iran was forced to cede its Caucasian territories to Russia in the 19th century, which thus included the territory of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic, while as a result of that cession, the <a href="Azerbaijanis">Azerbaijani ethnic group</a> is nowadays parted between two nations: Iran and Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, the number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran far outnumber those in neighbouring Azerbaijan.

After the collapse of the Russian Empire during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the short-lived <a href="Transcaucasian%20Democratic%20Federative%20Republic">Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic</a> was declared, constituting what are the present-day republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia.

It was followed by the <a href="March%20Days">March Days</a> massacres that took place between 30 March and 2 April 1918 in the city of <a href="Baku">Baku</a> and adjacent areas of the <a href="Baku%20Governorate">Baku Governorate</a> of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. When the republic dissolved in May 1918, the leading <a href="Musavat">Musavat</a> party declared independence as the <a href="Azerbaijan%20Democratic%20Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a> (ADR), adopting the name of "Azerbaijan" for the new republic; a name that prior to the proclamation of the ADR was solely used to refer to the adjacent <a href="Iranian%20Azerbaijan">northwestern region of contemporary Iran</a>. The ADR was the first modern <a href="parliamentary%20republic">parliamentary republic</a> in the Muslim world. Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of <a href="Baku%20State%20University">Baku State University</a>, which was the first modern-type university founded in the Muslim East.

On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Kars">Treaty of Kars</a>. The previously independent <a href="Republic%20of%20Aras">Republic of Aras</a> would also become the <a href="Nakhichevan%20Autonomous%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic</a> within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of <a href="Syunik%20Province">Zangezur</a> and Turkey agreed to return <a href="Gyumri">Gyumri</a> (then known as Alexandropol).

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the Soviet Union, with 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a> being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20USSR">Supreme Soviet of the USSR</a> in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the <a href="petroleum%20industry">oil industry</a> of Azerbaijan were awarded orders and medals. <a href="Operation%20Edelweiss">Operation Edelweiss</a> carried out by the German <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy (petroleum) dynamo of the USSR. A fifth of all Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945. Approximately 681,000 people with over 100,000 of them women went to the front, while the total population of Azerbaijan was 3.4¬†million at the time. Some 250,000 people from Azerbaijan were killed on the front. More than 130 Azerbaijanis were named <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Heroes of the Soviet Union</a>. Azerbaijani Major-General <a href="Azi%20Aslanov">Azi Aslanov</a> was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union.

Following the politics of "<a href="glasnost">glasnost</a>", initiated by <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20Autonomous%20Oblast">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to Moscow's indifference to already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated in <a href="Black%20January">Black January</a> in Baku. Later in 1990, the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20Azerbaijan%20SSR">Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR</a> dropped the words "Soviet Socialist" from the title, adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic and restored flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as the state flag. As an consequence of the <a href="1991%20Soviet%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt">failed coup that occurred in August in Moscow</a>, on 18 October 1991, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991, when the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December 1991.

The early years of independence were overshadowed by the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20war">Nagorno-Karabakh war</a> with the ethnic Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by Armenia. By the end of hostilities in 1994, Armenians controlled up to 14‚Äì16 percent of Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh itself. During the war many atrocities were committed including the <a href="massacre">massacre</a> at <a href="Malibeyli%20and%20Gushchular%20Massacre">Malibeyli and Gushchular</a>, the <a href="Garadaghly%20massacre">Garadaghly</a>, <a href="Agdaban%20massacre">Agdaban</a> and the <a href="Khojaly%20massacre">Khojaly massacre</a>s. Furthermore, an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and more than a million people had been displaced. Four <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> Resolutions (<a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20822">822</a>, <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20853">853</a>, <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20874">874</a>, and <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20884">884</a>) demand for "the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan." Many Russians and Armenians left Azerbaijan during the 1990s. According to the 1970 census, there were 510,000 ethnic <a href="Russian%20diaspora">Russians</a> and 484,000 Armenians in Azerbaijan.

In 1993, democratically elected president <a href="Abulfaz%20Elchibey">Abulfaz Elchibey</a> was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel <a href="Surat%20Huseynov">Surat Huseynov</a>, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of <a href="Azerbaijan%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Soviet Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="Heydar%20Aliyev">Heydar Aliyev</a>. In 1994, Surat Huseynov, by that time a prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but Huseynov was arrested and charged with treason. A year later, in 1995, another <a href="1995%20Azerbaijani%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt">coup</a> was attempted against Aliyev, this time by the commander of the <a href="OMON">OMON</a> special unit, <a href="Rovshan%20Javadov">Rovshan Javadov</a>. The coup was averted, resulting in the killing of the latter and disbanding of Azerbaijan's OMON units. At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy. In October 1998, Aliyev was reelected for a second term. Despite the much improved economy, particularly with the exploitations of <a href="Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli">Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field</a> and <a href="Shah%20Deniz%20gas%20field">Shah Deniz gas field</a>, Aliyev's presidency was criticized due to suspected vote fraud and corruption.

<a href="Ilham%20Aliyev">Ilham Aliyev</a>, the son of Heydar Aliyev, became chairman of the <a href="New%20Azerbaijan%20Party">New Azerbaijan Party</a> as well as <a href="President">President</a> of Azerbaijan when his father died in 2003. He was <a href="Azerbaijani%20presidential%20election%2C%202013">reelected to a third term</a> as president in October 2013.

Geographically Azerbaijan is located in the <a href="South%20Caucasus">South Caucasus</a> region of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, straddling <a href="Southwest%20Asia">Western Asia</a> and Eastern Europe. It lies between latitudes <a href="38th%20parallel%20north">38¬∞</a> and <a href="42nd%20parallel%20north">42¬∞ N</a>, and longitudes <a href="44th%20meridian%20east">44¬∞</a> and <a href="51st%20meridian%20east">51¬∞ E</a>. The total length of Azerbaijan's <a href="List%20of%20land%20border%20lengths">land borders</a> is , of which 1,007¬†kilometers are with Armenia, 756¬†kilometers with Iran, 480¬†kilometers with Georgia, 390¬†kilometers with Russia and 15¬†kilometers with Turkey. The <a href="coast">coast</a>line stretches for , and the length of the widest area of the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea is . The territory of Azerbaijan extends from north to south, and from west to east.

Three physical features dominate Azerbaijan: the Caspian Sea, whose shoreline forms a natural boundary to the east; the <a href="Greater%20Caucasus">Greater Caucasus</a> mountain range to the north; and the extensive flatlands at the country's center. There are also three mountain ranges, the Greater and <a href="Lesser%20Caucasus">Lesser Caucasus</a>, and the <a href="Talysh%20Mountains">Talysh Mountains</a>, together covering approximately 40% of the country. The highest peak of Azerbaijan is mount <a href="Bazard%C3%BCz%C3%BC">Bazard√ºz√º</a> (4,466¬†m), while the lowest point lies in the Caspian Sea (‚àí28¬†m). Nearly half of all the <a href="mud%20volcano">mud volcano</a>es on Earth are concentrated in Azerbaijan, <a href="mud%20volcanoes%20in%20Azerbaijan">these volcanoes</a> were also among nominees for the <a href="New7Wonders%20of%20Nature">New7Wonders of Nature</a>.

The main water sources are surface waters. However, only 24 of the 8,350 rivers are greater than in length. All the rivers drain into the Caspian Sea in the east of the country. The largest lake is <a href="Lake%20Sarysu">Sarysu</a> (67¬†km¬≤), and the longest river is <a href="Kura%20%28Caspian%20Sea%29">Kur</a> (1,515¬†km), which is <a href="Transboundary%20river">transboundary</a> with <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>. Azerbaijan's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over thirty square kilometers.

Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the <a href="Politics%20of%20Azerbaijan">Azerbaijani government</a> has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan. But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the <a href="Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan%20pipeline">Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline</a>. Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.

Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan's land mass consists of mountain ridges, crests, <a href="yaila">yaila</a>s, and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400‚Äì1000¬†meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100‚Äì120¬†meters, and others from 0‚Äì50¬†meters and up (<a href="Qobustan%2C%20Absheron">Qobustan, Absheron</a>). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consist of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about ‚àí28¬†meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466¬†meters (Bazard√ºz√º peak).

The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold <a href="arctic">arctic</a> <a href="air%20mass">air mass</a>es of Scandinavian <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a>, temperate of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>n anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone. Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country. The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of <a href="Subtropics">subtropical climate</a> on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high <a href="Sunlight">solar radiation</a> rates.

9 out of 11 existing <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">climate zones</a> are present in Azerbaijan. Both the absolute minimum temperature ( ) and the absolute maximum temperature ( ) were observed in <a href="Julfa%20Rayon">Julfa</a> and <a href="Ordubad%20Rayon">Ordubad</a> ‚Äì regions of <a href="Nakhchivan%20Autonomous%20Republic">Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic</a>. The maximum annual <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> falls in <a href="Lankaran">Lankaran</a> () and the minimum in Absheron ().

Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period (what period would that be??). This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately per year of water per square kilometer. All big <a href="Reservoir">water reservoirs</a> are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the <a href="Caspian%20Sea%20basin">Caspian Sea basin</a>.

There are 8,350 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Only 24 rivers are over 100¬†kilometers long. The <a href="Kura%20%28Caspian%20Sea%29">Kura</a> and <a href="Aras%20River">Aras</a> are the major rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the <a href="Kura-Aras%20Lowland">Kura-Aras Lowland</a>. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and <a href="Talysh%20Mountains">Talysh Mountains</a> and run along the Samur‚ÄìDevechi and Lankaran lowlands.

<a href="Yanar%20Dag">Yanar Dag</a>, translated as "burning mountain", is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the <a href="Absheron%20Peninsula">Absheron Peninsula</a> on the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> near <a href="Baku">Baku</a>, which itself is known as the "land of fire." Flames jet out into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer. It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area.

The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the flora and fauna of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century.

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan. The national animal of Azerbaijan is the <a href="Karabakh%20horse">Karabakh horse</a>, a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. However, today the horse is an endangered species.

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of <a href="higher%20plants">higher plants</a>. Due to the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus. About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> can be found in Azerbaijan.

The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new <a href="Constitution%20of%20Azerbaijan">Constitution</a> on 12 November 1995. According to Article 23 of the Constitution, the <a href="National%20symbol">state symbols</a> of the Azerbaijan Republic are the <a href="Flag%20of%20Azerbaijan">flag</a>, the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Azerbaijan">coat of arms</a>, and the <a href="National%20Anthem%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Azerbaijan">national anthem</a>. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.

The government of Azerbaijan is based on the <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a> among the <a href="Legislature">legislative</a>, executive, and <a href="Judiciary">judicial</a> branches. The legislative power is held by the <a href="Unicameralism">unicameral</a> <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Azerbaijan">National Assembly</a> and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The <a href="New%20Azerbaijan%20Party">Yeni Azerbaijan Party</a>, and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the <a href="Azerbaijani%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202010">2010 Parliamentary election</a>, the opposition parties, <a href="Musavat">Musavat</a> and <a href="Azerbaijani%20Popular%20Front%20Party">Azerbaijani Popular Front Party</a>, failed to win a single seat. European observers <a href="Azerbaijani%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202010%23Campaign%20irregularities">found numerous irregularities</a> in the run-up to the election and <a href="Azerbaijani%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202010%23Election">on election day</a>.

The executive power is held by the <a href="President%20of%20Azerbaijan">president</a>, who is elected for a seven-year term by direct elections, and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Azerbaijan">prime minister</a>. The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the president and the National Assembly. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Azerbaijan">Constitutional Court</a>, <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Azerbaijan">Supreme Court</a>, and the <a href="Economic%20Court%20of%20Azerbaijan">Economic Court</a>. The president nominates the judges in these courts. The <a href="European%20Commission%20for%20the%20Efficiency%20of%20Justice">European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice</a> (CEPEJ) report refers to the Azerbaijani justice model on the selection of new judges as best practice that reflects the particular features and the course of development towards ensuring the independence and quality of the judiciary in a new democracy.

The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.

Although Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as "not free" (on border with "partly free") by <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a>. In recent years, large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, and human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities. A resolution adopted by the European Parliament in September 2015 described Azerbaijan as "having suffered the greatest decline in democratic governance in all of Eurasia over the past ten years," noting as well that its dialogue with the country on human rights has "not made any substantial progress." On 17 March 2016, the President of Azerbaijan signed a decree pardoning more than a dozen of the persons regarded as political prisoners by some NGOs. This decree was welcomed as a positive step by the US State Department. On 16 March 2017 another pardon decree was signed, which led to the release of additional persons regarded as political prisoners.

Azerbaijan has been harshly criticized for bribing foreign officials and diplomats in order to promote its causes abroad and legitimize its elections at home, a practice which has been termed as 'caviar diplomacy'. However, on 6 March 2017, ESISC (European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center) published a report called ‚ÄúThe Armenian Connection‚Äù where it attacked human rights NGOs and research organisations criticising human rights violations and corruption in Azerbaijan.
ESISC in that report asserted that "Caviar diplomacy" report elaborated by ESI aimed to create climate of suspicion based on slander to form a network of MPs that would engage in a political war against Azerbaijan, and that the network composed of European PMs, Armenian officials and some NGOs: Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, "Human Rights House Foundation", "Open Dialog, European Stability Initiative, and Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, was financed by the Soros Foundation. According to Robert Coalson (Radio Free Europe), ESISC is a part of Baku's lobbying efforts to extend to the use of front think tanks to shift public opinion. Freedom Files Analytical Centre said that "The report is written in the worst traditions of authoritarian propaganda".

The short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland. The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan's independence from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year. The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain, on 6 November 1996. Full diplomatic relations, including mutual exchanges of missions, were first established with Turkey, Pakistan, the United States, Iran and Israel. Azerbaijan has placed a particular emphasis on its "<a href="Special%20relationship%20%28international%20relations%29">special relationship</a>" with Turkey.

Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries so far and holds membership in 38 international organizations. It holds observer status in the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a> and <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> and is a correspondent at the <a href="International%20Telecommunication%20Union">International Telecommunication Union</a>.

Azerbaijan shows some signs of the so-called "<a href="Dutch%20disease">Dutch disease</a>" because of its fast-growing energy sector, which causes inflation and makes non-energy exports more expensive.

In the early 2000s the chronically high inflation was brought under control. This led to the launch of a new currency, the new Azerbaijani manat, on 1 January 2006, to cement the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.

As Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater <a href="oil%20field">oilfields</a> untouched by the Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important spots in the world for <a href="Hydrocarbon%20exploration">oil exploration</a> and development. Meanwhile, the <a href="State%20Oil%20Fund%20of%20Azerbaijan">State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan</a> was established as an extra-budgetary fund to ensure <a href="macroeconomy">macroeconomic</a> stability, transparency in the management of oil revenue, and safeguarding of resources for future generations.

Azeriqaz, a sub-company of SOCAR, intends to ensure full gasification of the country by 2021.

Tourism is an important part of the <a href="economy%20of%20Azerbaijan">economy of Azerbaijan</a>. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. However, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1990s, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.

It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays. In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also become a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism.

The <a href="government%20of%20Azerbaijan">government of Azerbaijan</a> has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite tourist destination as a top priority. It is a national strategy to make tourism a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy. These activities are regulated by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Culture%20and%20Tourism%20%28Azerbaijan%29">Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan</a>.

The BTC is designed to transport up to 50¬†million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets. The <a href="South%20Caucasus%20Pipeline">South Caucasus Pipeline</a>, also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the <a href="Shah%20Deniz%20gas%20field">Shah Deniz gas field</a>. Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296¬†billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.

In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions. In the same year, the country became a member of the <a href="Vienna%20Convention%20on%20Road%20Traffic">Vienna Convention on Road Traffic</a>. The highest priority being; upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country, as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.

In 2012, the construction of <a href="Kars%E2%80%93Tbilisi%E2%80%93Baku%20railway">Kars‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìBaku railway</a> expected to provide transportation between Asia and Europe through connecting the railways of China and Kazakhstan in the east with Turkey's <a href="Marmaray">Marmaray</a> to the European railway system in the west. <a href="Russian%20gauge">Broad-gauge</a> railways in 2010 stretched for and electrified railways numbered .

The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.

Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector, mostly uninfluenced by the <a href="2007%E2%80%932012%20global%20financial%20crisis">global financial crisis</a>; rapid growth is forecast for at least five more years.

Under article 48 of its <a href="Constitution%20of%20Azerbaijan">Constitution</a>, Azerbaijan is a <a href="secular%20state">secular state</a> and ensures religious freedom. In a 2006‚Äì2008 <a href="Gallup%20%28company%29">Gallup</a> poll, only 21% of respondents from Azerbaijan stated that religion is an important part of their daily lives. This makes Azerbaijan the least religious Muslim-majority country in the world.

Of the nation's religious minorities, Christians who estimated 280,000 (3.1%) are mostly <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian</a> and <a href="Georgian%20Orthodox%20Church">Georgian</a> <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> and <a href="Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church">Armenian Apostolic</a> (almost all Armenians live in the break-away region of Nagorno-Karabakh).

A relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects. In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from <a href="Perso-Arabic%20script">Perso-Arabic script</a> to <a href="Latin%20script">Latin</a> in the 1920s and from Roman to <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> in the 1930s.

According to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Program">United Nations Development Program</a> Report 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan is 99.5 percent.

Since independence, one of the first laws that Azerbaijan's Parliament passed to disassociate itself from the Soviet Union was to adopt a <a href="Azerbaijani%20alphabet">modified-Latin alphabet</a> to replace Cyrillic. Other than that the Azerbaijani system has undergone little structural change. Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content. In addition to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of preschools, general secondary schools, and <a href="vocational%20schools">vocational schools</a>, including specialized secondary schools and technical schools. Education through the eighth grade is compulsory.

The culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences. Today, national traditions are well preserved in the country despite Western influences, including <a href="globalization">globalized</a> consumer culture. Some of the main elements of the Azerbaijani culture are: music, literature, folk dances and art, cuisine, architecture, cinematography and <a href="Novruz%20in%20Azerbaijan">Novruz Bayram</a>. The latter is derived from the traditional celebration of the New Year in the ancient Iranian religion of <a href="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>. Novruz is a family holiday.

The profile of Azerbaijan's population consists, as stated above, of Azerbaijanis, as well as other nationalities or ethnic groups, compactly living in various areas of the country. Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the <a href="Chokha">Chokha</a> and <a href="Papakhi">Papakhi</a>. There are radio broadcasts in Russian, <a href="Georgian%20language">Georgian</a>, <a href="Kurdish%20language">Kurdish</a>, <a href="Lezgian%20language">Lezgian</a> and <a href="Talysh%20language">Talysh</a> languages, which are financed from the state budget. Some local radio stations in <a href="Balak%C9%99n">Balakan</a> and <a href="Khachmaz%20%28city%29">Khachmaz</a> organize broadcasts in <a href="Avar%20language">Avar</a> and <a href="Tat%20language%20%28Caucasus%29">Tat</a>. In Baku several newspapers are published in Russian, Kurdish ("Dengi Kurd"), Lezgian ("Samur") and Talysh languages. Jewish society "Sokhnut" publishes the newspaper "Aziz".

Music of Azerbaijan builds on <a href="Folk%20music">folk traditions</a> that reach back nearly a thousand years. For centuries Azerbaijani music has evolved under the badge of <a href="monody">monody</a>, producing rhythmically diverse melodies. Azerbaijani music has a branchy <a href="Musical%20mode">mode</a> system, where <a href="Chromaticism">chromatization</a> of <a href="major%20and%20minor">major and minor</a> <a href="Musical%20scale">scales</a> is of great importance.

Mugham is usually a suite with poetry and instrumental interludes. When performing mugham, the singers have to transform their emotions into singing and music. In contrast to the mugham traditions of Central Asian countries, Azerbaijani mugham is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to the improvised field of <a href="jazz">jazz</a>. <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> proclaimed the Azerbaijani mugham tradition a <a href="Masterpieces%20of%20the%20Oral%20and%20Intangible%20Heritage%20of%20Humanity">Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity</a> on 7 November 2003.

This tradition has its origin in the <a href="Shamanistic">Shamanistic</a> beliefs of ancient <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic peoples</a>. Ashiqs' songs are semi-improvised around common bases. Azerbaijan's ashiq art was included in the list of <a href="Intangible%20Cultural%20Heritage">Intangible Cultural Heritage</a> by the UNESCO on 30 September 2009.

They are performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear national clothes like the <a href="Chokha">Chokha</a>, which is well-preserved within the national dances. Most dances have a very fast rhythm. The national dance shows the characteristics of the Azerbaijani nation.

Among the medieval authors born within the territorial limits of modern Azerbaijani Republic was Persian poet and philosopher <a href="Nizami%20Ganjavi">Nizami</a>, called Ganjavi after his place of birth, <a href="Ganja%2C%20Azerbaijan">Ganja</a>, who was the author of the <a href="Khamseh">Khamseh</a> ("The Quintuplet"), composed of five romantic poems, including "The Treasure of Mysteries," "Khosrow and Shƒ´rƒ´n," and "Leyli and Mejn≈´n."

The earliest known figure in Azerbaijani literature was <a href="Izzeddin%20Hasanoglu">Izzeddin Hasanoglu</a>, who composed a <a href="Diwan%20%28poetry%29">divan</a> consisting of Persian and Turkic <a href="ghazal">ghazal</a>s. In Persian ghazals he used his pen-name, while his Turkic ghazals were composed under his own name of Hasanoghlu.

Classical literature in Azerbaijani was formed in the 14th century based on the various Early Middle Ages dialects of <a href="Tabriz">Tabriz</a> and <a href="Shirvan">Shirvan</a>. Among the poets of this period were <a href="Kadi%20Burhan%20al-Din">Gazi Burhanaddin</a>, <a href="Jahan%20Shah">Haqiqi</a> (pen-name of <a href="Jahan%20Shah">Jahan-shah Qara Qoyunlu</a>), and <a href="Habibi%20%28poet%29">Habibi</a>. The end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of <a href="Nesimi">Imadaddin Nesimi</a>, one of the greatest <a href="Turkic%20language">Turkic</a> <a href="Hurufi">Hurufi</a> mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early divan masters in Turkic literary history, who also composed poetry in <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> and <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>. The divan and ghazal styles were further developed by poets <a href="Qasim%20al-Anvar">Qasim al-Anvar</a>, <a href="Fuz%C3%BBl%C3%AE">Fuzuli</a> and <a href="Khatai">Khatai</a> (pen-name of <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid</a> <a href="Shah%20Ismail%20I">Shah Ismail I</a>).

The <a href="Book%20of%20Dede%20Korkut">Book of Dede Korkut</a> consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century, was not written earlier than the 15th century. It is a collection of 12 stories reflecting the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads. The 16th-century poet, Muhammed Fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical "Qazals" in Arabic, Persian, and Azerbaijani. Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fizuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include "The Divan of Ghazals" and "The Qasidas". In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of <a href="Ashik">Ashik</a> () poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of KhatƒÅƒ´ ( for "sinner") Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azerbaijani, which were later published as his "Divan". A unique literary style known as "qoshma" ( for "improvization") was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah <a href="Tahmasp%20I">Tahmasp I</a>.

In the span of the 17th and 18th centuries, Fizuli's unique genres as well <a href="Ashik">Ashik</a> poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as <a href="Qovsi%20of%20Tabriz">Qovsi of Tabriz</a>, <a href="Abbas%20II%20of%20Iran">Shah Abbas Sani</a>, <a href="Agha%20Mesih%20Shirvani">Agha Mesih Shirvani</a>, <a href="Nishat%20%28poet%29">Nishat</a>, <a href="Molla%20Vali%20Vidadi">Molla Vali Vidadi</a>, <a href="Molla%20Panah%20Vagif">Molla Panah Vagif</a>, <a href="Amani%20%28poet%29">Amani</a>, <a href="Zafar%20%28poet%29">Zafar</a> and others. Along with <a href="Turkish%20people">Turks</a>, <a href="Turkmens">Turkmens</a> and <a href="Uzbeks">Uzbeks</a>, <a href="Azerbaijanis">Azerbaijanis</a> also celebrate the <a href="Epic%20of%20Koroglu">Epic of Koroglu</a> (from for "blind man's son"), a legendary folk hero. Several documented versions of Koroglu epic remain at the Institute for Manuscripts of the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Azerbaijan">National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan</a>.

Modern literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iran it is based on the Tabrizi one. The first newspaper in Azerbaijani, "<a href="Akinchi">Akinchi</a>" was published in 1875. In the mid-19th century, it was taught in the schools of <a href="Baku">Baku</a>, <a href="Ganja%20%28city%29">Ganja</a>, <a href="Shaki%2C%20Azerbaijan">Shaki</a>, <a href="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a>, and <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a>. Since 1845, it has also been taught in the <a href="University%20of%20Saint%20Petersburg">University of Saint Petersburg</a> in Russia.

Azerbaijanis have a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is <a href="decorative%20art">decorative</a> and <a href="applied%20art">applied art</a>. This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.

The <a href="Azerbaijani%20rug">Azerbaijani carpet</a> is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a <a href="Masterpieces%20of%20the%20Oral%20and%20Intangible%20Heritage%20of%20Humanity">Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage</a> by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>.

Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery, ceramics, and carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological sites in Dashbulaq, Hasansu, Zayamchai, and Tovuzchai uncovered from the BTC pipeline have revealed early Iron Age artifacts.

Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. Scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of <a href="Latif%20Kerimov">Latif Kerimov</a>, a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.

The traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes. Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table. Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens. Saffron-rice <a href="plov">plov</a> is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and <a href="black%20tea">black tea</a> is the national beverage. Azerbaijanis often use traditional <a href="armudu">armudu</a> (pear-shaped) glass as they have very strong <a href="Azerbaijani%20tea%20culture">tea culture</a>. Popular traditional dishes include "bozbash" (lamb soup that exists in several regional varieties with the addition of different vegetables), <a href="qutab">qutab</a> (fried turnover with a filling of greens or minced meat) and <a href="dushbara">dushbara</a> (sort of dumplings of dough filled with ground meat and flavor).

Azerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of <a href="Eastern%20world">East</a> and <a href="Western%20culture">West</a>. Azerbaijiani architecture has heavy influences from Persian architecture. Many ancient architectural treasures such as the <a href="Maiden%20Tower%20%28Baku%29">Maiden Tower</a> and <a href="Palace%20of%20the%20Shirvanshahs">Palace of the Shirvanshahs</a> in the <a href="Baku">Walled City of Baku</a> survive in modern Azerbaijan. Entries submitted on the <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage">UNESCO World Heritage</a> tentative list include the <a href="Ateshgah%20of%20Baku">Ateshgah of Baku</a>, <a href="Momine%20Khatun%20Mausoleum">Momine Khatun Mausoleum</a>, <a href="Hirkan%20National%20Park">Hirkan National Park</a>, <a href="Binegadi%20National%20Park">Binegadi National Park</a>, <a href="L%C3%B6kbatan%20Mud%20Volcano">L√∂kbatan Mud Volcano</a>, <a href="Baku%20Stage%20Mountain">Baku Stage Mountain</a>, <a href="Caspian%20Shore%20Defensive%20Constructions">Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions</a>, <a href="Shusha%20National%20Reserve">Shusha National Reserve</a>, <a href="Ordubad%20National%20Reserve">Ordubad National Reserve</a> and the <a href="Palace%20of%20Shaki%20Khans">Palace of Shaki Khans</a>.

Among other architectural treasures are <a href="Quadrangular%20castle%20%28Mardakan%29">Quadrangular Castle</a> in <a href="Mardakan">Mardakan</a>, <a href="Parigala">Parigala</a> in <a href="Yuxar%C4%B1%20%C3%87ardaqlar">Yukhary Chardaglar</a>, a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the <a href="Baku%20Metro">Baku subways</a> are noted for their lavish decor.

The task for modern Azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. Major projects such as <a href="Heydar%20Aliyev%20Cultural%20Center">Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center</a>, <a href="Flame%20Towers">Flame Towers</a>, <a href="Baku%20Crystal%20Hall">Baku Crystal Hall</a>, <a href="Baku%20White%20City">Baku White City</a> and <a href="SOCAR%20Tower">SOCAR Tower</a> have transformed the country's skyline and promotes its contemporary identity.

Azerbaijani art includes one of the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered as <a href="Gamigaya%20Petroglyphs">Gamigaya Petroglyphs</a> in the territory of <a href="Ordubad%20Rayon">Ordubad Rayon</a> are dated back to the 1st to 4th centuries BC. About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer, goats, bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings and also people, carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks. Norwegian <a href="ethnographer">ethnographer</a> and adventurer <a href="Thor%20Heyerdahl">Thor Heyerdahl</a> was convinced that people from the area went to <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> in about 100 AD and took their boat building skills with them, and transmuted them into the Viking boats in Northern Europe.

Over the centuries, Azerbaijani art has gone through many stylistic changes. Azerbaijani painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light, as exemplified in the works of <a href="Azim%20Azimzade">Azim Azimzade</a> and <a href="Bahruz%20Kangarli">Bahruz Kangarli</a>, and a preoccupation with religious figures and cultural motifs. Azerbaijani painting enjoyed preeminence in Caucasus for hundreds of years, from the <a href="Romanesque%20art">Romanesque</a> and <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> periods, and through the <a href="Socialist%20realism">Soviet</a> and <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> periods, the latter two of which saw fruition in Azerbaijan. Other notable artists who fall within these periods include <a href="Sattar%20Bahlulzade">Sattar Bahlulzade</a>, <a href="Togrul%20Narimanbekov">Togrul Narimanbekov</a>, <a href="Tahir%20Salahov">Tahir Salahov</a>, <a href="Alakbar%20Rezaguliyev">Alakbar Rezaguliyev</a>, <a href="Mirza%20Gadim%20Iravani">Mirza Gadim Iravani</a>, <a href="Mikayil%20Abdullayev">Mikayil Abdullayev</a> and <a href="Boyukagha%20Mirzazade">Boyukagha Mirzazade</a>.

The film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a>. Therefore, it's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in <a href="Baku">Baku</a> ‚Äì at the start of the 20th century, this bay town on the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian</a> was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work. In 1919, during the <a href="Azerbaijan%20Democratic%20Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a>, a documentary "The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence" was filmed on Azerbaijan's independence day, 28 May, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku. After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema. This also influenced the creation of <a href="Azerbaijani%20animation">Azerbaijani animation</a>.

In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming 2 August to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.

There are three state-owned television channels: <a href="AzTV">AzTV</a>, <a href="Idman%20Azerbaijan%20TV">Idman TV</a> and <a href="Medeniyyet%20TV">Medeniyyet TV</a>. One public channel and 6 private channels: <a href="%C4%B0ctimai%20Television">ƒ∞ctimai Television</a>, <a href="ANS%20TV">ANS TV</a>, <a href="Space%20TV">Space TV</a>, <a href="Lider%20TV">Lider TV</a>, <a href="Azad%20Azerbaijan%20TV">Azad Azerbaijan TV</a>, <a href="Xazar%20TV">Xazar TV</a> and <a href="Region%20TV">Region TV</a>.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Azerbaijan">Constitution of Azerbaijan</a> claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice. After several years of decline in press and media freedom, in 2014 the media environment in Azerbaijan deteriorated fast under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> (May‚ÄìNovember 2014). Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm. All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country.

According to the 2013 <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a> <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20Press%20%28report%29">Freedom of the Press report</a>, Azerbaijan's press freedom status is "not free," and Azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries.

<a href="Radio%20Free%20Europe/Radio%20Liberty">Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</a> and <a href="Voice%20of%20America">Voice of America</a> are banned in Azerbaijan.

During the last few years, three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international human rights organizations. Azerbaijan has the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in Europe and Central Asia in 2015, according to the <a href="Committee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>, and is the 5th most censored country in the world, ahead of Iran and China.

A report by an <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> researcher in October 2015 points to '...the severe deterioration of human rights in Azerbaijan over the past few years. Sadly Azerbaijan has been allowed to get away with unprecedented levels of repression and in the process almost wipe out its civil society'. Amnesty's 2015/16 annual report on the country stated ' ... persecution of political dissent continued. Human rights organizations remained unable to resume their work. At least 18 prisoners of conscience remained in detention at the end of the year. Reprisals against independent journalists and activists persisted both in the country and abroad, while their family members also faced harassment and arrests. International human rights monitors were barred and expelled from the country. Reports of torture and other ill-treatment persisted.'

The Guardian reported 9-4-17: "Azerbaijan‚Äôs ruling elite operated a secret $2.9bn (¬£2.2bn) scheme to pay prominent Europeans, buy luxury goods and launder money through a network of opaque British companies, an investigation by the Guardian reveals. Leaked data shows that the Azerbaijani leadership, accused of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014. Some of this money went to politicians and journalists, as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of Azerbaijan‚Äôs president, Ilham Aliyev, and to promote a positive image of his oil-rich country. There is no suggestion that all the recipients were aware of the original source of the money. It arrived via a disguised route."

Freestyle wrestling has been traditionally regarded as Azerbaijan's <a href="national%20sport">national sport</a>, in which Azerbaijan won up to <a href="Azerbaijan%20at%20the%20Olympics">fourteen medals</a>, including four golds since joining the <a href="National%20Olympic%20Committee">National Olympic Committee</a>.

Amateur astronomy

Amateur astronomy is a <a href="hobby">hobby</a> whose participants enjoy observing or imaging celestial objects in the <a href="sky">sky</a> using the <a href="Naked%20eye">unaided eye</a>, <a href="binoculars">binoculars</a>, or <a href="telescope">telescope</a>s. Even though scientific <a href="research">research</a> may not be their primary goal, some amateur astronomers make contributions to the science of astronomy, such as by monitoring <a href="variable%20stars">variable stars</a>, <a href="double%20stars">double stars</a> or <a href="occultation">occultation</a>s of <a href="star">star</a>s by the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> or <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s, or by discovering transient objects, such as <a href="comet">comet</a>s, galactic <a href="nova">nova</a>e or <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e in other <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a>.
Amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of <a href="income">income</a> or support, and usually have no <a href="professional%20degree">professional degree</a> in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject. Most amateurs are beginners or <a href="hobby">hobby</a>ists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers. Many astronomers have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework; however, since the beginning of the twentieth century, professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and associated activities.

Amateur astronomers typically view the <a href="sky">sky</a> at night, when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible, but others observe during the daytime by viewing <a href="sunspot">sunspot</a>s or <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a>s. Some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or <a href="binoculars">binoculars</a>, but more dedicated amateurs often use portable <a href="optical%20telescope">telescopes</a> or telescopes situated in their private or club <a href="observatory">observatories</a>. Amateurs can also join as members of amateur <a href="astronomical%20society">astronomical societies</a>, which can advise, educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects; or even promoting the science of astronomy among the general public.

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and <a href="phenomenon">phenomena</a>. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, <a href="planet">planet</a>s, <a href="star">star</a>s, <a href="comet">comet</a>s, <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a>s, and a variety of <a href="deep%20sky%20object">deep sky object</a>s such as <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a>s, <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a>, and <a href="nebula">nebula</a>e. Many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur <a href="astrophotography">astrophotography</a>, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including, digital cameras, DSLR cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality <a href="CCD%20camera">CCD camera</a>s.

Most amateur astronomers work at <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible wavelengths</a>, but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. An early pioneer of <a href="radio%20astronomy">radio astronomy</a> was <a href="Grote%20Reber">Grote Reber</a>, an amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built <a href="radio%20telescope">radio telescope</a> in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of <a href="radio%20frequency">radio wavelength</a> emissions from space by <a href="Karl%20Guthe%20Jansky">Karl Jansky</a>. Non-visual amateur astronomy includes the use of <a href="infrared%20filter">infrared filter</a>s on conventional telescopes, and also the use of <a href="radio%20telescope">radio telescope</a>s. Some amateur astronomers use home-made radio telescopes, while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomical research but have since been made available for use by amateurs. The <a href="One-Mile%20Telescope">One-Mile Telescope</a> is one such example.

Amateur astronomers use a range of instruments to study the <a href="sky">sky</a>, depending on a combination of their interests and resources. Methods include simply looking at the night sky with the <a href="naked%20eye">naked eye</a>, using <a href="binoculars">binoculars</a>, and using a variety of <a href="optical%20telescope">optical telescope</a>s of varying power and quality, as well as additional sophisticated equipment, such as <a href="camera">camera</a>s, to study light from the sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the <a href="spectrum">spectrum</a>. Commercial telescopes are available, new and used, but it is also common for amateur astronomers to build (or commission the building of) their own custom telescopes. Some people even focus on <a href="amateur%20telescope%20making">amateur telescope making</a> as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy.

Although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time, relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks. Binoculars, for instance, although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes, also tend to provide a wider <a href="field%20of%20view">field of view</a>, which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky.

Amateur astronomers also use <a href="star%20chart">star chart</a>s that, depending on experience and intentions, may range from simple <a href="planisphere">planisphere</a>s through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky. A range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers, including software that generates maps of the sky, software to assist with astrophotography, observation scheduling software, and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena.

Amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations, which usually takes the form of an observing log. Observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when, as well as describing the details that were seen. Sketching is sometimes used within logs, and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times. The information gathered is used to help studies and interactions between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings. Although not professional information or credible, it is a way for the hobby lovers to share their new sightings and experiences.

The Internet is an essential tool of amateur astronomers.

Aikido

Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury.

Aikido's techniques include: <a href="irimi">irimi</a> (entering), turning movements (that redirect the opponent's attack <a href="momentum">momentum</a>), various types of <a href="Throw%20%28grappling%29">throw</a>s and <a href="joint%20lock">joint lock</a>s).

Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of <a href="Dait%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB%20Aiki-j%C5%ABjutsu">Dait≈ç-ry≈´ Aiki-j≈´jutsu</a>, but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the <a href="Oomoto">≈åmoto-ky≈ç</a> religion. Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term "aiki-j≈´jutsu".

Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him. Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.

The word "aikido" is formed of three <a href="kanji">kanji</a>:

The term "<a href="Aiki%20%28martial%20arts%20principle%29">aiki</a>" does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of <a href="bud%C5%8D">bud≈ç</a>. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.

The term is also found in martial arts such as <a href="judo">judo</a> and <a href="kendo">kendo</a>, and in various non-martial arts, such as <a href="Japanese%20calligraphy">Japanese calligraphy</a> (), <a href="ikebana">flower arranging</a> () and <a href="Japanese%20tea%20ceremony">tea ceremony</a> ().

Therefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the "Way of combining forces", in that the term "aiki" refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort. One applies by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.

Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ( , 14 December 1883¬†‚Äì 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as ("Great Teacher"). The term "aikido" was coined in the twentieth century. Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation. During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing today, aikido has evolved from the "aiki" that Ueshiba studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.

Ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied. The core martial art from which aikido derives is <a href="Daito-ryu%20aiki-jujutsu">Dait≈ç-ry≈´ aiki-j≈´jutsu</a>, which Ueshiba studied directly with <a href="Takeda%20S%C5%8Dkaku">Takeda S≈çkaku</a>, the reviver of that art. Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied <a href="Tenjin%20Shinyo%20Ryu">Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´</a> with Tozawa Tokusabur≈ç in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in 1901, <a href="Yagy%C5%AB%20Shingan-ry%C5%AB">Got≈çha Yagy≈´ Shingan-ry≈´</a> under Nakai Masakatsu in <a href="Sakai%2C%20Osaka">Sakai</a> from 1903 to 1908, and <a href="judo">judo</a> with Kiyoichi Takagi ( , 1894‚Äì1972) in <a href="Tanabe">Tanabe</a> in 1911.

The art of Dait≈ç-ry≈´ is the primary technical influence on aikido. Along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons, such as those for the <a href="spear">spear</a> (), short <a href="Stick%20fighting">staff</a> (), and perhaps the . However, aikido derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ().

Ueshiba moved to <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaid≈ç</a> in 1912, and began studying under Takeda Sokaku in 1915. His official association with Dait≈ç-ry≈´ continued until 1937. However, during the latter part of that period, Ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from Takeda and the Dait≈ç-ry≈´. At that time Ueshiba was referring to his martial art as "Aiki Bud≈ç". It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name "aikido", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society () was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.

After Ueshiba left Hokkaid≈ç in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by <a href="Onisaburo%20Deguchi">Onisaburo Deguchi</a>, the spiritual leader of the <a href="Oomoto">≈åmoto-ky≈ç</a> religion (a neo-<a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> movement) in <a href="Ayabe">Ayabe</a>. One of the primary features of ≈åmoto-ky≈ç is its emphasis on the attainment of <a href="utopia">utopia</a> during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.

In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist. As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students. Several of these students would found their own styles of aikido.

Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by <a href="Minoru%20Mochizuki">Minoru Mochizuki</a> with a visit to <a href="France">France</a> where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students. He was followed by <a href="Tadashi%20Abe">Tadashi Abe</a> in 1952, who came as the official <a href="Aikikai%20Hombu">Aikikai Hombu</a> representative, remaining in France for seven years. <a href="Kenji%20Tomiki">Kenji Tomiki</a> toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of the United States in 1953. Later that year, <a href="Koichi%20Tohei">Koichi Tohei</a> was sent by Aikikai Hombu to <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> for a full year, where he set up several <a href="dojo">dojo</a>. This trip was followed by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in 1955; Italy in 1964 by <a href="Hiroshi%20Tada">Hiroshi Tada</a>; and Germany in 1965 by <a href="Katsuaki%20Asai">Katsuaki Asai</a>. Designated "Official Delegate for Europe and Africa" by Morihei Ueshiba, <a href="Masamichi%20Noro">Masamichi Noro</a> arrived in France in September 1961. <a href="Seiichi%20Sugano">Seiichi Sugano</a> was appointed to introduce aikido to Australia in 1965. Today there are aikido dojo throughout the world.

The largest aikido organization is the <a href="Aikikai%20Foundation">Aikikai Foundation</a>, which remains under the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.

The earliest independent styles to emerge were <a href="Yoseikan%20Aikido">Yoseikan Aikido</a>, begun by <a href="Minoru%20Mochizuki">Minoru Mochizuki</a> in 1931, <a href="Yoshinkan">Yoshinkan</a> Aikido, founded by <a href="Gozo%20Shioda">Gozo Shioda</a> in 1955, and <a href="Shodokan%20Aikido">Shodokan Aikido</a>, founded by <a href="Kenji%20Tomiki">Kenji Tomiki</a> in 1967. The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.

After Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the <a href="Aikikai%20Hombu%20Dojo">Aikikai Hombu Dojo</a>'s chief instructor <a href="Koichi%20Tohei">Koichi Tohei</a>, in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, <a href="Kisshomaru%20Ueshiba">Kisshomaru Ueshiba</a>, who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of "ki" development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called <a href="Shin%20Shin%20Toitsu%20Aikido">Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido</a>, and the organization that governs it, the <a href="Ki%20Society">Ki Society</a> ("Ki no Kenky≈´kai").

A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in <a href="Iwama%2C%20Ibaraki">Iwama, Ibaraki</a> and the teaching methodology of long term student <a href="Morihiro%20Saito">Morihiro Saito</a>. It is unofficially referred to as the "<a href="Iwama%20style">Iwama style</a>", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called <a href="Iwama%20Ryu">Iwama Ryu</a>. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups. One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent <a href="Shinshin%20Aikishuren%20Kai">Shinshin Aikishuren Kai</a> in 2004 around Saito's son <a href="Hitohiro%20Saito">Hitohiro Saito</a>.

Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own in Japan, and have an international breadth.

The study of "<a href="Qi">ki</a>" is an important component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses both. The "<a href="kanji">kanji</a>" for "ki" normally is written as . It was written as until the <a href="T%C5%8Dy%C5%8D%20kanji">writing reforms after World War II</a>, and this older form still is seen on occasion.

The character for "ki" is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as , or . "Ki" has many meanings, including "ambience", "mind", "mood", and "intention", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to "life energy". <a href="G%C5%8Dz%C5%8D%20Shioda">G≈çz≈ç Shioda</a>'s <a href="Yoshinkan">Yoshinkan Aikido</a>, considered one of the "hard styles", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to "ki" lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point. In later years, Ueshiba's application of "ki" in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This was his <a href="Takemusu">Takemusu</a> Aiki and many of his later students teach about "ki" from this perspective. <a href="Koichi%20Tohei">Koichi Tohei</a>'s <a href="Ki%20Society">Ki Society</a> centers almost exclusively around the study of the <a href="empirical">empirical</a> (albeit subjective) experience of "ki" with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and "ki" development.

In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a>, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and <a href="Physical%20exercise">conditioning</a>, as well as specific techniques. Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of <a href="throw%20%28grappling%29">throws</a>, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and <a href="Pinning%20hold">pins</a>. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.

Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled <a href="relaxation%20technique">relaxation</a>, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, <a href="flexibility%20%28anatomy%29">flexibility</a>, and <a href="endurance">endurance</a>, with less emphasis on <a href="strength%20training">strength training</a>. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.

In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to <a href="yoga">yoga</a> or <a href="pilates">pilates</a>. For example, many dojos begin each class with , which may include <a href="stretching">stretching</a> and <a href="Uke%20%28martial%20arts%29">ukemi</a> (break falls).

Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms ("<a href="kata">kata</a>") rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique ("<a href="uke%20%28martial%20arts%29">uke</a>") to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique‚Äîthe "<a href="Tori%20%28martial%20arts%29">tori</a>", or "shite" (depending on aikido style), also referred to as "nage" (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.

Both halves of the technique, that of "uke" and that of "tori", are considered essential to aikido training. Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. "Tori" learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while "uke" learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which "tori" places them. This "receiving" of the technique is called "ukemi". "Uke" continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while "tori" uses position and timing to keep "uke" off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, "uke" will sometimes apply to regain balance and pin or throw "tori".

Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.

Many of the of aikido resemble cuts from a <a href="sword">sword</a> or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for <a href="weapon">armed</a> combat. Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches ("<a href="tsuki">tsuki</a>"), are practiced as thrusts with a <a href="knife">knife</a> or sword. <a href="Kick">Kick</a>s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic strikes include:

Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a <a href="Katana">weapon</a>; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender. The following are examples of some basic grabs:

The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Dait≈ç-ry≈´ Aiki-j≈´jutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.

Aikido is more of a defensive martial art. It makes use of body movement ("<a href="tai%20sabaki">tai sabaki</a>") to blend with "uke". For example, an "entering" ("<a href="irimi">irimi</a>") technique consists of movements inward towards "uke", while a technique uses a pivoting motion.
Additionally, an technique takes place in front of "uke", whereas an technique takes place to their side; a technique is applied with motion to the front of "uke", and a version is applied with motion towards the rear of "uke", usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture ("<a href="seiza">seiza</a>"). Techniques where both "uke" and "tori" are standing are called "tachi-waza", techniques where both start off in "seiza" are called "suwari-waza", and techniques performed with "uke" standing and "tori" sitting are called "hanmi handachi" ().

Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations. For instance, "ikky≈ç" can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an "ura" type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an "omote-waza" version). Specific aikido "kata" are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)". For instance, "katate-dori ikky≈ç" refers to any "ikky≈ç" technique executed when "uke" is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as "katate-dori ikky≈ç omote", referring to any forward-moving "ikky≈ç" technique from that grab.

"<a href="Atemi">Atemi</a>" () are strikes (or <a href="feint">feint</a>s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view "atemi" as attacks against "<a href="pressure%20point">vital points</a>" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, <a href="Gozo%20Shioda">G≈çz≈ç Shioda</a> described using "atemi" in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader. Others consider "atemi", especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques. A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break their concentration. The target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.
Many sayings about "atemi" are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique.

Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff ("<a href="j%C5%8D">j≈ç</a>"), wooden sword ("<a href="bokken">bokken</a>"), and knife ("<a href="tant%C5%8D">tant≈ç</a>"). Some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques. Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught. Some schools, such as the <a href="Iwama%20style">Iwama style</a> of <a href="Morihiro%20Saito">Morihiro Saito</a>, usually spend substantial time with "bokken" and "j≈ç", practised under the names "<a href="aiki-ken">aiki-ken</a>", and "<a href="aiki-j%C5%8D">aiki-j≈ç</a>", respectively.

The founder developed many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional sword and spear movements. Consequently, the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).

One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called "taninzudori", or "taninzugake". Freestyle practice with multiple attackers, called "<a href="randori">randori</a>" () or "jiy≈´waza" (), is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks. "Randori" exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment. Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in "randori" training. For instance, an "ura" technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.

In <a href="Shodokan%20Aikido">Shodokan Aikido</a>, "randori" differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will. In this respect it resembles judo "randori".

In applying a technique during training, it is the responsibility of "tori" to prevent injury to "uke" by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in "ukemi". Injuries (especially those to the joints), when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of "tori" misjudging the ability of "uke" to receive the throw or pin.

A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other.
Soft tissue injuries are one of the most common types of injuries found within aikido, as well as joint strain and stubbed fingers and toes. Several deaths from head-and-neck injuries, caused by aggressive "shih≈çnage" in a <a href="Senpai%20and%20k%C5%8Dhai">senpai/k≈çhai</a> hazing context, have been reported.

Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations. This is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness. Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute techniques without hesitation. As a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.

Aikido practitioners (commonly called "aikid≈çka" outside Japan) generally progress by promotion through a series of "grades" ("<a href="ky%C5%AB">ky≈´</a>"), followed by a series of "degrees" ("<a href="dan%20%28rank%29">dan</a>"), pursuant to formal testing procedures. Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and <a href="Black%20belt%20%28martial%20arts%29">black belts</a> to distinguish "kyu" and "dan" grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another. Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a "dan" rank unless they are 16 or older.
The uniform worn for practicing aikido ("<a href="aikidogi">aikid≈çgi</a>") is similar to the training uniform ("<a href="keikogi">keikogi</a>") used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick ("<a href="judo">judo</a>-style"), and thin ("<a href="karate">karate</a>-style") cotton tops are used. Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.

Most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or <a href="indigo">indigo</a> trousers called a "<a href="hakama">hakama</a>" (used also in <a href="kendo">kendo</a> and <a href="iaido">iaido</a>). In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with ("dan") ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a "hakama" regardless of rank.

The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training. The attacks initiated by "uke" (and which "tori" must defend against) have been criticized as being "weak", "sloppy", and "little more than caricatures of an attack".
Weak attacks from "uke" allow for a conditioned response from "tori", and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. <a href="Shodokan%20Aikido">Shodokan Aikido</a> addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.

Another criticism pertains to the shift in training focus after the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by "tori", entering ("irimi") and initiation of techniques by "tori", the distinction between "omote" (front side) and "ura" (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.

Conversely, some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba. According to Minoru Shibata of Aikido Journal, "O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts." That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional "<a href="jujutsu">jujutsu</a>" or "<a href="kenjutsu">kenjutsu</a>" are diverging from what Ueshiba taught. Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that "[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals of the paradigm that he demonstrated."

Art

Art is a diverse range of <a href="human%20behavior">human activities</a> in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (<a href="artworks">artworks</a>), expressing the author's <a href="imagination">imaginative</a> or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.

The oldest documented forms of art are <a href="visual%20arts">visual arts</a>, which include creation of images or objects in fields including today painting, sculpture, <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a>, photography, and other visual media. 

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the <a href="decorative%20arts">decorative arts</a>, or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential‚Äîin a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example. 

Music, theatre, film, dance, and other <a href="performing%20arts">performing arts</a>, as well as literature and other media such as <a href="interactive%20media">interactive media</a>, are included in a broader definition of art or <a href="the%20arts">the arts</a>. Until the 17th century, "art" referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from <a href="craft">craft</a>s or <a href="sciences">sciences</a>. 

In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or <a href="applied%20arts">applied arts</a>.

Art may be characterized in terms of <a href="mimesis">mimesis</a> (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic period</a>, art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science". 

Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from <a href="Agency%20%28philosophy%29">human agency</a> and creation.

The nature of art and related concepts, such as <a href="creativity">creativity</a> and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>.

In the perspective of the history of art, artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early <a href="pre-historic%20art">pre-historic art</a> to <a href="contemporary%20art">contemporary art</a>; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies. One early sense of the definition of "art" is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include "artifact", "artificial", "artifice", "medical arts", and "military arts". However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its <a href="etymology">etymology</a>.
Few modern scholars have been more divided than Plato and Aristotle on the question concerning the importance of art, with Aristotle strongly supporting art in general and Plato generally being opposed to its relative importance. 

Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the <a href="muses">muses</a>, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the "<a href="Phaedrus%20%28Plato%29">Phaedrus</a> "(265a‚Äìc), and yet in the "<a href="Republic%20%28Plato%29">"Republic"</a>" wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In "<a href="Ion%20%28dialogue%29">Ion</a>", Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the "Republic". The dialogue "Ion" suggests that <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted. 

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poetry</a>, tragedy, comedy, <a href="Dithyramb">dithyrambic poetry</a> and music to be <a href="Mimesis">mimetic</a> or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation‚Äîthrough narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.

The second, and more recent, sense of the word "art" as an abbreviation for "creative art" or "fine art" emerged in the early 17th century. Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or "finer" work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word "art" may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts ("art" as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce "artworks" ("art" as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as <a href="Kant">Kant</a>, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered <a href="commercial%20art">commercial art</a> instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered <a href="applied%20art">applied art</a>. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong <a href="emotion">emotion</a>s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher <a href="Richard%20Wollheim">Richard Wollheim</a> as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture". Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating <a href="Formalism%20%28art%29">formal elements</a> for their own sake, and as "<a href="mimesis">mimesis</a>" or <a href="Representation%20%28arts%29">representation</a>. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another. <a href="Benedetto%20Croce">Benedetto Croce</a> and <a href="R.G.%20Collingwood">R.G. Collingwood</a> advanced the <a href="Idealism">idealist</a> view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator. The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, and was developed in the early twentieth century by <a href="Roger%20Fry">Roger Fry</a> and <a href="Clive%20Bell">Clive Bell</a>. More recently, thinkers influenced by <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a> have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation. <a href="George%20Dickie%20%28philosopher%29">George Dickie</a> has offered an <a href="institutional%20theory%20of%20art">institutional theory of art</a> that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the <a href="art%20world">art world</a>" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation". Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."

Sculptures, <a href="cave%20paintings">cave paintings</a>, rock paintings and <a href="petroglyphs">petroglyphs</a> from the <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a> dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The oldest art objects in the world‚Äîa series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old‚Äîwere discovered in a South African cave. Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years. Etched shells by "<a href="Homo%20erectus">Homo erectus</a>" from 430,000 and 540,000 years ago were discovered in 2014.

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Iran">Persia</a>, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as <a href="Inca">Inca</a>, <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya</a>, and <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a>. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.

In <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> and <a href="Medieval%20art">Medieval art</a> of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.

<a href="Renaissance%20art">Renaissance art</a> had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of <a href="graphical%20perspective">graphical perspective</a> to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.

In the east, <a href="Islamic%20art">Islamic art</a>'s rejection of <a href="iconography">iconography</a> led to emphasis on geometric patterns, <a href="Islamic%20calligraphy">calligraphy</a>, and <a href="Islamic%20architecture">architecture</a>. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning <a href="terracotta%20army">terracotta army</a> of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. <a href="Woodblock%20printing">Woodblock printing</a> became important in Japan after the 17th century.

The western <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as <a href="William%20Blake">Blake</a>'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or <a href="Jacques-Louis%20David">David</a>'s propagandistic paintings. This led to <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of <a href="Goethe">Goethe</a>. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as <a href="academic%20art">academic art</a>, <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolism</a>, <a href="impressionism">impressionism</a> and <a href="fauvism">fauvism</a> among others.

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of <a href="impressionism">impressionism</a>, <a href="Expressionism">Expressionism</a>, <a href="Fauvism">Fauvism</a>, <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a>, <a href="Dadaism">Dadaism</a>, <a href="Surrealism">Surrealism</a>, etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing <a href="globalization">global</a> interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, <a href="African%20art">African sculptures</a> were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by <a href="Matisse">Matisse</a>. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like <a href="Communism">Communism</a> and <a href="Post-Modernism">Post-Modernism</a> exerting a powerful influence.

<a href="Modernism">Modernism</a>, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. <a href="Theodor%20W.%20Adorno">Theodor W. Adorno</a> said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist." <a href="Relativism">Relativism</a> was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of <a href="contemporary%20art">contemporary art</a> and <a href="List%20of%20postmodern%20critics">postmodern criticism</a>, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with <a href="skepticism">skepticism</a> and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.

The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as <a href="List%20of%20art%20mediums">media</a>, <a href="genre">genre</a>, <a href="Art%20movement">styles</a>, and form. Art form refers to the <a href="elements%20of%20art">elements of art</a> that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical <a href="Composition%20%28visual%20arts%29">composition</a> of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., <a href="figurae">figurae</a>), such as <a href="Color%20theory">color</a>, <a href="Contour%20drawing">contour</a>, <a href="Fourth%20dimension%20in%20art">dimension</a>, <a href="List%20of%20art%20mediums">medium</a>, <a href="melody">melody</a>, <a href="Negative%20space">space</a>, <a href="Texture%20%28painting%29">texture</a>, and <a href="Lightness">value</a>. Form may also include <a href="Visual%20design%20elements%20and%20principles%23Principles%20of%20design">visual design principles</a>, such as <a href="arrangement">arrangement</a>, <a href="Formal%20balance">balance</a>, <a href="Contrast%20%28vision%29">contrast</a>, <a href="Emphasis%20%28typography%29">emphasis</a>, <a href="harmony">harmony</a>, <a href="Hierarchical%20proportion">proportion</a>, <a href="Principles%20of%20grouping">proximity</a>, and <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a>.

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context. Extreme <a href="Formalism%20%28art%29">Formalism</a> is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content ‚Äì i.e., <a href="denotation">denotation</a>s and <a href="connotation">connotation</a>s ‚Äì while others prefer terms like <a href="Meaning%20%28semiotics%29">meaning</a> and <a href="Importance">significance</a>.

Extreme Intentionalism holds that <a href="authorial%20intent">authorial intent</a> plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded. It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented, and the content as the artist's experience of that subject. For example, the composition of <a href="Napoleon%20I%20on%20his%20Imperial%20Throne">Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne</a> is partly borrowed from the <a href="Statue%20of%20Zeus%20at%20Olympia">Statue of Zeus at Olympia</a>. As evidenced by the title, the subject is <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, and the content is <a href="Jean-Auguste-Dominique%20Ingres">Ingres</a>'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space". Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".

Finally, the developing theory of <a href="post-structuralism">post-structuralism</a> studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. <a href="Art%20criticism">Art criticism</a> continues to grow and develop alongside art.

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a <a href="Media%20%28arts%29">medium</a>. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a <a href="language">language</a> to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of <a href="John%20Singer%20Sargent">John Singer Sargent</a> were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.

A common contemporary criticism of some <a href="modern%20art">modern art</a> occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, <a href="Marcel%20Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>'s "<a href="Fountain%20%28Duchamp%29">Fountain</a>" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. <a href="Tracey%20Emin">Tracey Emin</a>'s "My Bed", or <a href="Damien%20Hirst">Damien Hirst</a>'s "The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living" follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating "hands-on" works of art.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (L√©vi-Strauss).

The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,¬†no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society. 

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the <a href="ceramics%20of%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas</a> are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a <a href="social%20elite">social elite</a>, though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as <a href="Molding%20%28process%29">moulds</a> made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality <a href="Ancient%20Roman%20pottery">Ancient Roman pottery</a> and Greek <a href="Tanagra%20figurine">Tanagra figurine</a>s to a very wide market. <a href="Cylinder%20seal">Cylinder seal</a>s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the <a href="Ancient%20Near%20East">Ancient Near East</a>. Once <a href="coin">coin</a>s were widely used these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society. 

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a> began with small <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by <a href="peasant">peasant</a>s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations. <a href="Popular%20prints">Popular prints</a> of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.

<a href="Public%20art">Public buildings and monuments</a>, secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. <a href="Egyptian%20temple">Egyptian temple</a>s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a>, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the <a href="Orleans%20Collection%23Collection%20in%20Paris">Orleans Collection</a> mostly housed in a wing of the <a href="Palais%20Royal">Palais Royal</a> in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British <a href="Royal%20Collection">Royal Collection</a> remains distinct, but large donations such as the <a href="Old%20Royal%20Library">Old Royal Library</a> were made from it to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, established in 1753. The <a href="Uffizi">Uffizi</a> in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before. The building now occupied by the <a href="Prado">Prado</a> in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Munich and other capitals. The opening of the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Mus√©e du Louvre</a> during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. (<a href="The%20Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York City, for example, was created by <a href="John%20Taylor%20Johnston">John Taylor Johnston</a>, a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects" said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as <a href="performance%20art">performance art</a>, <a href="video%20art">video art</a>, and <a href="conceptual%20art">conceptual art</a>. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works, invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. <a href="Iconoclasm">Iconoclasm</a> is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. <a href="Aniconism">Aniconism</a> is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of <a href="Islamic%20art">Islamic art</a>, where <a href="depictions%20of%20Muhammad">depictions of Muhammad</a> remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by <a href="art%20critic">art critic</a>s, though often much less so by a wider public. The <a href="iconography">iconographic</a> content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the <a href="Swoon%20of%20the%20Virgin">Swoon of the Virgin</a> in scenes of the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion of Jesus</a>. <a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Michelangelo%29">The "Last Judgment"</a> by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of <a href="decorum">decorum</a> through nudity and the <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>-like pose of Christ.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>, and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20G%C3%A9ricault">Th√©odore G√©ricault</a>'s "<a href="The%20Raft%20of%20the%20Medusa">Raft of the Medusa</a>" (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">√âdouard Manet</a>'s "<a href="The%20Luncheon%20on%20the%20Grass">Le D√©jeuner sur l'Herbe</a>" (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the <a href="nude">nude</a> woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world. <a href="John%20Singer%20Sargent">John Singer Sargent</a>'s "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Madame%20X">Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam¬†X)</a>" (1884), caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>'s "<a href="Guernica%20%28painting%29">Guernica</a>" (1937) used arresting <a href="cubism">cubist</a> techniques and stark <a href="Monochrome%20painting">monochromatic oils</a>, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. <a href="Leon%20Golub">Leon Golub</a>'s "Interrogation III" (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. <a href="Andres%20Serrano">Andres Serrano</a>'s "<a href="Piss%20Christ">Piss Christ</a>" (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Christ</a>'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.

Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realism or truth to nature</a> and the <a href="Idealism">ideal</a>; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries. This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art. The aesthetic theorist <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>, who championed what he saw as the naturalism of <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J.¬†M.¬†W. Turner</a>, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. <a href="Richard%20Wollheim">Richard Wollheim</a> distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the <a href="Aesthetic%20realism">Realist</a>, whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the <a href="Objectivity%20%28philosophy%29">Objectivist</a>, whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the <a href="Relativist">Relativist</a> <a href="Aesthetic%20relativism">position</a>, whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.

The arrival of <a href="Modernism">Modernism</a> in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art, and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of <a href="Postmodern%20art">postmodernism</a>. <a href="Clement%20Greenberg">Clement Greenberg</a>'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself". Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:

<a href="Pop%20art">Pop art</a>ists like <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the <a href="art%20world">art world</a>. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond "high art" to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction. There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. "" is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. <a href="Fine%20Art">Fine Art</a>. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but <a href="techne">techne</a>. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and <a href="craft">craft</a> are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, <a href="horsemanship">horsemanship</a>, <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, <a href="carpentry">carpentry</a>, <a href="prophecy">prophecy</a>, and farming etc.

Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the <a href="New%20Criticism">New Criticism</a> school and debate concerning "the intentional fallacy". At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, <a href="W.%20K.%20Wimsatt">William K. Wimsatt</a> and <a href="Monroe%20Beardsley">Monroe Beardsley</a> published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "<a href="Intentional%20Fallacy">The Intentional Fallacy</a>", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an <a href="Authorial%20intentionality">author's intention</a>, or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "<a href="Affective%20fallacy">The Affective Fallacy</a>," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the <a href="reader-response">reader-response</a> school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, <a href="Stanley%20Fish">Stanley Fish</a>, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic." These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote <a href="Richard%20Wollheim">Richard Wollheim</a> as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."

The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-<a href="poststructuralism">poststructuralism</a> debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art. 

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the <a href="structuralism">structuralism</a> of <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Saussure">Ferdinand de Saussure</a> and the ensuing movement of <a href="poststructuralism">poststructuralism</a>. In 1981, the artist <a href="Mark%20Tansey">Mark Tansey</a> created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include <a href="Judith%20Butler">Judith Butler</a>, <a href="Luce%20Irigaray">Luce Irigaray</a>, <a href="Julia%20Kristeva">Julia Kristeva</a>, <a href="Michel%20Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a>. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by <a href="Hayden%20White">Hayden White</a>. The fact that language is "not" a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of <a href="philosophy%20of%20language">philosophy of language</a> which originated in the works of <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Hamann">Johann Georg Hamann</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20von%20Humboldt">Wilhelm von Humboldt</a>. <a href="Ernst%20Gombrich">Ernst Gombrich</a> and <a href="Nelson%20Goodman">Nelson Goodman</a> in his book "<a href="Languages%20of%20Art">Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols</a>" came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s. He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist <a href="Roger%20Sperry">Roger Sperry</a> who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.

 Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included <a href="cubist">cubist</a> and <a href="impressionist">impressionist</a> paintings, <a href="Duchamp">Duchamp</a>'s "<a href="Fountain%20%28Duchamp%29">Fountain</a>", the movies, superlative imitations of <a href="J.%20S.%20G.%20Boggs">banknotes</a>, <a href="conceptual%20art">conceptual art</a>, and <a href="video%20games">video games</a>. Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" criticized <a href="Damien%20Hirst">Hirst</a>'s and <a href="Tracey%20Emin">Emin</a>'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work. In 1998, <a href="Arthur%20Danto">Arthur Danto</a>, suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."

<a href="Anti-art">Anti-art</a> is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art; it is term associated with <a href="Dada">Dada</a>ism and attributed to <a href="Marcel%20Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a> just before World War I, when he was making art from <a href="found%20art">found objects</a>. One of these, "<a href="Fountain%20%28Duchamp%29">Fountain</a>" (1917), an ordinary urinal, has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art. Anti-art is a feature of work by <a href="Situationist%20International">Situationist International</a>, the lo-fi Mail art movement, and the <a href="Young%20British%20Artists">Young British Artists</a>, though it is a form still rejected by the <a href="Stuckism">Stuckists</a>, who describe themselves as <a href="anti-anti-art">anti-anti-art</a>.

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word "art" is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist), or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered "art" is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a>'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd¬†of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the "<a href="zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a>". Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse <a href="aesthetic">aesthetic</a> or <a href="morality">moral</a> feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the <a href="human%20condition">human condition</a>; that is, what it is to be human.

Agnostida

Agnostida is an <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a> which first developed near the end of the <a href="Cambrian">Early Cambrian</a> period and thrived during the Middle Cambrian. They are present in the <a href="Lower%20Cambrian">Lower Cambrian</a> fossil record along with <a href="trilobites">trilobites</a> from the <a href="Redlichiida">Redlichiida</a>, <a href="Corynexochida">Corynexochida</a>, and <a href="Ptychopariida">Ptychopariida</a> orders. The last agnostids went <a href="extinct">extinct</a> in the Late <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a>.

The Agnostida are divided into two suborders¬†‚Äî <a href="Agnostina">Agnostina</a> and <a href="Eodiscina">Eodiscina</a>¬†‚Äî that are then subdivided into a number of <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>. As a group, agnostids are isopygous, meaning that their <a href="pygidium">pygidium</a> is similar in size and shape to their <a href="cephalon%20%28arthropod%20anatomy%29">cephalon</a>. Most agnostid species were eyeless.

The systematic position of the order Agnostida within the class Trilobita remains uncertain, and there has been continuing debate whether they are trilobites or a <a href="stem%20group">stem group</a>. The challenge to the status has focused on the Agnostina partly because <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">juveniles</a> of one genus have been found with legs greatly different from those of adult trilobites, suggesting they are not members of the <a href="lamellipedia">lamellipedia</a>n <a href="clade">clade</a>, of which trilobites are a part. Instead, the limbs of agnostids closely resemble those of stem group crustaceans, although they lack the <a href="proximal%20endite">proximal endite</a>, which defines that group. They are likely the <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> to the crustacean stem lineage, and, as such, part of the clade <a href="Crustaceomorpha">Crustaceomorpha</a>. Other researchers have suggested, based on a <a href="cladistic">cladistic</a> analyses of <a href="dorsum%20%28anatomy%29">dorsal</a> <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeletal</a> features, that Eodiscina and Agnostida are closely united, and that the Eodiscina descended from the trilobite order <a href="Ptychopariida">Ptychopariida</a>.

Scientists have long debated whether the agnostids lived a <a href="pelagic">pelagic</a> or a <a href="benthic">benthic</a> lifestyle. Their lack of eyes, a morphology not well-suited for swimming, and their fossils found in association with other benthic trilobites all suggest a benthic (bottom-dwelling) mode of life. They are likely to have lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on <a href="detritus">detritus</a> that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom. In contrast, their wide geographic dispersion in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> is uncharacteristic of benthic animals, suggesting a pelagic existence. The thoracic segment appears to form a hinge between the head and pygidium allowing for a bivalved <a href="ostracod">ostracod</a>an-type lifestyle. Furthermore, the orientation of the thoracic appendages appears ill-suited for benthic living. However, recent work suggests that some agnostids were benthic predators, engaging in cannibalism and possibly manifesting pack-hunting behavior.

They are sometimes preserved within the voids of other organisms, for instance within empty <a href="hyolith">hyolith</a> conchs, within <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s, <a href="Selkirkia">worm tubes</a> and under the carapaces of <a href="Sidneyia">bivalved arthropods</a>, presumably in order to hide from predators or strong storm currents; or maybe whilst scavenging for food. In the case of the tapering worm tubes "<a href="Selkirkia">Selkirkia</a>", trilobites are always found with their heads directed towards the opening of the tube, suggesting that they reversed in; the absence of any moulted carapaces suggests that moulting was not their primary reason for seeking shelter.
