Bosnia and Herzegovina

Bosnia and Herzegovina ( or ; abbreviated B&H; <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a> and <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a>: "Bosna i Hercegovina (BiH)" / Боснa и Херцеговина (БиХ), <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a>: "Bosna i Hercegovina (BiH)", ), sometimes called Bosnia-Herzegovina, and <a href="Pars%20pro%20toto%23Geography">often known informally as</a> Bosnia, is a country in <a href="Southeastern%20Europe">Southeastern Europe</a> located on the <a href="Balkan%20Peninsula">Balkan Peninsula</a>. <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> is the capital and largest city. Bordered by <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> to the north, and west; <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> to the east; <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> to the southeast; and the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> to the south, with a coastline about long surrounding the town of <a href="Neum">Neum</a>. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland is a geographically larger region and has a moderate <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a>, with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> and plain topography.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a region that traces permanent human settlement back to the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> age, during and after which it was populated by several <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>n and <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic peoples</a> that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the <a href="Banate%20of%20Bosnia">Banate of Bosnia</a> was established, which evolved into the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bosnia">Kingdom of Bosnia</a> in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, under whose rule it would remain from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The <a href="Ottomans">Ottomans</a> brought <a href="Islam%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Islam</a> to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by <a href="History%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20%281878%E2%80%931918%29">annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy</a>, which lasted up until <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> and after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, it was granted full republic status in the newly formed <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic <a href="Breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia%23Independence%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">proclaimed independence</a> in 1992, which was followed by the <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian War</a>, lasting until <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">late 1995</a>.

Today, the country maintains high <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20Human%20Development%20Index">literacy, life expectancy and education</a> levels and is one of the <a href="Tourism%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">most frequently visited countries in the region</a>, projected to have the third highest tourism growth rate in the world between 1995 and 2020. Bosnia and Herzegovina is known for its natural environment and <a href="Culture%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">cultural heritage</a> inherited from six historical civilizations, its <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20cuisine">cuisine</a>, <a href="Tourism%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%23Winter%20sports">winter sports</a>, its eclectic and unique <a href="Music%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">music</a>, <a href="Architecture%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">architecture</a> and its <a href="Sarajevo%23Festivals">festivals</a>, some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe. The country is home to three main ethnic groups or, officially, <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">constituent peoples</a>, as specified in the constitution. <a href="Bosniaks">Bosniaks</a> are the largest group of the three, with <a href="Serbs%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Serbs</a> second and <a href="Croats%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Croats</a> third. A native of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, is identified in English as a <a href="Bosnians">Bosnian</a>. The terms <a href="Herzegovinians">Herzegovinian</a> and Bosnian are maintained as a regional rather than ethnic distinction, and the region of Herzegovina has no precisely defined borders of its own. Moreover, the country was simply called "Bosnia" until the Austro-Hungarian occupation at the end of the 19th century.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has a <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a> legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the <a href="Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and <a href="Republika%20Srpska">Republika Srpska</a>, with a third region, the <a href="Br%C4%8Dko%20District">Brčko District</a>, governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is itself complex and consists of 10 <a href="Cantons%20of%20the%20Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">cantons</a>. The country is a <a href="Accession%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20to%20the%20European%20Union">potential candidate for membership to the European Union</a> and has been a candidate for <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organisation">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</a> membership since April 2010, when it received a <a href="Membership%20Action%20Plan">Membership Action Plan</a> at a summit in <a href="Tallinn">Tallinn</a>. Additionally, the country has been a member of the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> since April 2002 and a founding member of the <a href="Union%20for%20the%20Mediterranean">Mediterranean Union</a> upon its establishment in July 2008.

The first preserved widely acknowledged mention of <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> is in "<a href="De%20Administrando%20Imperio">De Administrando Imperio</a>", a politico-geographical handbook written by the <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20emperors">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Constantine%20VII">Constantine VII</a> in the mid-10th century (between 948 and 952) describing the "small land" (χωρίον in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>) of "Bosona" (Βοσώνα). The name is believed to have been derived from the <a href="hydronym">hydronym</a> of the river <a href="Bosna%20%28river%29">Bosna</a> coursing through the Bosnian heartland. According to philologist Anton Mayer the name "Bosna" could be derived from <a href="Illyrian%20language">Illyrian</a> "Bass-an-as" which would be a diversion of the Proto-Indo-European root "bos" or "bogh", meaning "the running water". According to English medievalist <a href="William%20Miller%20%28historian%29">William Miller</a> the Slavic settlers in Bosnia "adapted the Latin designation [...] Basante, to their own idiom by calling the stream Bosna and themselves "Bosniaks" [...]".

The name "Herzegovina" ("herzog's [land]", from German word for "duke") originates from Bosnian magnate <a href="Stjepan%20Vuk%C4%8Di%C4%87%20Kosa%C4%8Da">Stephen Vukčić Kosača</a>'s title, "Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast" (1448). Hum, formerly <a href="Zahumlje">Zahumlje</a>, was an early medieval principality that was conquered by the Bosnian Banate in the first half of the 14th century. The region was administered by the Ottomans as the <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Herzegovina">Sanjak of Herzegovina</a> ("Hersek") within the <a href="Eyalet%20of%20Bosnia">Eyalet of Bosnia</a> up until the formation of the short-lived <a href="Herzegovina%20Eyalet">Herzegovina Eyalet</a> in the 1830s, which was remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as "Bosnia and Herzegovina".

On initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the "<a href="Republic%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>" but following the 1995 <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Agreement</a> and the new constitution that accompanied it the name was officially changed to "Bosnia and Herzegovina".

Bosnia has been inhabited since at latest the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> age. The earliest Neolithic population became known in the <a href="Classical%20Antiquity">Antiquity</a> as the <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a>. <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> migrations in the 4th century BC were also notable. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different people speaking distinct languages. Conflict between the Illyrians and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> started in 229 BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD 9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a>, as described by the Roman historian <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a>. This was the Roman campaign against <a href="Illyricum%20%28Roman%20province%29">Illyricum</a>, known as "<a href="Bellum%20Batonianum">Bellum Batonianum</a>". The conflict arose after an attempt to recruit Illyrians, and a revolt spanned for four years (6–9 AD), after which they were subdued. In the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from the entire <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> settled among the Illyrians, and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region.
Following the split of the Empire between 337 and 395 AD, Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>. Some claim that the region was conquered by the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a> in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the <a href="Alans">Alans</a> and the <a href="Huns">Huns</a>. By the 6th century, Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian</a> had reconquered the area for the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. Illyrian cultural traits were adopted by the South Slavs, as evidenced in certain customs and traditions, placenames, etc.
Timothy Gregory explains:

The <a href="Early%20Slavs">Early Slavs</a> raided the Western Balkans, including Bosnia, in the 6th and early 7th century (amid the <a href="Migration%20Period">Migration Period</a>), and were composed of small tribal units drawn from a single Slavic confederation known to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a> as the "<a href="Sclaveni">Sclaveni</a>" (whilst the related "<a href="Antes%20people">Antes</a>", roughly speaking, colonized the eastern portions of the Balkans).
Tribes recorded by the ethnonyms of "Serb" and "Croat" are described as a second, latter, migration of different people during the second quarter of the 7th century who do not seem to have been particularly numerous; these early "Serb" and "Croat" tribes, whose exact identity is subject to scholarly debate, came to predominate over the Slavs in the neighbouring regions. The bulk of Bosnia proper, however, appears to have been a territory between Serb and Croat rule and is not enumerated as one of the regions settled by those tribes.

Bosnia is first mentioned "as a land (horion Bosona)" in Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' "<a href="De%20Administrando%20Imperio">De Administrando Imperio</a>" in the mid 10th century, at the end of a chapter (Chap. 32) entitled "Of the Serbs and the country in which they now dwell". This has been scholarly interpreted in several ways and used especially by the Serb national ideologists to prove Bosnia as originally a "Serb" land. Other scholars have asserted the inclusion of Bosnia into Chapter 32 to merely be the result of Serbian Grand Duke <a href="%C4%8Caslav">Časlav</a>'s temporary rule over Bosnia at the time, while also pointing out that Porphyrogenitus does not say anywhere explicitly that Bosnia is a "Serb land". In fact, the very translation of the critical sentence in which the word "Bosona" (Bosnia) appears is subject to varying interpretation.

In time, Bosnia would come to form a unit under its own ruler calling himself Bosnian. Bosnia, along with other territories, became part of <a href="Duklja">Duklja</a> in the 11th century, although it retained its own nobility and institutions.
In the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a> political circumstance led to the area being contested between the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> and the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century, Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as the <a href="Banate%20of%20Bosnia">Banate of Bosnia</a> (under the rule of local "<a href="Ban%20%28title%29">bans</a>"). The first Bosnian ban known by name was <a href="Ban%20Bori%C4%87">Ban Borić</a>. The second was <a href="Ban%20Kulin">Ban Kulin</a> whose rule marked the start of a controversy involving the <a href="Bosnian%20Church">Bosnian Church</a> – considered heretical by the Roman Catholic Church. In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254. During this time the population was called "<a href="Dobri%20Bo%C5%A1njani">Dobri Bošnjani</a>" ("Good Bosnians"). The names Serb and Croat, though occasionally appearing in peripheral areas, were not used in Bosnia proper.

Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the <a href="%C5%A0ubi%C4%87">Šubić</a> and <a href="House%20of%20Kotromani%C4%87">Kotromanić</a> families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when <a href="Stephen%20II%2C%20Ban%20of%20Bosnia">Stephen II Kotromanić</a> became "Ban". By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his ambitious nephew <a href="Tvrtko%20I%20of%20Bosnia">Tvrtko</a> who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. By the year 1377, Bosnia was elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of Tvrtko as the first <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Bosnia">Bosnian King</a> in Mile near <a href="Visoko%20during%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Visoko</a> in the Bosnian heartland.

Following his death in 1391 however, Bosnia fell into a long period of decline. The <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> had already started its <a href="Ottoman%20wars%20in%20Europe">conquest of Europe</a> and posed a major threat to the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463 after its conquest by the Ottoman Empire.

The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and <a href="cultural%20landscape">cultural landscape</a>. The Ottomans allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity — a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans.

Within Bosnia the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.

The four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to lack of strong Christian church organizations and continuous rivalry between the Orthodox and Catholic churches, while the indigenous <a href="Bosnian%20Church">Bosnian Church</a> disappeared altogether (ostensibly by conversion of its members to Islam). The Ottomans referred to them as "kristianlar" while the Orthodox and Catholics were called "gebir" or "kafir", meaning "unbeliever". The Bosnian <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a>s (and the Catholic population as a whole) were protected by official imperial decrees and in accordance and full extent of Ottoman laws, however in effect, these often merely affected arbitrary rule and behavior of powerful local elite.

As the Ottoman Empire continued their rule in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> (<a href="Rumelia">Rumelia</a>), Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province, and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a>, were established and grew into regional centers of trade and <a href="urban%20culture">urban culture</a> and were then visited by <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> traveler <a href="Evliya%20%C3%87elebi">Evliya Çelebi</a> in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of <a href="Architecture%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnian architecture</a> such as the country's first library in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, <a href="madrassa">madrassa</a>s, a school of <a href="Sufi%20philosophy">Sufi philosophy</a>, and a <a href="clock%20tower">clock tower</a> ("Sahat Kula"), bridges such as the <a href="Stari%20Most">Stari Most</a>, the <a href="Tsar%27s%20Mosque">Tsar's Mosque</a> and the <a href="Gazi%20Husrev-beg%27s%20Mosque">Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque</a>.

Furthermore, several Bosnian Muslims played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and <a href="political%20history">political history</a> during this time. Bosnian recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Moh%C3%A1cs">Mohács</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Krbava%20field">Krbava field</a>, while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals such as <a href="Matrak%C3%A7%C4%B1%20Nasuh">Matrakçı Nasuh</a>; generals such as <a href="Isa-Beg%20Isakovi%C4%87">Isa-Beg Isaković</a>, <a href="Gazi%20Husrev-beg">Gazi Husrev-beg</a> and <a href="Hasan%20Predojevi%C4%87">Hasan Predojević</a> and <a href="Sar%C4%B1%20S%C3%BCleyman%20Pa%C5%9Fa">Sarı Süleyman Paşa</a>; administrators such as <a href="Ferhat-pa%C5%A1a%20Sokolovi%C4%87">Ferhat-paša Sokolović</a> and <a href="Osman%20Grada%C5%A1%C4%8Devi%C4%87">Osman Gradaščević</a>; and <a href="Vizier">Grand Viziers</a> such as the influential <a href="Mehmed%20Pa%C5%A1a%20Sokolovi%C4%87">Mehmed Paša Sokolović</a> and <a href="Damad%20Ibrahim%20Pasha">Damad Ibrahim Pasha</a>. Some Bosnians emerged as <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> mystics, scholars such as <a href="Muhamed%20Hevaji%20Uskufi%20Bosnevi">Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi Bosnevi</a>, <a href="Ali%20D%C5%BEabi%C4%8D">Ali Džabič</a>; and poets in the <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>, <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a>, <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, and <a href="Persian%20language">Persian language</a>s.
However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the conclusion of the <a href="Great%20Turkish%20War">Great Turkish War</a> with the <a href="treaty%20of%20Karlowitz">treaty of Karlowitz</a> in 1699 once again made Bosnia the Empire's westernmost province. The following century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague. The Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms.

This, combined with frustrations over territorial, political concessions in the north-east, and the plight of <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> refugees arriving from the <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Smederevo">Sanjak of Smederevo</a> into <a href="Bosnia%20Eyalet">Bosnia Eyalet</a>, culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by <a href="Husein%20Grada%C5%A1%C4%8Devi%C4%87">Husein Gradaščević</a>, who endorsed a multicultural <a href="Bosnia%20Eyalet">Bosnia Eyalet</a> autonomous from the authoritarian rule of the Ottoman Sultan <a href="Mahmud%20II">Mahmud II</a>, who persecuted, executed and abolished the <a href="Janissaries">Janissaries</a> and reduced the role of autonomous <a href="Pasha">Pasha</a>s in <a href="Rumelia">Rumelia</a>. Mahmud II sent his <a href="Grand%20Vizier">Grand Vizier</a> to subdue Bosnia Eyalet and succeeded only with the reluctant assistance of <a href="Ali-pa%C5%A1a%20Rizvanbegovi%C4%87">Ali-paša Rizvanbegović</a>. Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate. Later agrarian unrest eventually sparked the <a href="Herzegovina%20Uprising%20%281875-1878%29">Herzegovinian rebellion</a>, a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation which eventually led to the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%20%281878%29">Treaty of Berlin</a> in 1878.

At the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> in 1878, the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> Foreign Minister <a href="Gyula%20Andr%C3%A1ssy">Gyula Andrássy</a> obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Novi%20Pazar">Sanjak of Novi Pazar</a>, which remained under <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to <a href="Salonika">Salonika</a> that "would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence." "High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired [an...] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective."

On 28 September 1878, the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, backed by the <a href="Archduke%20Albrecht%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Albert</a>, were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution with his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion lost 179 to 95. The gravest accusations were raised by the opposition rank and file against Andrassy.
Although an Austro-Hungarian side quickly came to an agreement with Bosnians, tensions remained in certain parts of the country (particularly the south) and a mass emigration of predominantly Slavic dissidents occurred. However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a "model colony".
With the aim of establishing the province as a stable <a href="political%20spectrum">political model</a> that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism, Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and to provide for modernisation. The Austro-Hungarian Empire built the three Roman Catholic churches in Sarajevo and these three churches are among only 20 Catholic churches in the state of Bosnia.

In 1881, within three years of formal occupation of Bosnia Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary obtained German and the more important Russian approval of the annexation of these provinces at a time that suited Vienna. This mandate was formally ratified by the <a href="League%20of%20the%20Three%20Emperors">Dreikaiserbund (Three Emperor's Treaty)</a> on 18 June of that year. Upon the accession of Czar Nicholas II, however, the Russians reneged on the agreement, asserting in 1897 the need for special scrutiny of the Bosnian Annexation issue at an unspecified future date.

External matters began to affect the Bosnian Protectorate, however, and its relationship with Austria-Hungary. A bloody coup occurred in Serbia, on 10 June 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in Belgrade. Also, the revolt in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1908, raised concerns that the Istanbul government might seek the outright return of Bosnia Herzegovina. These factors caused the Austrian-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question sooner, rather than later.
On 2 July 1908, in response to the pressing of the Austrian-Hungarian claim, the Russian Imperial Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky offered to support the Bosnian annexation in return for Vienna's support for Russia's bid for naval access through the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> Straits into the Mediterranean. With the Russians being, at least, provisionally willing to keep their word over Bosnia Herzegovina for the first time in 11 years, Austria-Hungary waited and then published the annexation proclamation on 6 October 1908. The international furor over the annexation announcement caused Izvolsky to drop the Dardanelles Straits question, altogether, in an effort to obtain a European conference over the Bosnian Annexation. This conference never materialized and without British or French support, the Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909.

Political tensions culminated on 28 June 1914, when a Yugoslav nationalist youth named <a href="Gavrilo%20Princip">Gavrilo Princip</a>, a member of the secret Serbian-supported movement, <a href="Young%20Bosnia">Young Bosnia</a>, <a href="Assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">assassinated</a> the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a>, in Sarajevo—an event that proved to be the spark that set off World War I. At the end of the war, the <a href="Bosniaks">Bosniaks</a> had lost more men per capita than any other ethnic group in the Habsburg Empire whilst serving in the <a href="Bosnian-Herzegovinian%20Infantry">Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry</a> (known as "Bosniaken") of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a>. Nonetheless, Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed.

The Austro-Hungarian authorities established an auxiliary militia known as the <a href="Schutzkorps">Schutzkorps</a> with a moot role in the empire's policy of <a href="anti-Serb">anti-Serb</a> repression. Schutzkorps, predominantly recruited among the Muslim (Bosniak) population, were tasked with hunting down rebel Serbs (the "<a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a>" and "<a href="Komiti">Komiti</a>") and became known for their persecution of <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a> particularly in Serb populated areas of eastern Bosnia, where they partly retaliated against Serbian <a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a> who in fall 1914 had carried out attacks against the Muslim population in the area. The proceedings of the Austro-Hungarian authorities led to around 5,500 citizens of Serb ethnicity in Bosnia and Herzegovina being arrested, and between 700 and 2,200 died in prison while 460 were executed. Around 5,200 Serb families were forcibly expelled from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Following World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over <a href="redistribution%20%28economics%29">property redistribution</a>, and formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions. The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a>s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere. The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslavian kingdom saw few benefits for the Bosniaks; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in Austro-Hungary, Muslims (Bosniaks) owned 91.1%, Orthodox Serbians owned 6.0%, Croatian Catholics owned 2.6% and others, 0.3% of the property. Following the reforms Bosnian Muslims had a total of 1,175,305 hectares of agricultural and forest land taken away from them.

Although the initial split of the country into 33 <a href="oblast">oblast</a>s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as <a href="Mehmed%20Spaho">Mehmed Spaho</a> ensured that the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%23Subdivisions">banates</a> or "<a href="banovina%20%28region%29">banovinas</a>" that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity. Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration.

The <a href="Cvetkovi%C4%87%E2%80%93Ma%C4%8Dek%20Agreement">Cvetković-Maček Agreement</a> that created the <a href="Banovina%20of%20Croatia">Croatian banate</a> in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a <a href="partition%20of%20Bosnia">partition of Bosnia</a> between Croatia and Serbia. However the rising threat of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention. Following a period that saw attempts at <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a>, the signing of the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Treaty</a>, and a <a href="Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>, Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.

Once the kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by Nazi forces in World War II, all of Bosnia was ceded to the Nazi puppet regime, the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (NDH). The NDH leaders embarked on a <a href="World%20War%20II%20persecution%20of%20Serbs">campaign of extermination</a> of <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, Jews, <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a>, Croats who opposed the regime, communists and large numbers of <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>'s <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisans</a> by setting up a number of <a href="Jasenovac%20concentration%20camp">death camps</a>. An estimated 209,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina during the war. The <a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a> recognized both Roman Catholicism and <a href="Islam">Islam</a> as the national religions, but held the position that <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodoxy</a>, as a symbol of Serbian identity, was their greatest foe. Although Croats were by far the largest ethnic group to constitute the Ustaše, the Vice President of the NDH and leader of the Yugoslav Muslim Organization <a href="D%C5%BEafer%20Kulenovi%C4%87">Džafer Kulenović</a> was a Muslim, and Muslims (Bosniaks) in total comprised nearly 12% of the Ustaše military and civil service authority.

Many Serbs themselves took up arms and joined the <a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a>, a Serb nationalist movement with the aim of establishing an ethnically homogeneous '<a href="Greater%20Serbia">Greater Serbia</a>n' state. The Chetniks were responsible for widespread persecution and murder of non-Serbs and communist sympathizers, with the Muslim population of Bosnia, Herzegovina and <a href="Sand%C5%BEak">Sandžak</a> being a primary target. Once captured, Muslim villagers were systematically massacred by the Chetniks. Of the 75,000 Muslims who lost their lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war, approximately 30,000 (mostly civilians) were killed by the Chetniks. Later, a number of Muslims served in Nazi <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">"Waffen-SS"</a> units. Between 64,000 and 79,000 Bosnian Croats also perished from April 1941 to May 1945. Of these, about 18,000 were killed by the Chetniks.

On 12 October 1941, a group of 108 notable Muslim citizens of Sarajevo signed the <a href="Resolution%20of%20Sarajevo%20Muslims">Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims</a> by which they condemned the persecution of Serbs organized by the <a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>, made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and whole Muslim population, presented information about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity.

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the <a href="Partisans%20%28Yugoslavia%29">partisans</a>, who fought against both Axis and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943 the <a href="Anti-Fascist%20Council%20of%20National%20Liberation%20of%20Yugoslavia">Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia</a> with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in <a href="Jajce">Jajce</a> where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Habsburg borders.

Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans, but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead. All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its peoples bore the brunt of fighting. More than 300,000 people died in Bosnia and Herzegovina in World War II. At the end of the war the establishment of the <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>, with the <a href="1946%20Yugoslav%20Constitution">constitution of 1946</a>, officially made Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state.

Due to its central geographic position within the Yugoslavian federation, post-war Bosnia was selected as a base for the development of the <a href="Defense%20%28military%29">military defense</a> industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in <a href="Bosnian%20War">the war that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia</a> in the 1990s. However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was a peaceful and very prosperous country, with high employment, a strong industrial and export oriented economy, good education system and social and medical security for every citizen of S. R. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Several international corporations operated in Bosnia— <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> (car factory in Sarajevo, from 1972), <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> (from 1975), SKF Sweden (from 1967), Marlboro, (a tobacco factory in Sarajevo), and <a href="Holiday%20Inn">Holiday Inn</a> hotels. Sarajevo was the site of the <a href="1984%20Winter%20Olympics">1984 Winter Olympics</a>.

During the 1950s and 1960s Bosnia was a political backwater of the Republic of Yugoslavia. In the 1970s a strong Bosnian political elite arose, fueled in part by Tito's leadership in the <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a> and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia's <a href="diplomatic%20corps">diplomatic corps</a>. While working within the Socialist system, politicians such as <a href="D%C5%BEemal%20Bijedi%C4%87">Džemal Bijedić</a>, <a href="Branko%20Mikuli%C4%87">Branko Mikulić</a> and <a href="Hamdija%20Pozderac">Hamdija Pozderac</a> reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic did not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time. With the fall of the Soviet Union and the start of the break-up of Yugoslavia, doctrine of tolerance began to lose its potency, creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence.

On 18 November 1990, multi-party parliamentary elections were held throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. A second round followed on 25 November, resulting in a <a href="National%20Assembly">national assembly</a> where communist power was replaced by a <a href="coalition">coalition</a> of three ethnically-based parties. Following <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> and <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>'s declarations of independence from Yugoslavia, a significant split developed among the residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the issue of whether to remain within Yugoslavia (overwhelmingly favored by Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored by Bosniaks and Croats).

The Serb members of parliament, consisting mainly of the <a href="Serbian%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%29">Serb Democratic Party</a> members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Republika%20Srpska">Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990. This Assembly established the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, which was renamed <a href="Republika%20Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> in August 1992. On 18 November 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the ruling party in the Republic of Croatia, the <a href="Croatian%20Democratic%20Union">Croatian Democratic Union</a> (HDZ), proclaimed the existence of the <a href="Croatian%20Republic%20of%20Herzeg-Bosnia">Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia</a>, with the <a href="Croatian%20Defence%20Council">Croatian Defence Council</a> (HVO) as its military branch. It went unrecognized by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which declared it illegal.

A declaration of the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 15 October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence on 29 February/1 March 1992, which was boycotted by the great majority of Serbs. The turnout in the independence referendum was 63.4 percent and 99.7 percent of voters voted for independence. Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence on 3 March 1992 and received international recognition the following month on 6 April 1992. The <a href="Republic%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> was subsequently admitted as a member state of the United Nations on 22 May 1992.

Serbian leader <a href="Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Slobodan Milošević</a> and Croatian leader <a href="Franjo%20Tu%C4%91man">Franjo Tuđman</a> are believed to have agreed on a <a href="partition%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> in March 1991, with the aim of establishing <a href="Greater%20Serbia">Greater Serbia</a> and <a href="Greater%20Croatia">Greater Croatia</a>. Following Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of independence, Bosnian Serb militias mobilized in different parts of the country. Government forces were poorly equipped and unprepared for the war. International recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased diplomatic pressure for the <a href="Yugoslav%20People%27s%20Army">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (JNA) to withdraw from the republic's territory, which they officially did in June 1992. The Bosnian Serb members of the JNA simply changed insignia, formed the <a href="Army%20of%20Republika%20Srpska">Army of Republika Srpska</a> (VRS), and continued fighting. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia, supported by volunteers and various <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary forces</a> from Serbia, and receiving extensive humanitarian, logistical and financial support from the <a href="Serbia%20and%20Montenegro">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>, Republika Srpska's offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control. The Bosnian Serb advance was accompanied by the <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> of Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats from VRS-controlled areas. This was accompanied by the establishment of concentration camps, in which inmates were subjected to violence and abuse, including rape. The ethnic cleansing culminated in the <a href="Srebrenica%20massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys in July 1995, which was ruled to have been a <a href="genocide">genocide</a> by the ICTY. Bosniak and Bosnian Croat forces also committed war crimes against civilians from different ethnic groups, though on a smaller scale. Most of the Bosniak and Croat atrocities were committed during the <a href="Bosniak-Croat%20war">Bosniak-Croat war</a>, a sub-conflict of the Bosnian War which pitted the ARBiH against the HVO. The Bosniak-Croat conflict ended in March 1994, with the signing of the <a href="Washington%20Agreement">Washington Agreement</a>, leading to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat <a href="Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, which amalgamated HVO-held territory with that held by the ARBiH.

Following the Srebrenica massacre, <a href="NATO">NATO</a> launched a <a href="Operation%20Deliberate%20Force">bombing campaign</a> against Republika Srpska in August 1995. The bombing, together with a joint HV/HVO/ARBiH ground offensive in western Bosnia, convinced the Bosnian Serb leadership to consider a negotiated settlement, which manifested itself in the <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Agreement</a> of December 1995. The agreement brought an end to active combat and roughly established the basic political structure of the present-day state. A <a href="IFOR">NATO-led peacekeeping force</a> was immediately dispatched to the country to enforce the agreement. An estimated 100,000 people were killed in the war, about two-thirds of whom were Bosniak. An additional 2.2 million citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina of all ethnicities were displaced.

According to a number of <a href="International%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20former%20Yugoslavia">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) judgements, the conflict involved Bosnia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (subsequently <a href="Serbia%20and%20Montenegro">Serbia and Montenegro</a>) as well as <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>. Dozens of Bosnian Serb officials and soldiers have been convicted for their role in war crimes and crimes against humanity during the conflict, as well as for the genocide in Srebrenica. High-ranking Croat and Bosniak officials have also been convicted or indicted for war crimes. The remains of victims are still being unearthed two decades later. After the war, the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina brought a lawsuit against Serbia before the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ), accusing the country of genocide. In 2007, the ICJ exonerated Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica, but concluded that the country had not done enough to prevent the massacre.

On 4 February 2014, the protests against the government of the <a href="Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, one of the country's two entities, dubbed the Bosnian Spring, the name being taken from the <a href="Arab%20Spring">Arab Spring</a>, began in the northern town of <a href="Tuzla">Tuzla</a>. Workers from several factories which were privatised and which have now gone bankrupt united to demand action over jobs, unpaid salaries and pensions. Soon protests spread to the rest of the Federation, with violent clashes reported in close to 20 towns, the biggest of which were <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, <a href="Zenica">Zenica</a>, <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a>, <a href="Biha%C4%87">Bihać</a>, <a href="Br%C4%8Dko">Brčko</a> and Tuzla. The Bosnian news media reported that hundreds of people had been injured during the protests, including dozens of police officers, with bursts of violence in Sarajevo, in the northern city of Tuzla, in Mostar in the south, and in Zenica in central Bosnia. The same level of unrest or activism did not occur in the <a href="Republika%20Srpska">Republika Srpska</a>, but hundreds of people also gathered in support of protests in the town of <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a> against its separate government.

The protests marked the largest outbreak of public anger over high unemployment and two decades of political inertia in the country since the end of the Bosnian War in 1995.

Bosnia is located in the western <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, bordering <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> () to the north and west, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> () to the east, and <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> () to the southeast. It has a coastline about long surrounding the city of <a href="Neum">Neum</a>. It lies between latitudes <a href="42nd%20parallel%20north">42°</a> and <a href="46th%20parallel%20north">46° N</a>, and longitudes <a href="15th%20meridian%20east">15°</a> and <a href="20th%20meridian%20east">20° E</a>.

The country's name comes from the two regions <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> and <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>, which have a very vaguely defined border between them. Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four-fifths of the entire country, while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the southern part of the country.

The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central <a href="Dinaric%20Alps">Dinaric Alps</a>. The northeastern parts reach into the <a href="Pannonian%20Plain">Pannonian Plain</a>, while in the south it borders the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a>. The Dinaric Alps generally run in a southeast-northwest direction, and get higher towards the south. The highest point of the country is the peak of <a href="Magli%C4%87%20%28mountain%29">Maglić</a> at , on the Montenegrin border. Major mountains include <a href="Kozara">Kozara</a>, <a href="Grme%C4%8D">Grmeč</a>, <a href="Vla%C5%A1i%C4%87%20%28Bosnian%20mountain%29">Vlašić</a>, <a href="%C4%8Cvrsnica%20Mountain">Čvrsnica</a>, <a href="Prenj">Prenj</a>, <a href="Romanija">Romanija</a>, <a href="Jahorina">Jahorina</a>, <a href="Bjela%C5%A1nica%20Mountain">Bjelašnica</a> and <a href="Treskavica">Treskavica</a>.

Overall, close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in the centre, east and west parts of Bosnia. Herzegovina has drier Mediterranean climate, with dominant <a href="karst">karst</a> topography. Northern Bosnia (<a href="Posavina">Posavina</a>) contains very fertile agricultural land along the River Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Pannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The country has only of coastline, around the town of <a href="Neum">Neum</a> in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by international law, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a <a href="right%20of%20passage">right of passage</a> to the outer sea.

<a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> is the capital and largest city. Other major cities are <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a> in the northwest region known as <a href="Bosanska%20Krajina">Bosanska Krajina</a>, <a href="Bijeljina">Bijeljina</a> and <a href="Tuzla">Tuzla</a> in the northeast, <a href="Zenica">Zenica</a> and <a href="Doboj">Doboj</a> in the central part of Bosnia and <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a>, the largest city in <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>.

There are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina:


<a href="Phytogeography">Phytogeographically</a>, Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the <a href="Boreal%20Kingdom">Boreal Kingdom</a> and is shared between the Illyrian province of the <a href="Circumboreal%20Region">Circumboreal Region</a> and Adriatic province of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean Region</a>. According to the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a>, the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a>s: the Pannonian <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">mixed forests</a>, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian <a href="deciduous">deciduous forests</a>.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democracy</a>. It has several levels of political structuring, according to the <a href="Dayton%20accord">Dayton accord</a>. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: <a href="Republika%20Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> and the <a href="Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996, the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves. The <a href="Br%C4%8Dko%20District">Brčko District</a> in the north of the country was created in 2000, out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Brčko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Brčko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.

The third level of Bosnia and Herzegovina's political subdivision is manifested in <a href="Cantons%20of%20the%20Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">cantons</a>. They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. All of them have their own cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws implemented to ensure the equality of all constituent people.

The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipalities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided in 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska in 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the <a href="Inter-Entity%20Boundary%20Line">Inter-Entity Boundary Line</a>. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.

Besides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four "official" cities. These are: <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a>, <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a>, <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, and <a href="Isto%C4%8Dno%20Sarajevo">East Sarajevo</a>. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).

As a result of the <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Accords</a>, the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the <a href="High%20Representative%20for%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> selected by the <a href="Peace%20Implementation%20Council">Peace Implementation Council</a>. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as <a href="defence%20minister">defense ministry</a>, security ministry, state court, <a href="indirect%20tax">indirect tax</a>ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state.

The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.

The Chair of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> rotates among three members (<a href="Bosniaks">Bosniak</a>, <a href="Serbs">Serb</a>, <a href="Croats">Croat</a>), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Presidency</a> are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the <a href="Republika%20Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> voters for the Serb.

The Chair of the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Council of Ministers</a> is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.

The <a href="Parliamentary%20Assembly%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Parliamentary Assembly</a> is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the <a href="House%20of%20Peoples%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">House of Peoples</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">House of Representatives</a>. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.

The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.

However, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a> for the international civilian presence in the country and is selected by the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic. International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.

The <a href="Armed%20Forces%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and the <a href="Army%20of%20Republika%20Srpska">Army of Republika Srpska</a>, which had defended their respective regions. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Ministry of Defense</a> was founded in 2004.

The Bosnian military consists of the <a href="Bosnian%20Ground%20Forces">Bosnian Ground Forces</a> and <a href="Air%20Force%20and%20Anti-Aircraft%20Defence%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Air Force and Air Defense</a>. The Ground Forces number 14,725 active and 7,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces have 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate <a href="MANPAD">MANPAD</a> hand-held missiles, <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a> (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. The Army has recently adopted remodeled <a href="MARPAT">MARPAT</a> uniforms, used by Bosnian soldiers serving with <a href="ISAF">ISAF</a> in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. A domestic production program is now underway to ensure that army units are equipped with the correct ammunition.

Beginning in 2007, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> undertook the army's first ever international assistance mission, enlisting the military to serve with <a href="International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">ISAF</a> peace missions to <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> and the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> in 2007. Five officers, acting as officers/advisors, served in the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>. 45 soldiers, mostly acting as base security and medical assistants, served in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. 85 Bosnian soldiers served as base security in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, occasionally conducting infantry patrols there as well. All three deployed groups have been commended by their respective international forces as well as the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. The international assistance operations are still ongoing.

The Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and the <a href="Republika%20Srpska%20Air%20Force">Republika Srpska Air Force</a> were merged in 2006. The <a href="Air%20Force">Air Force</a> has seen improvements in the last few years with added funds for aircraft repairs and improved cooperation with the <a href="Ground%20Forces">Ground Forces</a> as well as to the citizens of the country. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> is currently pursuing the acquisition of new aircraft including helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.

<a href="Accession%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20to%20the%20European%20Union">EU integration</a> is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it initiated the <a href="Stabilisation%20and%20Association%20Process">Stabilisation and Association Process</a> in 2007. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, Member States of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession. The implementation of the <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Accords</a> of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">former Yugoslavia</a>. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, relations with its neighbors of <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> have been fairly stable since the signing of the <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Agreement</a> in 1995.

On 23 April 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina received the <a href="Membership%20Action%20Plan">Membership Action Plan</a> from <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, which is the last step before full membership in the alliance. Full membership was expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.

They are also a member of the <a href="Group%20of%2077">Group of 77</a>.

According to the <a href="1991%20population%20census%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">1991 census</a>, Bosnia and Herzegovina had a population of 4,377,000, while the 1996 UNHCR unofficial census showed a decrease to 3,920,000. Large population migrations during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s have caused demographic shifts in the country. Between 1991 and 2013, political disagreements made it impossible to organize a census. A census had been planned for 2011, and then for 2012, but was delayed until October 2013. The <a href="2013%20population%20census%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">2013 census</a> found a total population of 3,791,622 people in 1.16 million households; 585,411 fewer people than the 1991 census.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to three ethnic "<a href="Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">constituent peoples</a>", who are Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats, plus a number of smaller groups including <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Jews</a> and <a href="Romani%20people%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Roma</a>. According to data from <a href="2013%20population%20census%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">2013 census</a> published by the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosniaks constitute 50.11% of the population, Serbs 30.78%, Croats 15.43%, and others form 2.73%, with the remaining respondents not declaring their ethnicity or not answering. The census results are contested by the Republika Srpska statistical office and by Bosnian Serb politicians. The dispute over the census concerns the inclusion of non-permanent Bosnian residents in the figures, which Republika Srpska officials oppose. The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>'s statistics office, <a href="Eurostat">Eurostat</a>, concluded in May 2016 that the census methodology used by the Bosnian statistical agency is in line with international recommendations.

According to the 2013 census, <a href="Islam">Islam</a> is the majority faith in Bosnia and Herzegovina, making up 51% of the population, and the vast majority belong to <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a>. 46% of the population identify as <a href="Christian">Christian</a>; of these, the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> makes up the largest group, accounting for 31% of the population (of whom most identify as <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>), and the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> 15% (of whom most identify as <a href="Croats">Croats</a>). The smallest groups are <a href="Agnosticism">Agnosticism</a> 0.3%, <a href="Atheism">Atheism</a> 0.8% and other 1.15%, with the remainder not declaring their religion or not answering 1.1%. A 2012 survey found that 54% of Bosnia's <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s are <a href="non-denominational%20Muslim">non-denominational Muslim</a>s, while 38% follow <a href="Sunnism">Sunnism</a>.

Bosnia's constitution does not specify any official languages. However, academics Hilary Footitt and Michael Kelly note that the Dayton Agreement states that it is "done in <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a>, <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a>, English and <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a>", and they describe this as the "de facto recognition of three official languages" at the state level. The equal status of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian was verified by the Constitutional Court in 2000. It ruled that the provisions of the Federation and Republika Srpska constitutions on language were incompatible with the state constitution, since they only recognised "Bosniak" and Croatian (in the case of the Federation) and Serbian (in the case of Republika Srpska) as official languages at the entity level. As a result, the wording of the entity constitutions was changed and all three languages were made official in both entities. The three languages are <a href="Mutual%20intelligibility">mutually intelligible</a> and were previously known collectively as <a href="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a>. Use of one of the three languages has become a marker of ethnic identity. Michael Kelly and Catherine Baker argue: "The three official languages of today's Bosnian state...represent the symbolic assertion of national identity over the pragmatism of mutual intelligibility".

According to the 1992 <a href="European%20Charter%20for%20Regional%20or%20Minority%20Languages">European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</a>, Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the following minority languages: <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a>, <a href="Montenegrin%20language">Montenegrin</a>, <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a>, <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, <a href="Romani%20language">Romani</a>, <a href="Romanian%20language">Romanian</a>, <a href="Rysin">Rysin</a>, <a href="Slovak%20language">Slovak</a>, <a href="Slovene%20language">Slovene</a>, <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>, <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> and Jewish (<a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> and <a href="Judaeo-Spanish">Ladino</a>). The German minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mostly remnants of <a href="Donauschwaben">Donauschwaben</a> (Danube Swabians), who settled in the area after the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Habsburg monarchy</a> claimed the Balkans from the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Due to <a href="Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans">expulsions</a> and <a href="Organised%20persecution%20of%20ethnic%20Germans">(forced) assimilation</a> after the two <a href="World%20War">World War</a>s, the number of ethnic Germans in Bosnia and Herzegovina was drastically diminshed.

According to the results of the 2013 census, 52.86% of the population consider their mother tongue to be Bosnian, 30.76% Serbian, 14.6% Croatian and 1.57% another language, with 0.21% not giving an answer.

<a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> is home to 438,443 inhabitants in its urban area.

Bosnia faces the dual-problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing transitional liberal market reforms to its formerly mixed economy. One legacy of the previous era is a strong industry; under former republic president <a href="D%C5%BEemal%20Bijedi%C4%87">Džemal Bijedić</a> and SFRY President <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>, metal industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's plants; S.R. Bosnia and Herzegovina had a very strong industrial export oriented economy in the 1970s and 1980s, with large scale exports worth millions of <a href="US%24">US$</a>.

For most of Bosnia's history, agriculture has been conducted on privately owned farms; Fresh food has traditionally been exported from the republic.

The war in the 1990s, caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy. GDP fell by 60% and the destruction of physical infrastructure devastated the economy. With much of the production capacity unrestored, the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties. Figures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004; this and Bosnia's shrinking <a href="Government%20debt">national debt</a> being negative trends, and high unemployment 38.7% and a large <a href="Balance%20of%20trade">trade deficit</a> remain cause for concern.

The national currency is the (Euro-pegged) <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20convertible%20mark">Convertible Mark</a> (KM), controlled by the <a href="currency%20board">currency board</a>. Annual inflation is the lowest relative to other countries in the region at 1.9% in 2004. The international debt was $5.1 billion (as on 31 December 2014) . <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">Real GDP</a> growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Central Bank of BiH</a> and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has displayed positive progress in the previous years, which decisively moved its place from the lowest income equality rank of <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20income%20equality">income equality rankings</a> fourteen out of 193 nations.

According to <a href="Eurostat">Eurostat</a> data, Bosnia and Herzegovina's PPS GDP per capita stood at 29 per cent of the EU average in 2010.

The <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) announced a loan to Bosnia worth US$500 million to be delivered by <a href="IMF%20Stand-By%20Arrangement">Stand-By Arrangement</a>. This was scheduled to be approved in September 2012.

Higher education has a long and rich tradition in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first bespoke higher-education institution was a school of <a href="Sufism">Sufi</a> philosophy established by <a href="Gazi%20Husrev-beg">Gazi Husrev-beg</a> in 1531. Numerous other religious schools then followed. In 1887, under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a <a href="Sharia">Sharia</a> law school began a five-year program. In the 1940s the <a href="University%20of%20Sarajevo">University of Sarajevo</a> became the city's first secular higher education institute. In the 1950s post-bachelaurate graduate degrees became available. Severely damaged during the war, it was recently rebuilt in partnership with more than 40 other universities. There are various other institutions of higher education, including: <a href="University%20%26quot%3BD%C5%BEemal%20Bijedi%C4%87%26quot%3B%20of%20Mostar">University "Džemal Bijedić" of Mostar</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Banja%20Luka">University of Banja Luka</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Mostar">University of Mostar</a>, <a href="University%20of%20East%20Sarajevo">University of East Sarajevo</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Tuzla">University of Tuzla</a>, <a href="American%20University%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and the <a href="Academy%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Arts%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, which is held in high regard as one of the most prestigious creative arts academies in the region.

Also, Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to several private and international higher education institutions, some of which are:


Primary schooling lasts for nine years. Secondary education is provided by general and technical secondary schools (typically <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">Gymnasiums</a>) where studies typically last for four years. All forms of secondary schooling include an element of <a href="vocational%20education">vocational training</a>. Pupils graduating from general secondary schools obtain the <a href="Matura">Matura</a> and can enroll in any tertiary educational institution or academy by passing a qualification examination prescribed by the governing body or institution. Students graduating technical subjects obtain a <a href="Diploma">Diploma</a>.

The architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely influenced by four major periods where political and social changes influenced the creation of distinct cultural and architectural habits of the population. Each period made its influence felt and contributed to a greater diversity of cultures and architectural language in this region.

Television, magazines, and newspapers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on <a href="advertising">advertising</a>, <a href="subscription">subscription</a>, and other sales-related revenues. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> guarantees <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>.

As a <a href="country%20in%20transition">country in transition</a> with a post-war legacy and a <a href="politics%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">complex domestic political structure</a> Bosnia and Herzegovina's media system is under transformation. In the early post-war period (1995–2005), media development was guided mainly by international donors and cooperation agencies, who invested to help reconstruct, diversify, democratize and professionalize media outlets.

Post-war developments included the establishment of an independent Communication Regulatory Agency, the adoption of a Press Code, the establishment of the Press Council, the decriminalization of label and defamation, the introduction of a rather advanced Freedom of Access to Information Law, and the creation of a Public Service Broadcasting System from the formerly state-owned broadcaster.
Yet, internationally backed positive developments have been often obstructed by domestic elites, and the professionalisation of media and journalists has proceeded only slowly. High levels of partisanship and linkages between the media and the political systems hinder the adherence to professional code of conducts.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literature, including the <a href="Nobel%20prize">Nobel prize</a> winner <a href="Ivo%20Andri%C4%87">Ivo Andrić</a> and poets such as Croat <a href="Antun%20Branko%20%C5%A0imi%C4%87">Antun Branko Šimić</a>, <a href="Aleksa%20%C5%A0anti%C4%87">Aleksa Šantić</a>, <a href="Jovan%20Du%C4%8Di%C4%87">Jovan Dučić</a> and <a href="Mak%20Dizdar">Mak Dizdar</a>, writers such as <a href="Zlatko%20Top%C4%8Di%C4%87">Zlatko Topčić</a>, <a href="Me%C5%A1a%20Selimovi%C4%87">Meša Selimović</a>, <a href="Semezdin%20Mehmedinovi%C4%87">Semezdin Mehmedinović</a>, <a href="Miljenko%20Jergovi%C4%87">Miljenko Jergović</a>, <a href="Isak%20Samokovlija">Isak Samokovlija</a>, <a href="Safvet%20beg%20Ba%C5%A1agi%C4%87">Safvet beg Bašagić</a>, <a href="Abdulah%20Sidran">Abdulah Sidran</a>, <a href="Petar%20Ko%C4%8Di%C4%87">Petar Kočić</a>, <a href="Aleksandar%20Hemon">Aleksandar Hemon</a>, and Nedžad Ibrišimović. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was the dramatist <a href="Branislav%20Nu%C5%A1i%C4%87">Branislav Nušić</a>.
Magazines such as "<a href="Novi%20Plamen">Novi Plamen</a>" or "<a href="http%3A//sveske.ba/en">Sarajevske sveske</a>" are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.

The art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called <a href="Ste%C4%87ci">Stećci</a> to paintings in <a href="House%20of%20Kotromani%C4%87">Kotromanić</a> court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: <a href="Gabrijel%20Jurki%C4%87">Gabrijel Jurkić</a>, <a href="Petar%20%C5%A0ain">Petar Šain</a>, <a href="Roman%20Petrovi%C4%87">Roman Petrović</a> and <a href="Lazar%20Drlja%C4%8Da">Lazar Drljača</a>.

After World War II artists like <a href="Mersad%20Berber">Mersad Berber</a> and <a href="Safet%20Zec">Safet Zec</a> rose in popularity.

In 2007, <a href="Ars%20Aevi">Ars Aevi</a>, a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.

Typical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are "ganga, rera", and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as "<a href="kolo%20%28dance%29">kolo</a>" and from Ottoman era the most popular is <a href="sevdalinka">sevdalinka</a>. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including <a href="Dino%20Zoni%C4%87">Dino Zonić</a>, <a href="Goran%20Bregovi%C4%87">Goran Bregović</a>, <a href="Davorin%20Popovi%C4%87">Davorin Popović</a>, <a href="Kemal%20Monteno">Kemal Monteno</a>, <a href="Zdravko%20%C4%8Coli%C4%87">Zdravko Čolić</a>, <a href="Elvir%20Lakovi%C4%87">Elvir Laković</a>, <a href="Edo%20Maajka">Edo Maajka</a>, <a href="Hari%20Mata%20Hari">Hari Mata Hari</a> and <a href="Dino%20Merlin">Dino Merlin</a>.

Probably the most distinctive and identifiably "Bosnian" of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a <a href="saz%20%28musical%20instrument%29">saz</a>, a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.

Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, <a href="garlic">garlic</a>, <a href="capsicum">peppers</a>, <a href="cucumber">cucumber</a>s, carrots, <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a>, <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s, <a href="spinach">spinach</a>, <a href="zucchini">zucchini</a>, <a href="bean">dried beans</a>, fresh beans, <a href="plum">plum</a>s, milk, <a href="paprika">paprika</a> and cream called <a href="Smetana%20%28dairy%20product%29">Pavlaka</a>. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between <a href="Western%20culture">Western</a> and <a href="Eastern%20world">Eastern</a> influences. As a result of the <a href="Turkish%20cuisine">Ottoman</a> administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to <a href="Turkish%20cuisine">Turkish</a>, <a href="Greek%20cuisine">Greek</a>, and other former <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20cuisine">Mediterranean</a> cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and <a href="lamb%20and%20mutton">lamb</a>. Some local specialties are <a href="%C4%86evap%C4%8Di%C4%87i">ćevapi</a>, <a href="burek">burek</a>, <a href="dolma">dolma</a>, <a href="sarma%20%28food%29">sarma</a>, <a href="pilav">pilav</a>, <a href="goulash">goulash</a>, <a href="ajvar">ajvar</a> and a whole range of Eastern sweets. Ćevapi is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of <a href="kebab">kebab</a>, popular in former Yugoslavia and considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. Local wines come from <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a> where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Herzegovinian "loza" (similar to Italian <a href="Grappa">Grappa</a> but less sweet) is very popular. Plum ("rakija") or apple ("jabukovača") alcohol beverages are produced in the north. In the south, distilleries used to produce vast quantities of <a href="brandy">brandy</a> and supply all of ex-Yugoslav alcohol factories (brandy is the base of most <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcoholic drinks</a>).

Coffeehouses, where <a href="Bosnian%20coffee">Bosnian coffee</a> is served in <a href="cezve">džezva</a> with <a href="Turkish%20Delight">rahat lokum</a> and sugar cubes, proliferate <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> and every city in the country. Coffee drinking is a favorite Bosnian pastime and part of the culture. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the tenth country in the entire world by per capita coffee consumption.

Botswana

Botswana (), officially the Republic of Botswana (), is a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a> located in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as "Batswana" (singular: "Motswana"). Formerly the British <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> of <a href="Bechuanaland%20Protectorate">Bechuanaland</a>, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> on 30 September 1966. Since then, it has maintained a strong tradition of stable <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democracy</a>, with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic <a href="Elections%20in%20Botswana">elections</a> and the best perceived corruption ranking in Africa for the last four years.

Botswana is topographically flat, with up to 70 percent of its territory being the <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a>. It is bordered by <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> to the south and southeast, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> to the west and north, and <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> to the northeast. Its border with <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> to the north near <a href="Kazungula%2C%20Zambia">Kazungula</a> is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred metres long.

A mid-sized country of just over 2 million people, Botswana is one of the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20population%20density">most sparsely populated</a> nations in the world. Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, <a href="Gaborone">Gaborone</a>. Formerly one of the poorest countries in the world—with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s—Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The economy is dominated by <a href="Mining%20industry%20of%20Botswana">mining</a>, cattle, and <a href="Tourism%20in%20Botswana">tourism</a>. Botswana boasts a GDP (<a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a>) per capita of about $18,825 per year , which is one of the highest in Africa. Its high <a href="gross%20national%20income">gross national income</a> (by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa) gives the country a modest standard of living and the highest <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a> of continental <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>.

Botswana is a member of the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a>, the <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">Southern African Development Community</a>, the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, and the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. The country has been among the hardest hit by the <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20Botswana">HIV/AIDS epidemic</a>. The death rate due to AIDS or AIDS-related causes has fallen sharply (57%) from 2005 to 2013, and the number of new infections in children has also fallen. Despite the success in programmes to make treatments available to those infected, and to educate the populace in general about how to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, the number of people with AIDS rose from 290,000 in 2005 to 320,000 in 2013. As of 2014, Botswana has the third-highest prevalence rate for HIV/AIDS.

The history of Botswana starts more than 100,000 years ago, when the first humans inhabited the region. The original inhabitants of southern Africa were the Bushmen (<a href="San%20people">San</a>) and <a href="Khoi">Khoi</a> peoples. Both speak <a href="Khoisan%20languages">Khoisan languages</a> and lived as <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s. About a thousand years ago, large chiefdoms emerged that were later eclipsed by the <a href="Great%20Zimbabwe">Great Zimbabwe</a> empire, which spread into eastern Botswana.

Around 1300 CE, peoples in present-day <a href="Transvaal%20Province">Transvaal</a> began to coalesce into three main linguistic and political groups, including the Batswana. The Batswana (plural of "Motswana"), a term used also to denote all citizens of Botswana, remain the country's major ethnic group today. Prior to European contact, the Batswana lived as herders and farmers under tribal rule. As groups broke off and moved to new land, new tribes were created. Some human development occurred before the colonial period.

During the 1700s, the <a href="slavery%20in%20Africa">slave</a> and <a href="ivory%20trade">ivory trade</a>s were expanding. To resist these pressures, <a href="Shaka">Shaka</a>, the king of the <a href="Zulu%20Empire">Zulu Empire</a>, mobilised an army. Conquered tribes began to move northwest into Botswana, destroying everything in their path. In their efforts to re-establish themselves at the end of this period, tribes began to exchange ivory and skins for guns with European traders, who had begun to reach the interior. <a href="Christian%20mission">Christian mission</a>aries sent from Europe also spread to the interior, often at the invitation of tribal chiefs who wanted guns and knew that the presence of missionaries encouraged traders. By 1880 every major village had a resident missionary, and their influence became permanent. <a href="Christianization">Christianization</a> was completed in Botswana under the reign of king <a href="Khama%20III">Khama III</a> (reigned 1875–1923). There were eight principal tribes (or chiefdoms); the dominant was the <a href="Bangwaketse">Bangwaketse</a>.

In the late nineteenth century, hostilities broke out between <a href="Tswana%20people">Tswana</a> inhabitants of Botswana and <a href="Southern%20Ndebele%20people">Ndebele</a> tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the north-east. Tensions also escalated with the Dutch <a href="Boer">Boer</a> settlers from the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a> to the east. After appeals by the Batswana leaders Khama III, <a href="Bathoen">Bathoen</a> and <a href="Sebele">Sebele</a> for assistance, supported by Scottish missionary <a href="John%20Mackenzie%20%28missionary%29">John Mackenzie</a>, the British Government put Bechuanaland under its protection on 31 March 1885. The northern territory remained under direct administration as the <a href="Bechuanaland%20Protectorate">Bechuanaland Protectorate</a>; it gained independence as modern-day Botswana. The southern territory, <a href="British%20Bechuanaland">British Bechuanaland</a>, became part of the <a href="British%20Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a> and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa. The majority of <a href="Setswana">Setswana</a>-speaking people today live in South Africa.
When the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> was formed in 1910 from the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, <a href="Basutoland">Basutoland</a> (now <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>), and <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a> (the High Commission Territories) were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, the UK began to consult with their inhabitants as to their wishes. Although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred to their jurisdiction, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">Nationalist</a> government in 1948, which instituted <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>, and South Africa's withdrawal from the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> in 1961, ended any prospect of the UK or these territories agreeing to incorporation into South Africa.

An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans. The African Council consisted of the eight heads of the Tswana tribes and some elected members. Proclamations in 1934 regulated tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.

In June 1964, the United Kingdom accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from <a href="Mafikeng">Mafikeng</a> in South Africa, to the newly established <a href="Gaborone">Gaborone</a>, which is located near Botswana's border with South Africa. Based on the 1965 constitution, the country held its first general elections under universal suffrage and gained independence on 30 September 1966. <a href="Seretse%20Khama">Seretse Khama</a>, a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the <a href="Bamangwato">Ngwato</a> chiefship, was elected as the first President, and subsequently re-elected twice.

The presidency passed to the sitting Vice-President, <a href="Quett%20Masire">Quett Masire</a>, who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. He was succeeded by <a href="Festus%20Mogae">Festus Mogae</a>, who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to <a href="Ian%20Khama">Ian Khama</a> (son of the first President), who had been serving as Mogae's Vice-President since resigning his position in 1998 as Commander of the <a href="Botswana%20Defence%20Force">Botswana Defence Force</a> to take up this civilian role.

A long-running dispute over the northern border with <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>'s <a href="Caprivi%20Strip">Caprivi Strip</a> was the subject of a ruling by the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court of Justice</a> in December 1999. It ruled that <a href="Kasikili%20Island">Kasikili Island</a> belongs to Botswana.

At Botswana is the world's 48th-largest country. It is similar in size to <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> or <a href="France">France</a>. It lies between latitudes <a href="17th%20parallel%20south">17°</a> and <a href="27th%20parallel%20south">27°S</a>, and longitudes <a href="20th%20meridian%20east">20°</a> and <a href="30th%20meridian%20east">30°E</a>.

The country is predominantly flat, tending toward gently rolling <a href="plateau">tableland</a>. Botswana is dominated by the <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a>, which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The <a href="Okavango%20Delta">Okavango Delta</a>, one of the world's largest inland <a href="River%20deltas">delta</a>s, is in the northwest. The <a href="Makgadikgadi%20Pan">Makgadikgadi Pan</a>, a large <a href="salt%20pan%20%28geology%29">salt pan</a>, lies in the north.

The <a href="Limpopo%20River">Limpopo River</a> Basin, the major landform of all of southern Africa, lies partly in Botswana, with the basins of its tributaries, the <a href="Notwane%20River">Notwane</a>, <a href="Bonwapitse%20River">Bonwapitse</a>, <a href="Mahalapswe%20River">Mahalapswe</a>, <a href="Lotsane%20River">Lotsane</a>, <a href="Motloutse%20River">Motloutse</a> and the <a href="Shashe%20River">Shashe</a>, located in the eastern part of the country. The Notwane provides water to the capital through the <a href="Gaborone%20Dam">Gaborone Dam</a>. The <a href="Cuando%20River">Chobe River</a> lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and Namibia's <a href="Zambezi%20Region">Zambezi Region</a>. The Chobe River meets with the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi River</a> at a place called <a href="Kazungula">Kazungula</a> (meaning a small <a href="sausage%20tree">sausage tree</a>, a point where <a href="Sebitwane">Sebitwane</a> and his <a href="Makololo">Makololo tribe</a> crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).

Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s and <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s, where <a href="blue%20wildebeest">blue wildebeest</a>, <a href="antelope">antelope</a>s, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered <a href="African%20wild%20dog">African wild dog</a>. <a href="Chobe%20National%20Park">Chobe National Park</a>, found in the <a href="Chobe%20District">Chobe District</a>, has the world's largest concentration of <a href="African%20bush%20elephant">African elephant</a>s. The park covers about and supports about 350 species of birds.

The Chobe National Park and <a href="Moremi%20Game%20Reserve">Moremi Game Reserve</a> (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the <a href="Central%20Kalahari%20Game%20Reserve">Central Kalahari Game Reserve</a> located in the Kalahari desert in <a href="Ghanzi%20District">Ghanzi District</a>; <a href="Makgadikgadi%20Pans%20National%20Park">Makgadikgadi Pans National Park</a> and <a href="Nxai%20Pan%20National%20Park">Nxai Pan National Park</a> are in <a href="Central%20District%20%28Botswana%29">Central District</a> in the <a href="Makgadikgadi%20Pan">Makgadikgadi Pan</a>. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned: located where the <a href="Shashe%20River">Shashe River</a> and Limpopo River meet in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is <a href="Mokolodi%20Nature%20Reserve">Mokolodi Nature Reserve</a> near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like the Khama Rhino Sanctuary (for <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for <a href="flamingo">flamingo</a>s). They are both located in Central District.

Botswana faces two major <a href="Natural%20environment">environment</a>al problems: drought and <a href="desertification">desertification</a>. The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country. Three quarters of the country's human and animal populations depend on groundwater due to drought. <a href="Groundwater">Groundwater</a> use through deep borehole drilling has somewhat eased the effects of drought. Surface water is scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall. In the remaining 95% of the country, raising livestock is the primary source of rural income. Approximately 71% of the country's land is used for communal <a href="grazing">grazing</a>, which has been a major cause of the desertification and the accelerating soil erosion of the country.

Since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana, they continue to exploit the land. The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase. From 1966 to 1991, the livestock population has increased from 1.7 million to 5.5 million. Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, nearly a 200% increase. "Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is currently the largest single source of rural income." "Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing, or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use. Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change."

Environmentalists report that the <a href="Okavango%20Delta">Okavango Delta</a> is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock. The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana and one of the largest inland deltas in the world; it is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.

The Department of Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement a project to reintroduce indigenous vegetation into communities in Kgalagadi South, Kweneng North and Boteti. Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land. The <a href="United%20States%20Government">United States Government</a> has also entered into an agreement with Botswana, giving them $7 million US dollars to reduce Botswana's debt by $8.3 million US dollars. The stipulation of the US reducing Botswana's debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive <a href="Conservation%20biology">conservation</a> of the land.

The <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> claims that poverty is a major problem behind the <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a> of resources, including land, in Botswana. To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana. The purpose of the project is to draw from "indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems". The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, to draw them in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty. The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development

The constitution of Botswana is the <a href="rule%20of%20law">rule of law</a> which protects the citizens of Botswana and represents their rights. The politics of Botswana take place in a framework of a <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democratic</a> republic, whereby the <a href="President%20of%20Botswana">President of Botswana</a> is both <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>, and of a <a href="multi-party%20system">multi-party system</a>. <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the government. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the government and the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Botswana">Parliament of Botswana</a>. <a href="Botswana%20general%20election%2C%202014">The most recent election</a>, its eleventh, was held on 24 October 2014. Since independence was declared, the party system has been dominated by the <a href="Botswana%20Democratic%20Party">Botswana Democratic Party</a>.

The <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature. Botswana ranks 30th out of 167 states in the 2012 <a href="Democracy%20Index">Democracy Index</a>. According to <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a>, Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and ranks close to Portugal and South Korea.

It consists of a typical court system of local Magistrates Courts, a High Court and a Court of Appeal. The High Court is a superior court of record with unlimited original jurisdiction to hear and determine any criminal, civil or constitutional cases under any law. Appeals can be heard by the Court of Appeal. The Head of the High Court is the Chief Justice.

The Court of Appeal is the highest and final court in the country and deals with appeals from the High Court and the Industrial Court. The Head of the Court of Appeal is the Judge President.

Judges are appointed by the President of Botswana on the recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission.

Chief Justices:


At the time of independence, Botswana had no armed forces. It was only after the <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>n and <a href="South%20African%20Army">South African</a> militaries struck respectively against the <a href="Zimbabwe%20People%27s%20Revolutionary%20Army">Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army</a> and <a href="Umkhonto%20we%20Sizwe">Umkhonto we Sizwe</a> bases that the <a href="Botswana%20Defence%20Force">Botswana Defence Force</a> (BDF) was formed in 1977. The President is <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the armed forces and appoints a defence council and the BDF currently consists of roughly 12,000 servicemen.

Following political changes in South Africa and the region, the BDF's missions have increasingly focused on prevention of <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, <a href="Emergency%20management">preparing for disasters</a>, and foreign <a href="peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a>. The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF, and a large segment of its officer corps have received U.S. training. The Botswana government gave the United States permission to explore the possibility of establishing an Africa Command (<a href="United%20States%20Africa%20Command">AFRICOM</a>) base in the country.

Many of the indigenous <a href="San%20people">San people</a> have been forcibly relocated from their land onto reservations. To make them relocate, they were denied from accessing water from their land and faced arrest if they hunted, which was their primary source of food. Their lands lie in the middle of the world's richest <a href="diamond">diamond</a> field. Officially, the government denies that there is any link to mining and claims the relocation is to preserve the wildlife and ecosystem, even though the San people have lived sustainably on the land for millennia. On the reservations, they struggle to find employment and <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a> is rampant.

<a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Botswana">Homosexual acts</a> are illegal in Botswana, as in many African countries.

Botswana's nine districts are: <a href="Southern%20District%20%28Botswana%29">Southern District</a>, <a href="South-East%20District%20%28Botswana%29">South-East District</a>, <a href="Kweneng%20District">Kweneng District</a>, <a href="Kgatleng%20District">Kgatleng District</a>, <a href="Central%20District%20%28Botswana%29">Central District</a> (<a href="Central%20Serowe/Palapye">Central Serowe/Palapye</a>, <a href="Central%20Mahalapye">Central Mahalapye</a>, <a href="Central%20Bobonong">Central Bobonong</a>, <a href="Central%20Boteti">Central Boteti</a> and <a href="Central%20Tutume">Central Tutume</a>), <a href="North-East%20District%20%28Botswana%29">North-East District</a>, <a href="North-West%20District%20%28Botswana%29">North-West District</a> (<a href="Ngamiland%20District">Ngamiland District</a>, <a href="Okavango%20District">Okavango District</a> and <a href="Chobe%20District">Chobe District</a>), <a href="Ghanzi%20District">Ghanzi District</a> and <a href="Kgalagadi%20District">Kgalagadi District</a> (<a href="Kgalagadi%20South%20District">Kgalagadi South District</a> and <a href="Kgalagadi%20North%20District">Kgalagadi North District</a>).

Botswana's councils created from urban or town councils are: <a href="Gaborone">Gaborone City</a>, <a href="Francistown">Francistown</a>, <a href="Lobatse">Lobatse Town</a>, <a href="Selebi-Phikwe">Selebi-Phikwe Town</a>, <a href="Jwaneng">Jwaneng Town</a>, <a href="Orapa">Orapa Town</a> and <a href="Sowa%2C%20Botswana">Sowa Township</a>.

Since independence, Botswana has had one of the fastest growth rates in per capita income in the world. Botswana has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country. Although Botswana was resource-abundant, a good institutional framework allowed the country to reinvest resource-income in order to generate stable future income. By one estimate, it has the fourth highest <a href="gross%20national%20income">gross national income</a> at <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a> in Africa, giving it a standard of living around that of Mexico.

The <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130823203723/http%3A//www.mti.gov.bw/">Ministry of Trade and Industry of Botswana</a> is responsible for promoting <a href="business%20development">business development</a> throughout the country. According to the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>, economic growth averaged over 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Botswana has a <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20economic%20freedom">high level of economic freedom</a> compared to other African countries. The government has maintained a sound <a href="fiscal%20policy">fiscal policy</a>, despite consecutive <a href="Government%20budget%20deficit">budget deficits</a> in 2002 and 2003, and a negligible level of <a href="External%20debt">foreign debt</a>. It earned the highest sovereign <a href="credit%20rating">credit rating</a> in Africa and has stockpiled foreign exchange reserves (over $7 billion in 2005/2006) amounting to almost two and a half years of current imports.

An array of financial institutions populates the country's financial system, with pension funds and commercial banks being the two most important segments by asset size. Banks remain profitable, well-capitalised, and liquid, as a result of growing national resources and high interest rates. The <a href="Bank%20of%20Botswana">Bank of Botswana</a> serves as a <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a>. The country's currency is the <a href="Botswana%20pula">Botswana pula</a>.

Botswana's competitive banking system is one of Africa's most advanced. Generally adhering to global standards in the transparency of financial policies and banking supervision, the financial sector provides ample access to credit for entrepreneurs. The Capital Bank opened in 2008. As of August 2015, there are a dozen licensed banks in the country. The government is involved in banking through state-owned financial institutions and a special financial incentives program that is aimed at increasing Botswana's status as a financial centre. Credit is allocated on market terms, although the government provides subsidised loans. Reform of <a href="non-bank%20financial%20institution">non-bank financial institution</a>s has continued in recent years, notably through the establishment of a single financial regulatory agency that provides more effective supervision. The government has abolished exchange controls, and with the resulting creation of new portfolio investment options, the Botswana Stock Exchange is growing.
The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly. Botswana is ranked second only to South Africa among sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2014 International Property Rights Index.

While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves some sectors for citizens. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchise's fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.

Botswana imports refined petroleum products and electricity from South Africa. There is some domestic production of electricity from coal.

In Botswana, the <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070720194637/http%3A//www.mines.gov.bw/">Department of Mines</a> and <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20080209200236/http%3A//www.gov.bw/">Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security</a>, led by Hon Sadique Kebonang in Gaborone, maintains data regarding mining throughout the country.
<a href="Debswana">Debswana</a>, the largest <a href="list%20of%20diamond%20mines">diamond mining</a> company operating in Botswana, is 50% owned by the government. The mineral industry provides about 40% of all government revenues. In 2007, significant quantities of uranium were discovered, and mining was projected to begin by 2010. Several international mining corporations have established regional headquarters in Botswana, and prospected for diamonds, <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, and even <a href="oil">oil</a>, many coming back with positive results. Government announced in early 2009 that they would try to shift their economic dependence on diamonds, over serious concern that diamonds are predicted to dry out in Botswana over the next twenty years.

Botswana's <a href="Orapa%20diamond%20mine">Orapa</a> mine is the largest diamond mine in the world in terms of value and quantity of carats produced annually. Estimated to have produced over 11 million carats in 2013, with an average price of $145/carat, the Orapa mine was estimated to produce over $1.6 billion worth of diamonds in 2013.

The <a href="Tswana%20people">Tswana</a> are the majority ethnic group in Botswana, making up 79% of the population. The largest minority ethnic groups are the <a href="BaKalanga">BaKalanga</a>, and <a href="San%20people">San</a> or <a href="AbaThwa">AbaThwa</a>, also known as Basarwa. Other tribes are <a href="Bayei">Bayei</a>, <a href="Bambukushu">Bambukushu</a>, <a href="Basubia">Basubia</a>, <a href="Baherero">Baherero</a> and <a href="Bakgalagadi">Bakgalagadi</a>. In addition, there are small numbers of whites and Indians, both groups being roughly equally small in number. <a href="Indians%20in%20Botswana">Botswana's Indian</a> population is made up of many Indian-Africans of several generations, with some having migrated from <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and so on, as well as first generation Indian immigrants. The white population speaks <a href="English%20language">English</a> and <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> and makes up roughly 3% of the population.

Since 2000, because of deteriorating economic conditions in Zimbabwe, the number of <a href="Zimbabweans%20in%20Botswana">Zimbabweans in Botswana</a> has risen into the tens of thousands.

Fewer than 10,000 <a href="San%20people">San people</a> are still living their traditional <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> way of life. Since the mid-1990s the central government of Botswana has been trying to move San out of their historic lands. <a href="James%20Anaya">James Anaya</a>, as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people for the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> in 2010, described loss of land as a major contributor to many of the problems facing Botswana's indigenous people, citing the San's eviction from the <a href="Central%20Kalahari%20Game%20Reserve">Central Kalahari Game Reserve</a> (CKGR) as an especial example. Among Anaya's recommendations in a report to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Human%20Rights%20Council">United Nations Human Rights Council</a> was that development programs should promote, in consultation with indigenous communities such as the San and <a href="Bakgalagadi%20people">Bakgalagadi people</a>, activities in harmony with the culture of those communities such as traditional hunting and gathering activities.

The official language of Botswana is English although <a href="Tswana%20language">Setswana</a> is widely spoken across the country. In Setswana, <a href="prefix">prefix</a>es are more important than they are in many other languages, since Setswana is a Bantu language and has noun classes denoted by these prefixes. They include "Bo", which refers to the country, "Ba", which refers to the people, "Mo", which is one person, and "Se" which is the language. For example, the main ethnic group of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.

Other languages spoken in Botswana include <a href="Kalanga%20language">Kalanga</a> (sekalanga), <a href="Tshwa%20language">Sarwa</a> (sesarwa), <a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20language">Ndebele</a>, <a href="Taa%20language">!Xóõ</a> and, in some parts, <a href="Afrikaans%20language">Afrikaans</a>.

An estimated 70% of the country's citizens identify as Christians. Anglicans, Methodists, and the <a href="United%20Congregational%20Church%20of%20Southern%20Africa">United Congregational Church of Southern Africa</a> make up the majority of Christians. There are also congregations of <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>s, Baptists, Roman Catholics, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), the <a href="Dutch%20Reformed%20Church">Dutch Reformed Church</a>, <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>s, Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses in the country. In Gaborone, a Lutheran History Centre is open to the public.

According to the 2001 census, the country has around 5,000 Muslims, mainly from South Asia, 3,000 <a href="Hindus">Hindus</a> and 700 <a href="Baha%27is">Baha'is</a>. Approximately 20% of citizens espouse no religion. Religious services are well attended in both rural and urban areas.

Besides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana—whether construed as members of the Tswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana. In Botswana most of the tribes have different ways that they use to greet one another, but for easy communication and connection batswana use a three way hand shake or one can just greet another by saying "Dumelang" as a way of saying "hello" without having to use hand shakes. In community celebrations like Dikgafela or during marriage ceremonies batswana women show exitement and happiness by the use of ululations as part of their culture.

Botswana music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Botswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument Erhu), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of the many varieties of drums), phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes in a variety of forms). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against phathisi (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the Segaba instrument does not have. It is the outsider that found a home within the culture. The highlight of any celebration or event that shows especially happiness is the dancing. This differs by regime, age, gender and status in the group or if it's a tribal activity, status in the community. The national anthem is <a href="Fatshe%20leno%20la%20rona">Fatshe leno la rona</a>. Written and composed by Kgalemang Tumediso Motsete, it was adopted upon independence in 1966. 

In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of <a href="Etsha">Etsha</a> and <a href="Gumare">Gumare</a> are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from <a href="Mokola%20Palm">Mokola Palm</a> and local <a href="dye">dye</a>s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through colour use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for international markets.

Other notable artistic communities include <a href="Thamaga%20Pottery">Thamaga Pottery</a> and <a href="Oodi%20Weavers">Oodi Weavers</a>, both located in the south-eastern part of Botswana.

The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/Bushmen) over twenty thousand years ago within the <a href="Kalahari">Kalahari</a> desert.

The cuisine of Botswana is unique but also shares some characteristics with other cuisine of Southern Africa. Examples of Botswana food are <a href="Pap%20%28food%29">pap</a> (maize porridge), <a href="boerewors">boerewors</a>, <a href="samp">samp</a>, <a href="vetkoek">vetkoek</a> (fried dough bread) and <a href="Imbrasia%20belina">mopani worms</a>. Foods unique to Botswana include <a href="seswaa">seswaa</a>, heavily <a href="Salted%20meat">salted</a> mashed-up meat.

Botswana is an associate member of the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a>. Botswana became a member of The International Badminton Federation and Africa Badminton Federation in 1991. The <a href="Sport%20in%20Botswana%23Golf">Botswana Golf Union</a> offers an <a href="http%3A//www.botswanagolfunion.org.bw/page2.html">amateur golf league</a> in which golfers compete in tournaments and championships.

Botswana won the country's first Olympic medal in 2012 when runner <a href="Nijel%20Amos">Nijel Amos</a> won silver in the <a href="Athletics%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20800%20metres">800 metres</a>. In 2011, <a href="Amantle%20Montsho">Amantle Montsho</a> became <a href="2011%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20400%20metres">world champion</a> in the 400 metres and won Botswana's first athletics medal on the world level. High jumper <a href="Kabelo%20Kgosiemang">Kabelo Kgosiemang</a> is a three time <a href="African%20Championships%20in%20Athletics">African champion</a>.

The card game <a href="Contract%20bridge">bridge</a> has a strong following; it was first played in Botswana over 30 years ago, and it grew in popularity during the 1980s. Many British expatriate school teachers informally taught the game in Botswana's secondary schools. The Botswana Bridge Federation (BBF) was founded in 1988 and continues to organise tournaments. Bridge has remained popular and the BBF has over 800 members. In 2007, the BBF invited the <a href="English%20Bridge%20Union">English Bridge Union</a> to host a week-long teaching program in May 2008.

Botswana has made great strides in educational development since independence in 1966. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and only a very small percentage of the population attended secondary school. Botswana increased its adult literacy rate from 69% in 1991 to 83% in 2008.

With the discovery of diamonds and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the <a href="Botswana%20General%20Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education">Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Education</a> (BGCSE). Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.

After leaving school, students can attend one of the seven technical colleges in the country, or take vocational training courses in <a href="teaching">teaching</a> or <a href="nursing">nursing</a>. Students enter the <a href="University%20of%20Botswana">University of Botswana</a>, <a href="Botswana%20College%20of%20Agriculture">Botswana College of Agriculture</a>, <a href="Botswana%20International%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology">Botswana International University of Science and Technology</a> and the <a href="Botswana%20Accountancy%20College">Botswana Accountancy College</a> in Gaborone. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. Notable amongst these is <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130904150159/http%3A//www.bothocollege.ac.bw/">Botho University</a>, the country's first private university which offers undergraduate programmes in Accounting, Business and Computing. Another international university is the <a href="Limkokwing%20University%20of%20Creative%20Technology">Limkokwing University of Creative Technology</a> which offers various associate degrees in Creative Arts. Other tertiary institutions include <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130812002117/http%3A//www.baisago.co.bw/">Ba Isago</a>, ABM University College the largest school of business and management, <a href="http%3A//www.neweracollege.ac.bw/">New Era</a>, <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120328065146/http%3A//www.gips.ac.bw/gips.php">Gaborone Institute of Professional Studies</a> etc. Tremendous strides in providing quality education have been made by private education providers such that a large number of the best students in the country are now applying to them as well. A vast majority of these students are government sponsored. The nation's second international university, the <a href="Botswana%20International%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology">Botswana International University of Science and Technology</a>, was completed in <a href="Palapye">Palapye</a> in 2011.

The quantitative gains have not always been matched by qualitative ones. Primary schools in particular still lack resources, and the teachers are less well paid than their secondary school colleagues. The <a href="Botswana%20Ministry%20of%20Education">Botswana Ministry of Education</a> is working to establish libraries in primary schools in partnership with the <a href="African%20Library%20Project">African Library Project</a>. The <a href="Government%20of%20Botswana">Government of Botswana</a> hopes that by investing a large part of national income in education, the country will become less dependent on diamonds for its economic survival, and less dependent on expatriates for its skilled workers. Those objectives are in part pursued through policies in favour of vocational education, gathered within the NPVET (National Policy on Vocational Education and Training), aiming to "integrate the different types of vocational education and training into one comprehensive system". Botswana invests 21% of its government spending in education.

In January 2006, Botswana announced the reintroduction of school fees after two decades of free state education though the government still provides full scholarships with living expenses to any Botswana citizen in university, either at the University of Botswana or if the student wishes to pursue an education in any field not offered locally, such as medicine, they are provided with a full scholarship to study abroad.

Botswana is planning to use <a href="Science%20and%20technology%20in%20Botswana">science and technology</a> to diversify its economy and thereby reduce its dependence on diamond mining. To this end, the government has set up six hubs since 2008, in the agriculture, diamonds, innovation, transport, health and education sectors.

Botswana published its updated "National Policy on Research, Science and Technology" in 2011, within a UNESCO project sponsored by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development (AECID). This policy aims to take up the challenges of rapid technological evolution, globalization and the achievement of the national development goals formulated in high-level strategic documents that include Botswana's "Tenth National Development Plan" to 2016 and "Vision 2016".

The "National Policy on Research, Science, Technology and Innovation" (2011) fixes the target of raising gross domestic expenditure on research and development (R&D) from 0.26% of GDP in 2012 to over 2% of GDP by 2016. This target can only be reached within the specified time frame by raising public spending on R&D.

Despite the modest level of financial investment in research, Botswana counts one of the highest researcher densities in sub-Saharan Africa: 344 per million inhabitants (in head counts), compared to an average of 91 per million inhabitants for the subcontinent in 2013.

The <a href="http%3A//www.moh.gov.bw/">Ministry of Health</a> in Botswana is responsible for overseeing the quality and distribution of <a href="healthcare">healthcare</a> throughout the country. <a href="Life%20expectancy">Life expectancy</a> at birth was 55 in 2009 according to the World Bank, having previously fallen from a peak of 64.1 in 1990 to a low of 49 in 2002. After Botswana's 2011 census, current life expectancy is estimated at 54.06 years.

The <a href="Cancer%20Association%20of%20Botswana">Cancer Association of Botswana</a> is a voluntary non-governmental organisation. The association is a member of the Union for International Cancer Control. The Association supplements existing services through provision of cancer prevention and health awareness programmes, facilitating access to health services for cancer patients and offering support and counseling to those affected.

Like elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, the <a href="economic%20impact%20of%20AIDS">economic impact of AIDS</a> is considerable. Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 2002–3 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20Botswana">Botswana has been hit</a> very hard by the <a href="AIDS%20pandemic">AIDS pandemic</a>; in 2006 it was estimated that life expectancy at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years. However, after Botswana's 2011 census current life expectancy is estimated at 54.06 years.

The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Botswana was estimated at 25.4% for adults aged 15–49 in 2009 and 21.9% in 2013, exceeded by Lesotho and Swaziland in sub-Saharan African nations. This places Botswana at the third highest prevalence in the world, in 2013, while "leading the way in prevention and treatment programmes". In 2003, the government began a comprehensive program involving free or cheap generic <a href="Antiretroviral%20drug">antiretroviral</a> drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus; in 2013, over 40% of adults in Botswana had access to antiretroviral therapy. In the age group of 15–19 years old, prevalence was estimated at about 6% for females and 3.5% for males in 2013, and for the 20–24 age group, 15% for females and 5% for males Botswana is one of 21 priority countries identified by the UN AIDS group in 2011 in the Global Plan to eliminate new HIV infections among children and to keep their mothers alive. From 2009 to 2013, the country saw a decrease over 50% in new HIV infections in children. A further measure of the success, or reason for hope, in dealing with HIV in Botswana, is that less than 10% of pregnant HIV-infected women were not receiving antiretroviral medications in 2013, with a corresponding large decrease (over 50%) in the number of new HIV infections in children under 5. Among the UN Global Plan countries, people living with HIV in Botswana have the highest percentage receiving antiretroviral treatment: about 75% for adults (age 15+) and about 98% for children.

With a nationwide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program, Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% to just 4%. Under the leadership of <a href="Festus%20Mogae">Festus Mogae</a>, the Government of Botswana solicited outside help in fighting HIV/AIDS and received early support from the <a href="Bill%20and%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, the Merck Foundation, and together formed the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership (ACHAP). Other early partners include the <a href="Botswana-Harvard%20AIDS%20Institute">Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute</a>, of the <a href="Harvard%20School%20of%20Public%20Health">Harvard School of Public Health</a> and the <a href="Botswana-UPenn%20Partnership">Botswana-UPenn Partnership</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, universal access to treatment – defined as 80% coverage or greater – has been achieved in Botswana.

Potential reasons for Botswana's high HIV prevalence include concurrent sexual partnerships, transactional sex, cross-generational sex, and a significant number of people who travel outside of their local communities in pursuit of work. The <a href="polyamory">polyamorous</a> nature of many sexual relationships further impacts the health situation, to the extent that it has given rise to a love vocabulary that is unique to the region.

The Botswana Tourism Organisation is the country's official tourism group. Primarily, tourists visit Gaborone due to the city having numerous activities for visitors. The Lion Park Resort is Botswana's first permanent <a href="amusement%20park">amusement park</a> and hosts events such as <a href="Birthday%20party%23Birthday%20party">birthday parties</a> for families. Other destinations in Botswana include the Gaborone Yacht Club and the Kalahari Fishing Club and natural attractions such as the Gaborone Dam and Mokolodi Nature Reserve. There are <a href="golf%20course">golf course</a>s which are maintained by the Botswana Golf Union (BGU). The Phakalane Golf Estate is a multimillion-dollar clubhouse that offers both hotel accommodations and access to golf courses.

Brunei

Brunei (, ), officially the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace (, <a href="Jawi%20alphabet">Jawi</a>: ), is a <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign state</a> located on the north coast of the island of <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Apart from its coastline with the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>, the country is completely surrounded by the <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>n <a href="federated%20state">state</a> of <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a>. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of <a href="Limbang%20District">Limbang</a>. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. <a href="Demographics%20of%20Brunei">Brunei's population</a> was in .

At the peak of the <a href="Bruneian%20Empire">Bruneian Empire</a>, <a href="Bolkiah">Sultan Bolkiah</a> (reigned 1485–1528) is alleged to have had control over most regions of Borneo, including modern-day Sarawak and <a href="Sabah">Sabah</a>, as well as the <a href="Sulu%20Archipelago">Sulu Archipelago</a> off the northeast tip of Borneo, <a href="Seludong">Seludong</a> (modern-day <a href="Manila">Manila</a>), and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The <a href="thalassocracy">maritime state</a> was visited by Spain's <a href="Timeline%20of%20Magellan%27s%20circumnavigation">Magellan Expedition</a> in 1521 and fought against Spain in the 1578 <a href="Castilian%20War">Castilian War</a>.

During the 19th century, the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The Sultanate ceded Sarawak (<a href="Kuching">Kuching</a>) to <a href="James%20Brooke">James Brooke</a> and installed him as the <a href="White%20Rajahs">White Rajah</a>, and it ceded Sabah to the British <a href="North%20Borneo%20Chartered%20Company">North Borneo Chartered Company</a>. In 1888, Brunei became a British <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> and was assigned a <a href="Resident%20%28title%29">British resident</a> as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, in 1959 a new constitution was written. In 1962, a small <a href="Brunei%20revolt">armed rebellion</a> against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British.

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. It has developed wealth from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields. Brunei has the second-highest <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a> among the <a href="Southeast%20Asian">Southeast Asian</a> nations, after Singapore, and is classified as a "<a href="developed%20country">developed country</a>". According to the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a>. The IMF estimated in 2011 that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being <a href="Libya">Libya</a>) with a public debt at 0% of the national GDP. "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" also ranks Brunei as the fifth-richest nation out of 182, based on its petroleum and natural gas fields.

According to legend, Brunei was founded by Awang Alak Betatar, later to be <a href="Muhammad%20Shah%20of%20Brunei">Sultan Muhammad Shah</a>. He moved from Garang in the <a href="Temburong">Temburong</a> District to the <a href="Brunei%20River">Brunei River</a> estuary, discovering Brunei. According to legend, upon landing he exclaimed, "Baru nah" (loosely translated as "that's it!" or "there"), from which the name "Brunei" was derived. He was the first Muslim ruler of Brunei. Before the rise of the <a href="Bruneian%20Empire">Bruneian Empire</a> under the Muslim Bolkiah Dynasty, Brunei is believed to have been under Buddhist rulers.

It was renamed "Barunai" in the 14th century, possibly influenced by the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word "'" (), meaning "seafarers". The word "<a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>" is of the same origin. In the country's full name, ', ' () means "abode of peace", while ' means "country" in <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>.

The earliest recorded documentation by the West about Brunei is by an Italian known as <a href="Ludovico%20di%20Varthema">Ludovico di Varthema</a>, who also said the "Bruneian people have fairer skin tone than the peoples he met in <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Maluku Islands</a>". On his documentation back to 1550;

We arrived at the island of Bornei" (Brunei or Borneo), "which is distant from the "Maluch" about two hundred miles, and we found that it was somewhat larger than the aforesaid and much lower. The people are pagans and are men of goodwill. Their colour is whiter than that of the other sort...in this island justice is well administered...

One of the earliest Chinese records is the 977 AD letter to Chinese emperor from the ruler of Po-ni, which some scholars believe to refer to Borneo. In 1225, a Chinese official, Chau Ju-Kua (<a href="Zhao%20Rugua">Zhao Rugua</a>), reported that Po-ni had 100 warships to protect its trade, and that there was a lot of wealth in the kingdom.

In the fourteenth century, the <a href="Java">Java</a>nese manuscript <a href="Nagarakretagama">Nagarakretagama</a>, written by <a href="Mpu%20Prapanca">Prapanca</a> in 1365, mentioned "Barune" as the <a href="vassal%20state">vassal state</a> of <a href="Majapahit">Majapahit</a>, which had to make an annual <a href="tribute">tribute</a> of 40 <a href="catty">katis</a> of <a href="camphor">camphor</a>. In 1369, the Sulus attacked Po-ni, looting it of treasure and gold. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Po-ni was left weaker after the attack. A Chinese report from 1371 described Po-ni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.

However, scholars claim that the power of the <a href="Sultanate">Sultanate</a> of Brunei was at <a href="Bruneian%20Empire">its peak</a> between the 15th and 17th centuries, with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines. By the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei, and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltrán, a Spanish traveller, described it as being five stories tall and built on the water.

<a href="Colonialism">European influence</a> gradually brought an end to the <a href="regional%20power">regional power</a>, as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. Since the Spanish regarded Brunei the center of Islamic preaching in the Philippines Spain <a href="Castille%20War">declared war</a> in 1578, planning to attack and capture <a href="Kota%20Batu%2C%20Brunei-Muara">Kota Batu</a>, Brunei's capital at the time. This was based in part on the assistance of two Bruneian <a href="Pengiran%23Brunei">noblemen</a>, Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, then the centre of the Spanish colony, Manila itself was captured from Brunei and Christianized, Pengiran Seri Lela came to offer Brunei as a <a href="tributary%20state">tributary</a> to Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal. The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new <a href="Bendahara">Bendahara</a>.

In March 1578, the Spanish fleet had arrived from Mexico and settled at the Philippines, they were led by <a href="Francisco%20de%20Sande">De Sande</a>, acting as <a href="Capit%C3%A1n-General">Capitán-General</a>, he organized an expedition from Manila for Brunei. The expedition consisted of 400 Spanish, 1,500 <a href="Filipino%20people">Filipino</a> natives and 300 Borneans. The campaign was one of many, which also included action in <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> and <a href="Sulu%20Archipelago">Sulu</a>.

The Spanish invaded the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to <a href="Jerudong">Jerudong</a>. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. Suffering high fatalities due to a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> or <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> outbreak, the Spanish decided to abandon Brunei and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days. Before doing so, they burned the mosque, a high structure with a five-tier roof.

Pengiran Seri Lela died in August or September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his Spanish allies. There was suspicion he could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan. Seri Lela's daughter, a Bruneian princess had left with the Spanish, she married a Christian <a href="Tagalog%20people">Tagalog</a>, named Agustín de Legazpi de Tondo.

The local Brunei accounts differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by Bendahara Sakam, purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a <a href="folk-hero">folk-hero</a> account, which probably developed decades or centuries after. The country suffered a <a href="Brunei%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> from 1660 to 1673.

The British have intervened in the affairs of Brunei on several occasions. Britain attacked Brunei in July 1846 due to internal conflicts over who was the rightful Sultan.

In the 1880s, the decline of the <a href="Bruneian%20Empire">Bruneian Empire</a> continued. The sultan granted land (now Sarawak) to <a href="James%20Brooke">James Brooke</a>, who had helped him quell a rebellion and allowed him to establish the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sarawak">Kingdom of Sarawak</a>. Over time, Brooke and his nephews (who succeeded him) leased or annexed more land. Brunei lost much of its territory to him and his dynasty, known as the <a href="White%20Rajahs">White Rajahs</a>.

Sultan <a href="Hashim%20Jalilul%20Alam%20Aqamaddin">Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin</a> appealed to the British to stop further encroachment by the Brookes. The "Treaty of Protection" was negotiated by <a href="Sir%20Hugh%20Low">Sir Hugh Low</a> and signed into effect on 17 September 1888. The treaty said that the sultan "could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without British consent"; it provided <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a> effective control over Brunei's external affairs, making it a British <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> (which continued until 1984). But, when the Kingdom of Sarawak annexed Brunei's <a href="Limbang%20Division">Pandaruan District</a> in 1890, the British did not take any action to stop it. They did not regard either Brunei or the Kingdom of Sarawak as 'foreign' (per the Treaty of Protection). This final annexation by Sarawak left Brunei with its current small land mass and separation into two parts.

<a href="British%20resident">British resident</a>s were introduced in Brunei under the Supplementary Protectorate Agreement in 1906. The residents were to advise the sultan on all matters of administration. Over time, the resident assumed more executive control than the sultan. The residential system ended in 1959.

Petroleum was discovered in 1929 after several fruitless attempts. Two men, F.F. Marriot and T.G. Cochrane, smelled oil near the <a href="Seria">Seria</a> river in late 1926. They informed a <a href="geophysicist">geophysicist</a>, who conducted a survey there. In 1927, gas seepages were reported in the area. Seria Well Number One (S-1) was drilled on 12 July 1928. Oil was struck at on 5 April 1929. Seria Well Number 2 was drilled on 19 August 1929, and, , continues to produce oil. Oil production was increased considerably in the 1930s with the development of more oil fields. In 1940, oil production was at more than six million barrels. The British Malayan Petroleum Company (now <a href="Brunei%20Shell%20Petroleum">Brunei Shell Petroleum</a> Company) was formed on 22 July 1922. The first offshore well was drilled in 1957. Oil and natural gas have been the basis of Brunei's development and wealth since the late 20th century.

The Japanese invaded Brunei on 16 December 1941, eight days after their <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> and the United States Navy. They landed 10,000 troops of the <a href="Kawaguchi%20Detachment">Kawaguchi Detachment</a> from <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Bay">Cam Ranh Bay</a> at <a href="Kuala%20Belait">Kuala Belait</a>. After six days fighting, they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the <a href="15th%20Punjab%20Regiment">15th Punjab Regiment</a> based at <a href="Kuching">Kuching</a>, Sarawak.

Once the Japanese occupied Brunei, they made an agreement with <a href="Ahmad%20Tajuddin">Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin</a> over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the British Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed <a href="Chief%20Administrative%20Officer">Chief Administrative Officer</a> under the Japanese Governor. The Japanese had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration, but he declined. Both he and other British nationals still in Brunei were interned by the Japanese at <a href="Batu%20Lintang%20camp">Batu Lintang camp</a> in Sarawak. While the British officials were under Japanese guard, Ibrahim made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing him well.

The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the Japanese. During the later part of the occupation, he resided at Tantuya, <a href="Limbang">Limbang</a> and had little to do with the Japanese. Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the Japanese. Brunei's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included British <a href="North%20Borneo">North Borneo</a>. The Prefectures included <a href="Miri%20Division">Baram</a>, <a href="Labuan">Labuan</a>, <a href="Lawas">Lawas</a>, and <a href="Limbang">Limbang</a>. Ibrahim hid numerous significant government documents from the Japanese during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran <a href="Haji%20Mohd%20Yusuf">Haji Mohd Yusuf</a>), along with other Bruneians, was sent to Japan for training. Although in the area the day of the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a>, Yusuf survived.
The British had anticipated a Japanese attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of their engagement in the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the <a href="Seria">Seria</a> oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the Japanese their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Malaya">Japanese invaded Malaya</a>. By the end of the war, 16 wells at <a href="Miri%2C%20Malaysia">Miri</a> and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at <a href="Muara%2C%20Brunei">Muara</a> was also recommenced, but with little success.
During the occupation, the Japanese had their language taught in schools, and Government officers were required to learn Japanese. The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as <a href="Banana%20money">"duit pisang" (banana money)</a>. From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and, at the end of the war, this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease. Food and medicine fell into short supply, and the population suffered famine and disease.

The <a href="Brunei%20International%20Airport">airport</a> runway was constructed by the Japanese during the occupation, and in 1943 Japanese naval units were based in <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a> and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, but the airport runway survived. The facility was developed as a public airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying Japanese, which destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed <a href="Kampong%20Ayer">Kampong Ayer</a>.

On 10 June 1945, the <a href="Australian%209th%20Division">Australian 9th Division</a> landed at Muara under <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Borneo">Operation Oboe Six</a> to recapture Borneo from the Japanese. They were supported by American air and naval units. Brunei town was bombed extensively and recaptured after three days of heavy fighting. Many buildings were destroyed, including the Mosque. The Japanese forces in Brunei, Borneo, and Sarawak, under Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, formally surrendered at Labuan on 10 September 1945. The British Military Administration took over from the Japanese and remained until July 1946.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, a new government was formed in Brunei under the <a href="British%20Military%20Administration%20%28Borneo%29">British Military Administration</a> (BMA). It consisted mainly of Australian officers and servicemen. The administration of Brunei was passed to the Civil Administration on 6 July 1945. The Brunei State Council was also revived that year. The BMA was tasked to revive the Bruneian economy, which was extensively damaged by the Japanese during their occupation. They also had to put out the fires on the wells of Seria, which had been set by the Japanese prior to their defeat.

Before 1941, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, based in Singapore, was responsible for the duties of British High Commissioner for Brunei, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sarawak">Sarawak</a>, and <a href="North%20Borneo">North Borneo</a> (now <a href="Sabah">Sabah</a>). The first <a href="British%20High%20Commissioner">British High Commissioner</a> for Brunei was the Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Ardon Clarke.
The Barisan Pemuda ("Youth Movement") (abbreviated as BARIP) was the first political party to be formed in Brunei, on 12 April 1946. The party intended to "preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the <a href="Ethnic%20Malays">Malays</a>". BARIP also contributed to the composition of the country's national anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity.

In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defence remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom. A small <a href="rebellion">rebellion</a> erupted against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help of the UK. Known as the <a href="Brunei%20Revolt">Brunei Revolt</a>, it contributed to the failure to create the <a href="North%20Borneo%20Federation">North Borneo Federation</a>. The rebellion partially affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the Malaysian Federation.

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. The official National Day, which celebrates the country's independence, is held by tradition on 23 February.

In July 1953, Sultan <a href="Omar%20Ali%20Saifuddien%20III">Omar Ali Saifuddien III</a> formed a seven-member committee named "Tujuh Serangkai", to find out the citizens' views regarding a written constitution for Brunei. In May 1954, the Sultan, Resident and High Commissioner met to discuss the findings of the committee. They agreed to authorise the drafting of a constitution. In March 1959 Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution. The British delegation was led by Sir <a href="Alan%20Lennox-Boyd">Alan Lennox-Boyd</a>, Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Government later accepted the draft constitution.

On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in <a href="Bandar%20Seri%20Begawan">Bandar Seri Begawan</a>. The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia.
It included the following provisions:

Five councils were set up:

A series of National Development Plans was initiated by the 28th Sultan of Brunei, <a href="Omar%20Ali%20Saifuddien%20III">Omar Ali Saifuddien III</a>.

The first was introduced in 1953. A total sum of B$100 million was approved by the Brunei State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington, from the Colonial Office in <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, was appointed to implement it. A $US14 million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the Brunei Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 <a href="barrels%20per%20day">bpd</a>.

The plan also aided the development of public education. By 1958, expenditure on education totalled at $4 million. Communications were improved, as new roads were built and reconstruction at Berakas Airport was completed in 1954.

The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962. A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963, with this discovery, <a href="Liquefied%20Natural%20Gas">Liquefied Natural Gas</a> became important. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued, and oil production has steadily increased since then. The plan also promoted the production of meat and eggs for consumption by citizens. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The <a href="List%20of%20Panamax%20ports">deepwater port</a> at <a href="Muara%2C%20Brunei">Muara</a> was also constructed during this period. Power requirements were met, and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas. Efforts were made to eradicate <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, an endemic disease in the region, with the help of the <a href="World%20Health%20Organisation">World Health Organisation</a>. Malaria cases were reduced from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959. The death rate was reduced from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953. Infectious disease has been prevented by public sanitation and improvement of drainage, and the provision of piped pure water to the population.

On 14 November 1971, Sultan <a href="Hassanal%20Bolkiah">Hassanal Bolkiah</a> left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the British representative being <a href="Anthony%20Royle%2C%20Baron%20Fanshawe%20of%20Richmond">Anthony Royle</a>.

Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon:

This agreement also caused <a href="British%20Military%20Garrison%20Brunei">Gurkha units</a> to be deployed in Brunei, where they remain up to this day.

On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between Brunei and the UK. It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted Brunei to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist Brunei in diplomatic matters. In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of Brunei would be 1 January 1984.

On 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country and at midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan subsequently assumed the title "<a href="His%20Majesty">His Majesty</a>", rather than the previous "<a href="His%20Royal%20Highness">His Royal Highness</a>". Brunei was <a href="Member%20states%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">admitted to the United Nations</a> on 22 September 1984, becoming the organisation's 159th member.

In October 2013, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced his intention to impose Sharia law on the country's Muslims, which take up roughly two thirds of the country's population. This would be implemented in three phases, culminating in 2016, and making Brunei the first and only country in East Asia to introduce Sharia law into its penal code. The move attracted international criticism, the United Nations expressing "deep concern".

Brunei is a southeast Asian country consisting of two unconnected parts with a total area of on the island of Borneo. It has of coastline next to the <a href="South%20China%20sea">South China sea</a>, and it shares a 381 km (237 mi) border with Malaysia. It has of territorial waters, and a <a href="exclusive%20economic%20zone">exclusive economic zone</a>.

About 97% of the population lives in the larger western part (<a href="Belait%20District">Belait</a>, <a href="Tutong%20District">Tutong</a>, and <a href="Brunei%20and%20Muara">Brunei-Muara</a>), while only about 10,000 people live in the mountainous eastern part (<a href="Temburong%20District">Temburong District</a>). The total population of Brunei is approximately 408,000 , of which around 150,000 live in the capital <a href="Bandar%20Seri%20Begawan">Bandar Seri Begawan</a>. Other major towns are the port town of <a href="Muara%2C%20Brunei">Muara</a>, the oil-producing town of <a href="Seria">Seria</a> and its neighbouring town, <a href="Kuala%20Belait">Kuala Belait</a>. In Belait District, the <a href="Panaga">Panaga</a> area is home to large numbers of Europeans expatriates, due to <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a> and British Army housing, and several recreational facilities are located there.

Most of Brunei is within the <a href="Borneo%20lowland%20rain%20forests">Borneo lowland rain forests</a> ecoregion, which covers most of the island. Areas of <a href="Borneo%20montane%20rain%20forests">mountain rain forests</a> inland.

The <a href="climate%20of%20Brunei">climate of Brunei</a> is <a href="tropical%20climate">tropical</a> <a href="Tropical%20rainforest%20climate">equatorial</a>.

Brunei's political system is governed by the constitution and the national tradition of the Malay Islamic Monarchy, the concept of "<a href="Melayu%20Islam%20Beraja">Melayu Islam Beraja</a>" (MIB). The three components of MIB cover Malay culture, Islamic religion, and the political framework under the monarchy. It has a legal system based on <a href="English%20common%20law">English common law</a>, although Islamic <a href="shariah%20law">shariah law</a> supersedes this in some cases. Brunei <a href="Legislative%20Council%20of%20Brunei">has a parliament</a> but there are no elections; the last election was held in <a href="Brunei%20Revolt">1962</a>.

Under Brunei's 1959 constitution, <a href="His%20Majesty%20Paduka%20Seri%20Baginda%20Sultan%20Haji%20Hassanal%20Bolkiah%20Mu%27izzaddin%20Waddaulah">His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> with full executive authority. Since <a href="Brunei%20Revolt">1962</a>, this authority has included emergency powers, which are renewed every two years. Brunei has technically been under <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> since the <a href="Brunei%20Revolt">Brunei Revolt</a> of 1962. <a href="Hassanal%20Bolkiah">Hassanal Bolkiah</a> also serves as the state's Prime Minister, <a href="Finance%20Minister">Finance Minister</a> and <a href="Defence%20Minister">Defence Minister</a>. The Royal family retains a venerated status within Brunei.

Until 1979, Brunei's foreign relations were managed by the UK government. After that, they were handled by the Brunei Diplomatic Service. After independence in 1984, this Service was upgraded to ministerial level and is now known as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Officially, Brunei's foreign policy is as follows:

With its traditional ties with the United Kingdom, Brunei became the 49th member of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> immediately on the day of its independence on 1 January 1984. As one of its first initiatives toward improved regional relations, Brunei joined <a href="ASEAN">ASEAN</a> on 7 January 1984, becoming the sixth member. To achieve recognition of its sovereignty and independence, it joined the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> as a full member on 21 September of that same year.

As an Islamic country, Brunei became a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the <a href="Organisation%20of%20Islamic%20Cooperation">Organisation of Islamic Cooperation</a>) in January 1984 at the Fourth Islamic Summit held in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>.

After its accession to the <a href="Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</a> forum (APEC) in 1989, Brunei hosted the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November 2000 and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in July 2002. Brunei became a founding member of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) on 1 January 1995, and is a major player in <a href="BIMP-EAGA">BIMP-EAGA</a>, which was formed during the Inaugural Ministers' Meeting in <a href="Davao%20City">Davao</a>, <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> on 24 March 1994.

Brunei shares a close relationship with <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> and the Philippines. In April 2009, Brunei and the Philippines signed a <a href="Memorandum%20of%20Understanding">Memorandum of Understanding</a> (MOU) that seeks to strengthen the bilateral co-operation of the two countries in the fields of agriculture and farm-related trade and investments.

Brunei is one of many nations to lay claim to some of the disputed <a href="Spratly%20Islands">Spratly Islands</a>. The status of <a href="Limbang">Limbang</a> as part of Sarawak has been disputed by Brunei since the area was first annexed in 1890. The issue was reportedly settled in 2009, with Brunei agreeing to accept the border in exchange for Malaysia giving up claims to oil fields in Bruneian waters. The Brunei government denies this and says that their claim on Limbang was never dropped.

Brunei was the chair for <a href="ASEAN">ASEAN</a> in 2013. It also hosted the ASEAN summit on that same year.

Brunei maintains three infantry battalions stationed around the country. The Brunei navy has several "Ijtihad"-class patrol boats purchased from a German manufacturer. The United Kingdom also maintains a base in <a href="Seria">Seria</a>, the centre of the oil industry in Brunei. A Gurkha battalion consisting of 1,500 personnel is stationed there. United Kingdom military personnel are stationed there under a defence agreement signed between the two countries.

A <a href="Bell%20212">Bell 212</a> operated by the air force crashed in <a href="Kuala%20Belait">Kuala Belait</a> on 20 July 2012 with the loss of 12 of the 14 crew on board. The cause of the accident has yet to be ascertained. The crash is the worst aviation incident in the history of Brunei.

The Army is currently acquiring new equipment, including <a href="UAV">UAV</a>s and <a href="Sikorsky%20S-70">S-70i Black Hawks</a>.

Brunei's Legislative Council proposed an increase of the defence budget for the 2016–17 fiscal year of about five per cent to 564 million Brunei dollars ($408 million). This amounts to about ten per cent of the state's total national yearly expenditure and represents around 2.5 per cent of GDP.

Brunei is divided into four districts ("<a href="daerah">daerah</a>s") and 38 subdistricts ("<a href="mukim">mukim</a>s").

The daerah of Temburong is physically separated from the rest of Brunei by the <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>n state of <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a>.

The daerah of Brunei-Maura includes Brunei's capital city, <a href="Bandar%20Seri%20Begawan">Bandar Seri Begawan</a>, whose suburbs dominate fifteen of the eighteen mukims in this daerah.

Over 90% of Brunei's total population lives in 15 of the 38 mukims:

Brunei's small, wealthy <a href="economic%20system">economy</a> is a mixture of <a href="foreign%20corporation">foreign</a> and <a href="domestic%20policy">domestic</a> entrepreneurship, government regulation, <a href="social%20welfare">welfare</a> measures, and village tradition. <a href="petroleum">Crude oil</a> and natural gas production account for about 90% of its GDP. About of oil are produced every day, making Brunei the fourth-largest producer of oil in Southeast Asia. It also produces approximately of <a href="liquified%20natural%20gas">liquified natural gas</a> per day, making Brunei the ninth-largest exporter of the substance in the world.

Substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. Most of these investments are made by the Brunei Investment Agency, an arm of the Ministry of Finance. The government provides for all medical services, and subsidises rice and housing.

The national <a href="flag%20carrier">air carrier</a>, <a href="Royal%20Brunei%20Airlines">Royal Brunei Airlines</a>, is trying to develop Brunei as a modest hub for international travel between Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Central to this strategy is the position that the airline maintains at London Heathrow Airport. It holds a daily slot at the highly capacity-controlled airport, which it serves from Bandar Seri Begawan via Dubai. The airline also has services to major Asian destinations including Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore and Manila.

Brunei depends heavily on imports such as agricultural products (e.g. rice, <a href="convenience%20food">food products</a>, livestock, etc.), <a href="automobile">motorcars</a> and <a href="consumer%20electronics">electrical products</a> from other countries. Brunei imports 60% of its food requirements; of that amount, around 75% come from the ASEAN countries.

Brunei's leaders are very concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal <a href="social%20cohesion">social cohesion</a>. But, it has become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 <a href="Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</a> (APEC) forum. Leaders plan to upgrade the <a href="labour%20%28economics%29">labour</a> force, reduce unemployment, which was at 6.9% in 2014; strengthen the banking and tourism sectors, and, in general, broaden the economic base.

The government of Brunei has also promoted food self-sufficiency, especially in <a href="rice">rice</a>. Brunei renamed its Brunei Darussalam Rice 1 as Laila Rice during the launch of the "Padi Planting Towards Achieving Self-Sufficiency of Rice Production in Brunei Darussalam" ceremony at the Wasan padi fields in April 2009. In August 2009, the Royal Family reaped the first few Laila padi stalks, after years of attempts to boost local rice production, a goal first articulated about half a century ago. In July 2009 Brunei launched its national <a href="halal">halal</a> branding scheme, Brunei Halal, with a goal to export to foreign markets.

The population centres in the country are linked by a network of of road. The highway from Muara Town to Kuala Belait is being upgraded to a <a href="dual%20carriageway">dual carriageway</a>.

Brunei is accessible by air, sea, and land transport. <a href="Brunei%20International%20Airport">Brunei International Airport</a> is the main entry point to the country. <a href="Royal%20Brunei%20Airlines">Royal Brunei Airlines</a> is the national carrier. There is another airfield, the <a href="Anduki%20Airfield">Anduki Airfield</a>, located in <a href="Seria">Seria</a>. The ferry terminal at Muara services regular connections to <a href="Labuan">Labuan</a> (Malaysia). Speedboats provide passenger and goods transportation to the Temburong district. The main highway running across Brunei is the Tutong-Muara Highway. The country's road network is well developed. Brunei has one main sea port located at Muara.

The airport in Brunei is currently being extensively upgraded. Changi Airport International is the consultant working on this modernisation, which planned cost is currently $150 million. This project is slated to add of new floorspace and includes a new terminal and arrival hall. With the completion of this project, the annual passenger capacity of the airport is expected to double from 1.5 to 3 million.

With one private car for every 2.09 persons, Brunei has one of the highest car ownership rates in the world. This has been attributed to the absence of a comprehensive transport system, low import tax, and low unleaded petrol price of B$0.53 per litre.

A new roadway <a href="Temburong%20Bridge">connecting the Muara and Temburong</a> districts of Brunei is slated to be completed in 2019. Fourteen kilometres (9 mi) of this roadway would be crossing the <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a>. The bridge cost is $1.6 billions.

<a href="Bank%20of%20China">Bank of China</a> has just (April 2016) received permission to open a branch in Brunei. <a href="Citibank">Citibank</a>, which entered in 1972, closed its operations in Brunei in 2014. <a href="HSBC">HSBC</a>, which had entered in 1947, is currently in the process of closing its operations in the country.

Ethnicities indigenous to Brunei include the <a href="Belait%20people">Belait</a>, <a href="Brunei%20Bisaya%20language">Brunei Bisaya</a> (not to be confused with the Bisaya/Visaya of the nearby Philippines), indigenous <a href="Bruneian%20Malay%20people">Bruneian Malay</a>, <a href="Dusun%20people">Dusun</a>, <a href="Kedayan">Kedayan</a>, <a href="Lun%20Bawang">Lun Bawang</a>, <a href="Murut%20people">Murut</a> and <a href="Tutong%20language">Tutong</a>.

Two-thirds of the population, including the majority of <a href="Bruneian%20Malay%20people">Bruneian Malays</a> and <a href="Ethnic%20Chinese%20in%20Brunei">Bruneian Chinese</a>, adhere to Islam. Other faiths practised are <a href="Buddhism%20in%20Brunei">Buddhism</a> (13%, mainly by the Chinese) and <a href="Christianity%20in%20Brunei">Christianity</a> (10%). <a href="Freethought">Freethinkers</a>, mostly Chinese, form about 7% of the population. Although most of them practise some form of religion with elements of Buddhism, <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, and <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a>, they prefer to present themselves as having practised no religion officially, hence labelled as <a href="atheism">atheists</a> in official censuses.

Therefore, Arabic is taught in schools, particularly religious schools, and also in institutes of higher learning. As of 2004, there are six Arabic schools and one religious teachers' college in Brunei. A majority of Brunei's Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic language</a> as part of their religious education.

The culture of Brunei is predominantly <a href="Malay%20people">Malay</a> (reflecting its ethnicity), with heavy influences from <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, but is seen as much more conservative than <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. Influences to Bruneian culture come from the Malay cultures of the <a href="Malay%20Archipelago">Malay Archipelago</a>. Four periods of cultural influence have occurred, animist, <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>, Islamic, and Western. Islam had a very strong influence, and was adopted as Brunei's ideology and philosophy. Brunei's official main language is <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> but English is also widely spoken as it is a compulsory subject in the majority of the schools.

Media in Brunei are said to be "pro-government". The country has been given "Not Free" status by <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a>; press criticism of the government and monarchy is rare. Nonetheless, the press is not overtly hostile toward alternative viewpoints and is not restricted to publishing only articles regarding the government. The government allowed a printing and publishing company, Brunei Press PLC, to form in 1953. The company continues to print the English daily "<a href="Borneo%20Bulletin">Borneo Bulletin</a>". This paper began as a weekly community paper and became a daily in 1990 Apart from The "Borneo Bulletin", there is also the "<a href="Media%20Permata">Media Permata</a>" and Pelita Brunei, the local Malay newspapers which are circulated daily.

The country has competed in badminton, shooting, swimming, and track-and-field, but is yet to win any medals. Brunei has had slightly more success <a href="Brunei%20at%20the%20Asian%20Games">at the Asian Games</a>, winning four bronze medals. The first major international sporting event to be hosted in Brunei was the <a href="1999%20Southeast%20Asian%20Games">1999 Southeast Asian Games</a>. According to the <a href="all-time%20Southeast%20Asian%20Games%20medal%20table">all-time Southeast Asian Games medal table</a>, Bruneian athletes have won a total of 11 gold medals at the games; only <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> has won fewer.

Brunei has numerous courts in its judicial branch. The highest court is the Supreme Court, which consists of the Court of Appeal and High Court. Both of these have a chief justice and two judges.

The U.S. Department of State has stated that discrimination against women is a problem in Brunei. The law prohibits sexual harassment and stipulates that whoever assaults or uses criminal force, intending thereby to outrage or knowing it is likely to outrage the modesty of a person, shall be punished with imprisonment for as much as five years and <a href="caning">caning</a>. The law stipulates imprisonment of up to 30 years, and caning with not fewer than 12 strokes for rape. The law does not criminalise spousal rape; it explicitly states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, as long as she is not under 13 years of age, is not rape. Protections against sexual assault by a spouse are provided under the amended Islamic Family Law Order 2010 and Married Women Act Order 2010. The penalty for breaching a protection order is a fine not exceeding BN$2,000 ($1,538) or imprisonment not exceeding six months.

Citizenship is derived through one's parents rather than through birth within the country's territory. Parents with stateless status are required to apply for a special pass for a child born in the country; failure to register a child may make it difficult to enroll the child in school. By law sexual intercourse with a female under 14 years of age constitutes rape and is punishable by imprisonment for not less than eight years and not more than thirty years and not less than twelve strokes of the cane. The intent of the law is to protect girls from exploitation through prostitution and "other immoral purposes" including pornography.

Brunei's revised penal code came into force on 22 April 2014, stipulating the <a href="death%20penalty">death penalty</a> for numerous offenses (both violent and non-violent), such insult or defamation of the Prophet Mohammed, insulting any verses of the Quran and Hadith, <a href="blasphemy">blasphemy</a>, declaring oneself a prophet or non-Muslim, robbery, rape, adultery, sodomy, extramarital sexual relations for Muslims and murder. Stoning to death was the specified "method of execution for crimes of a sexual nature." Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) declared that, "Application of the death penalty for such a broad range of offences contravenes international law." 

Male and female <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a> is <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Brunei">illegal in Brunei</a>. The country passed a law that came into force on 22 April 2014, allowing the death penalty to be administered by <a href="stoning">stoning</a> for homosexual acts, such as sexual intercourse, given there is enough evidence pointing to the action (i.e. with four trusted, impartial, and truthful witnesses in attendance). It has been acknowledged as a crime in Brunei with the introduction of the <a href="Sharia">Sharia</a> law. The law also stipulates that adultery is to be punished with death by stoning given there is enough evidence pointing to the action (i.e. with four trusted, impartial, and truthful witnesses in attendance). Without four qualified witnesses, there will be no stoning.

As of August 2015, there were no cases within the Sharia Penal Code that would entail the death penalty without four qualified witnesses.

Upon adopting sharia, the Sultan banned <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> decorations in public places such as shopping malls, believing that it might interfere with the practise of Islam. However, local and foreign Christians are still allowed to celebrate Christmas as usual. On 25 December 2015, 4,000 out of 18,000 estimated local Catholics attended the mass of Christmas Day and Christmas Eve.

"To be quite honest there has been no change for us this year; no new restrictions have been laid down, although we fully respect and adhere to the existing regulations that our celebrations and worship be [confined] to the compounds of the church and private residences," according to <a href="Bishop%20Cornelius%20Sim">Bishop Cornelius Sim</a>, head of the Catholic Church in Brunei.

Brunei is the first country in Asia to ban shark finning nationwide.

Selling other rare animals, such as <a href="pangolins">pangolins</a> and endangered birds, are considered serious crimes; however, Brunei lacks animal rights enforcers.

There are four government-run hospitals in Brunei, one for every district. There are also 16 health centres and 10 health clinics.

Healthcare in Brunei is charged at B$1 per consultation for citizens and is free for anyone under 12 years old. A health centre run by Brunei Shell Petroleum is located in <a href="Panaga">Panaga</a>. For medical assistance not available in the country, citizens are sent overseas at the government's expense. In the period of 2011–12, 327 patients were treated in Malaysia and Singapore at the cost to the government of $12 million.

Brunei has 2.8 hospital beds per 1000 people. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is currently at 0.1%, and numerous AIDS awareness campaigns are currently being held.

7.5% of the population are obese, the highest prevalence rate in <a href="ASEAN">ASEAN</a>. Also, studies by the Ministry of Health show that at least 20% of schoolchildren in Brunei are either overweight or obese.

The largest hospital in Brunei is <a href="Raja%20Isteri%20Pengiran%20Anak%20Saleha%20Hospital">Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital</a> (RIPAS) hospital, which had 550 beds in year 1992, is situated in the country's capital <a href="Bandar%20Seri%20Begawan">Bandar Seri Begawan</a>. There are two private medical centres, Gleneagles JPMC Sdn Bhd . and <a href="Jerudong%20Park%20Medical%20Centre">Jerudong Park Medical Centre</a>. The Health Promotion Centre opened in November 2008 and serves to educate the public on the importance of having a healthy lifestyle.

There is currently no <a href="medical%20school">medical school</a> in Brunei, and Bruneians wishing to study to become doctors must attend university overseas. However, the Institute of Medicines had been introduced at the <a href="Universiti%20Brunei%20Darussalam">Universiti Brunei Darussalam</a> and a new building has been built for the faculty. The building, including research lab facilities, was completed in 2009. There has been a School of Nursing since 1951. Fifty-eight nurse managers were appointed in RIPAS to improve service and provide better medical care. In December 2008, The nursing college merged with the Institute of Medicines at the Universiti Brunei Darussalam to produce more nurses and midwives. It is now called the PAPRSB (Pengiran Anak Puteri Rashidah Sa'datul Bolkiah) Institute of Health Sciences.

British Virgin Islands

The British Virgin Islands (BVI), officially simply "Virgin Islands", are a <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territory">British Overseas Territory</a> in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, to the east of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. The islands are geographically part of the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands archipelago</a> and are located in the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a> of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>.

The British Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of <a href="Tortola">Tortola</a>, <a href="Virgin%20Gorda">Virgin Gorda</a>, <a href="Anegada">Anegada</a>, and <a href="Jost%20Van%20Dyke">Jost Van Dyke</a>, along with over 50 other smaller islands and <a href="cay">cay</a>s. About 15 of the islands are inhabited. The capital, <a href="Road%20Town">Road Town</a>, is on Tortola, the largest island, which is about long and wide. The islands had a population of about 28,000 at the 2010 Census, of whom approximately 23,500 lived on Tortola. For the islands, the latest United Nations estimate () is .

British Virgin Islanders are <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories%20citizen">British Overseas Territories citizen</a>s and since 2002 are <a href="British%20citizen">British citizen</a>s as well. Although the territory is not part of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and not directly subject to EU law, British Virgin Islanders are deemed to be citizens of the EU by virtue of their British citizenship.

Parts of the islands were damaged in September 2017 by <a href="Hurricane%20Irma">Hurricane Irma</a> and an estimated ten people were killed by the storm. The most severe destruction appeared to be on <a href="Tortola">Tortola</a>.

The official name of the territory is still simply the "Virgin Islands", but the prefix "British" is often used. This is commonly believed to distinguish it from the neighbouring American territory which changed its name from the "<a href="Danish%20West%20Indies">Danish West Indies</a>" to "Virgin Islands of the United States" in 1917. However, local historians have disputed this, pointing to a variety of publications and public records dating from between 21 February 1857 and 12 September 1919 where the Territory is referred to as the "British" Virgin Islands. British Virgin Islands government publications continue to begin with the name "The territory of the Virgin Islands", and <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands%20passport">the territory's passports</a> simply refer to the "Virgin Islands", and all laws begin with the words "Virgin Islands". Moreover, the territory's Constitutional Commission has expressed the view that "every effort should be made" to encourage the use of the name "Virgin Islands". But various public and quasi public bodies continue to use the name "British Virgin Islands" or "BVI", including BVI Finance, BVI Electricity Corporation, BVI Tourist Board, BVI Athletic Association, <a href="BVI%20Bar%20Association">BVI Bar Association</a> and others.

In 1968 the British Government issued a memorandum requiring that the postage stamps in the territory should say "British Virgin Islands" (whereas previously they had simply stated "Virgin Islands"), a practice which is still followed today. This was likely to prevent confusion following on from the adoption of US currency in the Territory in 1959, and the references to US currency on the stamps of the Territory.

The Virgin Islands were first settled by the <a href="Arawak%20peoples">Arawak</a> from South America around 100 BC (though there is some evidence of <a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a> presence on the islands as far back as 1500 BC). The Arawaks inhabited the islands until the 15th century when they were displaced by the more aggressive <a href="Island%20Caribs">Caribs</a>, a tribe from the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> islands, after whom the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> is named.

The first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> in 1493 on his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus gave them the fanciful name "Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Vírgenes" (Saint Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins), shortened to "Las Vírgenes" (The Virgins), after the legend of <a href="Saint%20Ursula">Saint Ursula</a>.

The <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a> claimed the islands by discovery in the early 16th century, but never settled them, and subsequent years saw the English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and Danish all jostling for control of the region, which became a notorious haunt for pirates. There is no record of any native Amerindian population in the British Virgin Islands during this period, although most of the native population on nearby <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Croix</a> was killed or dispersed.

The Dutch established a <a href="Dutch%20Virgin%20Islands">permanent settlement</a> on the island of <a href="Tortola">Tortola</a> by 1648. In 1672, the English captured Tortola from the Dutch, and the English annexation of <a href="Anegada">Anegada</a> and <a href="Virgin%20Gorda">Virgin Gorda</a> followed in 1680. Meanwhile, over the period 1672–1733, the Danish gained control of the nearby islands of <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Thomas</a>, <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint John</a> and <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Croix</a>.
The British islands were considered principally a strategic possession, but were planted when economic conditions were particularly favourable. The British introduced <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a> which was to become the main crop and source of foreign trade, and slaves were brought from Africa to work on the sugar cane plantations. The islands prospered economically until the middle of the nineteenth century, when a combination of the <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">abolition of slavery in the territory</a>, a series of disastrous hurricanes, and the growth in the <a href="sugar%20beet">sugar beet</a> crop in Europe and the United States significantly reduced sugar cane production and led to a period of economic decline.

In 1917, the United States purchased St. John, St. Thomas, and St. Croix from Denmark for US$25 million, renaming them the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>.

The British Virgin Islands were administered variously as part of the <a href="British%20Leeward%20Islands">British Leeward Islands</a> or with <a href="St.%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis">St. Kitts and Nevis</a>, with an administrator representing the British Government on the islands. The islands gained separate colony status in 1960 and became autonomous in 1967. Since the 1960s, the islands have diversified away from their traditionally agriculture-based economy towards tourism and financial services, becoming one of the wealthiest areas in the Caribbean.

The British Virgin Islands comprise around 60 tropical Caribbean islands, ranging in size from the largest, Tortola long and wide, to tiny uninhabited <a href="islet">islet</a>s, altogether about in extent. They are located in the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands archipelago</a>, a few miles east of the US Virgin Islands. The <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic Ocean</a> lies to the north of the islands, and the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> lies to the south. Most of the islands are volcanic in origin and have a hilly, rugged terrain. Anegada is geologically distinct from the rest of the group and is a flat island composed of limestone and coral.

In addition to the four main islands of <a href="Tortola">Tortola</a>, <a href="Virgin%20Gorda">Virgin Gorda</a>, <a href="Anegada">Anegada</a>, and <a href="Jost%20Van%20Dyke">Jost Van Dyke</a>, other islands include (see also ):

The British Virgin Islands have a <a href="tropical%20rainforest%20climate">tropical rainforest climate</a>, moderated by <a href="trade%20winds">trade winds</a>. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. In the capital, <a href="Road%20Town">Road Town</a>, typical daily maxima are around in the summer and in the winter. Typical daily minima are around in the summer and in the winter. Rainfall averages about per year, higher in the hills and lower on the coast. Rainfall can be quite variable, but the wettest months on average are September to November and the driest months on average are February and March. 
Hurricanes occasionally hit the islands, with the hurricane season running from June to November. <a href="Hurricane%20Danny%20%282015%29">Hurricane Danny (2015)</a> was the most recent until 7 September 2017 when Hurricane Irma caused extensive damage, particularly on Tortola, as well as four deaths in the BVI. A state of emergency was declared by the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency. The most significant damage was on Tortola. The UK's Foreign Secretary <a href="Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</a> visited Tortola on 13 September 2017 and said that he was reminded of photos of Hiroshima after it had been hit by the atom bomb.

By 8 September, the UK government sent troops with medical supplies and other aid. More troops were expected to arrive a day or two later, but the ship
HMS Ocean, carrying more extensive assistance, was not expected to reach the islands for another two weeks, however.

Entrepreneur <a href="Richard%20Branson">Richard Branson</a>, a resident of <a href="Necker%20Island%20%28British%20Virgin%20Islands%29">Necker Island (British Virgin Islands)</a>, called on the UK government to develop a massive disaster recovery plan for British islands that were damaged. That should include "both through short-term aid and long-term infrastructure spending", he said. Premier Orlando Smith also called for a comprehensive aid package to rebuild the BVI. On 10 September, PM Theresa May pledged £32 million to the Caribbean for a Hurricane relief fund; the UK government would also match donations made by the public via the British Red Cross appeal. Specifics were not provided to the news media as to the amount that would be allocated to the Virgin Islands. Boris Johnson's visit to Tortola on 13 September 2017 during his Caribbean tour was intended to confirm the UK's commitment to helping restore British islands but he provided no additional comments on the aid package. He did confirm that <a href="HMS%20Ocean%20%28L12%29">HMS Ocean (L12)</a> was on the way to the BVI items like timber, buckets, bottled water, food, baby milk, bedding and clothing, as well as ten pickup trucks, building materials and hardware.

The territory operates as a <a href="Parliamentary%20system">parliamentary democracy</a>. Ultimate executive authority in British Virgin Islands is vested in <a href="Elizabeth%20II">the Queen</a>, and is exercised on her behalf by the <a href="Governor%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Governor of the British Virgin Islands</a>. The governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the <a href="British%20Government">British government</a>. Defence and most foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">most recent constitution</a> was adopted in 2007 (the Virgin Islands Constitution Order, 2007) and came into force when the <a href="Legislative%20Council%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Legislative Council</a> was dissolved for the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands%20general%20election%2C%202007">2007 general election</a>. The head of government under the constitution is the <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Premier</a> (before the new constitution the office was referred to as <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Chief Minister</a>), who is elected in a general election along with the other members of the ruling government as well as the members of the opposition. <a href="Elections%20in%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Elections</a> are held roughly every four years. A <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">cabinet</a> is nominated by the Premier and appointed and chaired by the Governor. The Legislature consists of the Queen (represented by the Governor) and a <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> <a href="House%20of%20Assembly%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">House of Assembly</a> made up of 13 elected members plus the <a href="List%20of%20Speakers%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Assembly%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Speaker</a> and the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Attorney General</a>.

The current Governor is <a href="Augustus%20Jaspert">Augustus Jaspert</a> (since 22 August 2017). The current Premier is <a href="Orlando%20Smith">Orlando Smith</a> (since 9 November 2011), who is leader of the ruling <a href="National%20Democratic%20Party%20%28British%20Virgin%20Islands%29">National Democratic Party</a>.

The British Virgin Islands is a unitary territory. The territory is divided into nine electoral districts, and each voter is registered in one of those districts. Eight of the nine districts are partly or wholly on Tortola, and encompass nearby neighbouring islands. Only the ninth district (Virgin Gorda and Anegada) does not include any part of Tortola. At elections, in addition to voting their local representative, voters also cast votes for four "at-large" candidates who are elected upon a territory-wide basis.

The territory is also technically divided into five administrative districts (one for each of the four largest islands, and then a fifth for all other islands), and into six civil registry districts (three for Tortola, Jost Van Dyke, Virgin Gorda and Anegada) although these have little practical relevance today.

Crime in the British Virgin Islands is comparatively low by Caribbean standards (and indeed compared to the neighbouring US Virgin Islands). Whilst statistics and hard data are relatively rare, and are not regularly published by governmental sources in the British Virgin Islands, the Premier did announce that in 2013 there has been a 14% decline in recorded crime as against 2012. Homicides are rare, with just one incident recorded in 2013. The British and US Virgin Islands sit at the axis of a major drugs transshipment point between Latin America and the continental United States. The <a href="Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration">American DEA</a> regards the adjacent US territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as a "High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area". A co-operation agreement exists between the British Virgin Islands and the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">US Coast Guard</a> allowing American forces to pursue suspected drug traffickers through the territorial waters of the British Virgin Islands. In August 2011 a joint raid between the <a href="Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration">American DEA</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Virgin%20Islands%20Police%20Force">Royal Virgin Islands Police Force</a> arrested a number of British Virgin Islands residents who are accused of being involved in major drugs <a href="transshipment">transshipment</a>s, although their extradition to the United States has become bogged down in protracted legal wrangling.

As a <a href="tax%20haven">tax haven</a> with an opaque banking system, the British Virgin Islands enjoys one of the more prosperous economies of the Caribbean region, with a per capita average income of around $42,300 (2010 est.) 
The average monthly income earned by a worker in the territory was US$2,452 as at the time of the 2010 Census. 29% of the population fell into the "low income" category.

Although it is common to hear criticism in the British Virgin Islands' press about <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20income%20equality">income inequality</a>, no serious attempt has been made by economists to calculate a <a href="Gini%20coefficient">Gini coefficient</a> or similar measure of income equality for the territory. A report from 2000 suggested that, despite the popular perception, income inequality was actually lower in the British Virgin Islands than in any other OECS state, although in global terms income equality is higher in the Caribbean than in many other regions.

The "twin pillars" of the economy are tourism and financial services. Politically, tourism is the more important of the two, as it employs a greater number of people within the territory, and a larger proportion of the businesses in the tourist industry are locally owned, as are a number of the highly tourism-dependent sole traders (for example, taxi drivers and street vendors). Economically however, financial services associated with the territory's status as an offshore financial centre are by far the more important. 51.8% of the Government's revenue comes directly from licence fees for offshore companies, and considerable further sums are raised directly or indirectly from payroll taxes relating to salaries paid within the trust industry sector (which tend to be higher on average than those paid in the tourism sector).

Tourism accounts for approximately 45% of national income. The islands are a popular destination for US citizens. In 2006 a total of 825,603 people visited the islands, of whom 443,987 were cruise ship passengers. Tourists frequent the numerous white sand beaches, visit <a href="The%20Baths">The Baths on Virgin Gorda</a>, <a href="Snorkeling">snorkel</a> the <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s near Anegada, or experience the well-known bars of Jost Van Dyke. The BVI are known as one of the world's greatest sailing destinations, and charter sailboats are a very popular way to visit less accessible islands. Every year since 1972 the BVI has hosted the Spring Regatta, which is a seven-day collection of sailing races throughout the islands. A substantial number of the tourists who visit the BVI are <a href="cruise%20ship">cruise ship</a> passengers, and although they produce far lower revenue per head than charter boat tourists and hotel based tourists, they are nonetheless important to the substantial - and politically important - taxi driving community. Only Virgin Islanders are permitted to work as taxi drivers.

Financial services account for over half of the income of the territory. The majority of this revenue is generated by the licensing of <a href="offshore%20company">offshore companies</a> and related services. The British Virgin Islands is a significant global player in the <a href="offshore%20financial%20centre">offshore financial services industry</a>. In 2000 <a href="KPMG">KPMG</a> reported in its survey of <a href="Tax%20haven">offshore jurisdictions</a> for the United Kingdom government that over 45% of the world's offshore companies were formed in the British Virgin Islands. Since 2001, financial services in the British Virgin Islands have been regulated by the independent <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands%20Financial%20Services%20Commission">Financial Services Commission</a>.

At the end of 2012 the banking sector of the British Virgin Islands comprised six commercial banks and one restricted bank, 12 authorised custodians, two licensed money services businesses and one licensed financing service provider.

As such the British Virgin Islands is frequently labelled as a "<a href="tax%20haven">tax haven</a>" by campaigners and NGOs, and has been expressly named in anti-tax haven legislation in other countries on various occasions. Successive governments in the British Virgin Islands have fought against the tax haven label, and made various commitments to tax exchange and recording beneficial ownership information of companies following the <a href="39th%20G8%20summit">2013 G8 summit</a>. On 10 September 2013 British Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> said "I do not think it is fair any longer to refer to any of the Overseas Territories or Crown Dependencies as tax havens. They have taken action to make sure that they have fair and open tax systems. It is very important that our focus should now shift to those territories and countries that really are tax havens."

In the April 2016 <a href="Panama%20Papers">Panama Papers</a> leak, the British Virgin Islands was the most commonly used tax haven by clients of <a href="Mossack%20Fonseca">Mossack Fonseca</a>.

On June 30, 2014, The British Virgin Islands was deemed to have an Inter- Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States of America with respect to the "Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act" of the United States of America.

The Model 1 Agreement (14 Pages) recognizes that:

The Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland provided a copy of the Letter of Entrustment which was sent to the Government of the British Virgin Islands, to the Government of the United States of America "via diplomatic note of May 28, 2014".

The Letter of Entrustment dated July 14, 2010 was originally provided to the Government of the British Virgin Islands and authorized the Govt of the BVI "to negotiate and conclude Agreements relating to taxation that provide for exchange of information on tax matters to the OECD standard" (Paragraph 2 of the FATCA Agreement).

Via an "Entrustment Letter" dated March 24, 2014, The Govt of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, authorized the Govt of the BVI to sign an agreement on information exchange to facilitate the Implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 
On March 27, 2017, the US Treasury site disclosed that the Model 1 agreement and related agreement were "In Force" on July 13, 2015.

Agriculture and industry account for only a small proportion of the islands' GDP. Agricultural produce includes fruit, vegetables, sugar cane, livestock and poultry, and industries include rum distillation, construction and boat building.

The official currency of the British Virgin Islands has been the <a href="United%20States%20dollar">United States dollar</a> (US$) since 1959, the currency also used by the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>.

The British Virgin Islands is heavily dependent on migrant workers, and over 50% of all workers on the islands are of a foreign descent. Only 37% of the entire population were born in the territory. The national labour-force is estimated at 12,770, of whom approximately 59.4% work in the service sector but less than 0.6% are estimated to work in agriculture (the balance in industry).

According to the membership section of the CARICOM Community site, as of July 2, 1991, The British Virgin Islands holds Associate Member status in CARICOM.

In recognition of the CARICOM (Free Movement) Skilled Persons Act which came into effect in July 1997 in some of the CARICOM countries such as Jamaica and which has been adopted in other CARICOM countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago, it is possible that CARICOM nationals who hold the "A Certificate of Recognition of Caribbean Community Skilled Person" may be allowed to work in the BVI under normal working conditions.

There are of roads. The main airport, <a href="Terrance%20B.%20Lettsome%20International%20Airport">Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport</a>, also known as Beef Island Airport, is located on Beef Island, which lies off the eastern tip of Tortola and is accessible by the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%20Bridge%2C%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Queen Elizabeth II Bridge</a>. <a href="Cape%20Air">Cape Air</a>, <a href="LIAT">LIAT</a> and <a href="Air%20Sunshine">Air Sunshine</a> are amongst the airlines offering scheduled service. Virgin Gorda and Anegada have their own smaller airports. Private air charter services operated by <a href="Island%20Birds">Island Birds</a> Air Charter fly directly to all three islands from any major airport in the Caribbean. Helicopters are used to get to islands with no runway facilities; Antilles Helicopter Services is the only helicopter service based in the country. The main harbour is in <a href="Road%20Town">Road Town</a>. There are also ferries that operate within the British Virgin Islands and to the neighbouring United States Virgin Islands. As in the UK and in the United States Virgin Islands, cars in the British Virgin Islands <a href="Right-%20and%20left-hand%20traffic%23Jurisdictions%20with%20left-hand%20traffic">drive on the left</a>, however they differ in that nearly all cars are <a href="left%20hand%20drive">left hand drive</a>, being imported from the United States. The roads are often quite steep, narrow and winding, and ruts can be a problem when it rains.

<a href="Cyril%20E.%20King%20Airport">Cyril E. King Airport</a> in the US Virgin Islands has flights to a wider range of destinations, so is also used for travelling to the British Virgin Islands.

As of the 2010 Census, the population of the territory was 28,054 At the time of the 2003 census the population was around 21,730. The majority of the population (83%) are <a href="wikt%3AAfro-Caribbean">Afro-Caribbean</a>, descended from slaves brought to the islands by the British. Other large ethnic groups include those of British and other European origin.

The 2004 Census reports:
The 2010 Census reports the main places of origin of residents as follows:
About 4% of the population is of Hispanic origin, irrespective of race, primarily from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The territory has also been recently relieving immigrants from many islands in <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. The islands are heavily dependent upon migrant labour. In 2004, migrant workers accounted for 50% of the total population. 32% of workers employed in the British Virgin Islands work for the government.

Unusually, the territory has one of the highest drowning mortality rates in the world being higher than other high risk countries such as China and India. 20% of deaths in the British Virgin Islands during 2012 were recorded as drownings, all of them being tourists. Despite this, the territory's most popular beach still has no lifeguard presence.

The British Virgin Islands operates several government schools as well as private schools. There is also a community college, <a href="H.%20Lavity%20Stoutt%20Community%20College">H. Lavity Stoutt Community College</a>, that is located on the eastern end of Tortola. This college was named after <a href="Lavity%20Stoutt">Lavity Stoutt</a>, the first Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands. It is extremely common for students from the British Virgin Islands to travel overseas for tertiary education, either to the <a href="University%20of%20the%20West%20Indies">University of the West Indies</a>, or to colleges and universities in either the United Kingdom, United States, or Canada.

The literacy rate in the British Virgin Islands is high at 98%.

Over 90% of the population who indicated a religious affiliation at the 2010 Census were Christian with the largest individual Christian denominations being <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> (17.6%), <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> (12%), <a href="Church%20of%20God%20%28Cleveland%2C%20Tennessee%29">Church of God</a> (11%) and <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> (9%). The <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">Constitution of the British Virgin Islands</a> commences with a professed national belief in <a href="God">God</a>. <a href="Hindus">Hindus</a> and <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s constitute each approximately 1.2% of the population according to Word Religion Database 2005.

The primary language is <a href="English%20language">English</a>, although there is a local <a href="Virgin%20Islands%20Creole">dialect</a>. Spanish is spoken by <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20people">Puerto Rican</a>, <a href="People%20of%20the%20Dominican%20Republic">Dominican</a> and other Spanish-speaking immigrants.

The traditional music of the British Virgin Islands is called "fungi" after the local <a href="cornmeal">cornmeal</a> dish with the same name, often made with <a href="okra">okra</a>. The special sound of fungi is due to a unique local fusion between African and European music. It functions as a medium of local history and folklore and is therefore a cherished cultural form of expression that is part of the curriculum in BVI schools. The fungi bands, also called "scratch bands", use instruments ranging from <a href="calabash">calabash</a>, washboard, <a href="Bongo%20drum">bongos</a> and <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a>, to more traditional western instruments like keyboard, banjo, guitar, bass, triangle and saxophone. Apart from being a form of festive dance music, fungi often contains humorous social commentaries, as well as BVI oral history.

Among the noted names in Virgin Islands literature are Alphaeus Osario Norman (1885-1942), Verna Penn Moll, Jennie Wheatley, and Patricia G. Turnbull. Their poetry and that of 22 other writers, including the fastly emerging poet and literary critic Richard Georges, can be found in "Where I See the Sun – Contemporary Poetry in The Virgin Islands (Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost Van Dyke)", an anthology edited by <a href="Lasana%20M.%20Sekou">Lasana M. Sekou</a> in 2016.

Because of its location and climate the British Virgin Islands has long been a haven for sailing enthusiasts. Sailing is regarded as one of the foremost sports in all of the BVI. Calm waters and steady breezes provide some of the best sailing conditions in the Caribbean.

Many sailing events are held in the waters of this country, the largest of which is a week-long series of races called the Spring Regatta, the premier sailing event of the Caribbean, with several races hosted each day. Boats include everything from full-size mono-hull yachts to dinghies. Captains and their crews come from all around the world to attend these races. The Spring Regatta is part race, part party, part festival. There are races, games, and music during the day, and some partying at night. The Spring Regatta is normally held during the first week of April.

Since 2009, the BVI have made a name for themselves as a host of international basketball events. The BVI hosted three of the last four events of the <a href="Caribbean%20Basketball%20Championship">Caribbean Basketball Championship</a> ("FIBA CBC Championship").

Burkina Faso

Burkina Faso ( ; ) is a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a> in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. It covers an area of around and is surrounded by six countries: <a href="Mali">Mali</a> to the north; <a href="Niger">Niger</a> to the east; <a href="Benin">Benin</a> to the southeast; <a href="Togo">Togo</a> and <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> to the south; and <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a> to the southwest. Its capital is <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>. In 2014 its population was estimated at just over 17.3 million. Burkina Faso is a <a href="francophone">francophone</a> country and <a href="French%20language">French</a> is an official language of government and business. Formerly called the <a href="Republic%20of%20Upper%20Volta">Republic of Upper Volta</a>, the country was <a href="Geographical%20renaming">renamed</a> "Burkina Faso" on 4 August 1984 by then-President <a href="Thomas%20Sankara">Thomas Sankara</a>. The citizens of Burkina Faso are known as "Burkinabé" ( ).

The northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s from 14000 BC to 5000 BC. From the 3rd to the 13th centuries AD, the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="Bura%20culture">Bura culture</a> existed in the territory of present-day southeastern Burkina Faso and southwestern Niger. Various ethnic groups of present-day Burkina Faso, such as the <a href="Mossi%20people">Mossi</a>, <a href="Fula%20people">Fula</a> and <a href="Dyula%20people">Dyula</a>, arrived in successive waves between the 8th and 15th centuries. From the 11th century the Mossi people established <a href="Mossi%20Kingdoms">several separate kingdoms</a>. In the 1890s, during the European <a href="Scramble%20for%20Africa">Scramble for Africa</a>, the territory of Burkina Faso was invaded by <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">France</a>, and <a href="Colonialism">colonial</a> control was established following a war of conquest between 1896 and 1904. The territory was made part of <a href="French%20West%20Africa">French West Africa</a> in 1904, and the colony of <a href="French%20Upper%20Volta">French Upper Volta</a> was established on 1 March 1919. The colony was named for its location on the upper courses of the <a href="Volta%20River">Volta River</a> (the <a href="Black%20Volta">Black</a>, <a href="Red%20Volta">Red</a> and <a href="White%20Volta">White Volta</a>).

The <a href="Republic%20of%20Upper%20Volta">Republic of Upper Volta</a> was established on 11 December 1958 as a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> within the <a href="French%20Community">French Community</a>, and on 5 August 1960 it gained full independence, with <a href="Maurice%20Yam%C3%A9ogo">Maurice Yaméogo</a> as <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">President</a>. After protests by students and <a href="Trade%20union">labour unions</a>, Yaméogo was deposed in the <a href="1966%20Upper%20Voltan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1966 coup d'état</a> led by <a href="Sangoul%C3%A9%20Lamizana">Sangoulé Lamizana</a>, who became President. His rule coincided with the <a href="Sahel%20drought">Sahel drought and famine</a>, and facing problems from the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, he was deposed in the <a href="1980%20Upper%20Voltan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1980 coup d'état</a> led by <a href="Saye%20Zerbo">Saye Zerbo</a>. Encountering resistance from trade unions again, Zerbo's government was overthrown in the <a href="1982%20Upper%20Voltan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1982 coup d'état</a> led by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Ou%C3%A9draogo">Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo</a>. The leader of the leftist faction of Ouédraogo's government, <a href="Thomas%20Sankara">Thomas Sankara</a>, became <a href="List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">Prime Minister</a> but was later imprisoned. Efforts to free him led to the popularly-supported 1983 coup d'état, in which he became President. Sankara renamed the country Burkina Faso and launched an ambitious socioeconomic program which included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of <a href="female%20genital%20mutilation">female genital mutilation</a>, <a href="forced%20marriage">forced marriage</a>s and <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a>. Sankara was overthrown and killed in the 1987 coup d'état led by <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Blaise Compaoré</a> – deteriorating relations with former coloniser France and its ally the Ivory Coast was the reason given for the coup.

In 1987 Blaise Compaoré became President and, after an alleged <a href="1989%20Burkinab%C3%A9%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt">1989 coup attempt</a>, was later elected in <a href="Burkinab%C3%A9%20presidential%20election%2C%201991">1991</a> and <a href="Burkinab%C3%A9%20presidential%20election%2C%201998">1998</a>, elections which were boycotted by the opposition and received a considerably low turnout, as well as in <a href="Burkinab%C3%A9%20presidential%20election%2C%202005">2005</a>. He remained head of state until he was ousted from power by the <a href="2014%20Burkinab%C3%A9%20uprising">popular youth upheaval</a> of 31 October 2014, after which he fled to the Ivory Coast. <a href="Michel%20Kafando">Michel Kafando</a> subsequently became the transitional President of the country. On 16 September 2015 a <a href="2015%20Burkinab%C3%A9%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">military coup d'état</a> against the Kafando government was carried out by the <a href="Regiment%20of%20Presidential%20Security">Regiment of Presidential Security</a>, the former presidential guard of Compaoré. On 24 September 2015, after pressure from the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a>, <a href="ECOWAS">ECOWAS</a> and the armed forces, the military junta agreed to step down, and Michel Kafando was reinstated as Acting President. In the <a href="Burkinab%C3%A9%20general%20election%2C%202015">general election held on 29 November 2015</a>, <a href="Roch%20Marc%20Christian%20Kabor%C3%A9">Roch Marc Christian Kaboré</a> won in the first round with 53.5% of the vote and was sworn in as President on 29 December 2015.

Formerly called the Republic of Upper Volta, the country was renamed "Burkina Faso" on 4 August 1984 by then-President Thomas Sankara. The words "Burkina" and "Faso" both stem from different languages spoken in the country: "Burkina" comes from <a href="Mossi%20language">Mossi</a> and means "honest" or "honest people", while "Faso" comes from the <a href="Dyula%20language">Dyula language</a> and means "fatherland" (lit. "father's house"). The "bé" suffix added onto "Burkina" to form the demonym "Burkinabé" comes from the <a href="Fula%20language">Fula language</a> and means "men or women".

The French colony of Upper Volta was named for its location on the upper courses of the <a href="Volta%20River">Volta River</a> (the <a href="Black%20Volta">Black</a>, <a href="Red%20Volta">Red</a> and <a href="White%20Volta">White Volta</a>).

The northwestern part of today's Burkina Faso was populated by <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s between 14,000 and 5,000 BC. Their tools, including <a href="scraper%20%28archaeology%29">scrapers</a>, <a href="chisel">chisel</a>s and <a href="arrowhead">arrowhead</a>s, were discovered in 1973 through <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">archaeological excavations</a>. <a href="Agricultural">Agricultural</a> settlements were established between 3600 and 2600 BC. The <a href="Bura%20culture">Bura culture</a> was an <a href="iron%20age">Iron-Age</a> <a href="civilization">civilization</a> centred in the southwest portion of modern-day Niger and in the southeast part of contemporary Burkina Faso. <a href="Iron%20industry">Iron industry</a>, in <a href="smelting">smelting</a> and <a href="forging">forging</a> for tools and weapons, had developed in <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> by 1200 BC.

Historians began to debate about the exact dates when Burkina Faso's many ethnic groups arrived to the area. The <a href="Moosei%20people">Proto-Mossi</a> arrived in the far Eastern part of what is today Burkina Faso sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, the <a href="Samo%20language%20%28Burkina%29">Samo</a> arrived around the 15th century, the <a href="Dogon%20people">Dogon</a> lived in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries, and many of the other ethnic groups that make up the country's population arrived in the region during this time.

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> the Mossi established several separate kingdoms including those of Tenkodogo, Yatenga, Zandoma, and Ouagadougou. Sometime between 1328 and 1338 Mossi warriors raided <a href="Timbuktu">Timbuktu</a> but the Mossi were defeated by <a href="Sonni%20Ali">Sonni Ali</a> of <a href="Songhai%20Empire">Songhai</a> at the Battle of Kobi in <a href="Mali">Mali</a> in 1483.

During the early 16th century the Songhai conducted many slave raids into what is today Burkina Faso. During the 18th century the Gwiriko Empire was established at <a href="Bobo%20Dioulasso">Bobo Dioulasso</a> and ethnic groups such as the Dyan, Lobi, and Birifor settled along the <a href="Black%20Volta">Black Volta</a>.

Starting in the early 1890s a series of <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a>, <a href="France">French</a> and <a href="Germany">German</a> military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today Burkina Faso. At times these <a href="colonialists">colonialists</a> and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties. The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties amongst themselves. Through a complex series of events what is Burkina Faso eventually became a French protectorate in 1896.

The eastern and western regions, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler <a href="Samori%20Ture">Samori Ture</a> complicated the situation, came under French occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso was nominally conquered; however, French control of many parts remained uncertain.

The <a href="Anglo-French%20Convention%20of%201898">Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898</a> created the country's modern borders. In the French territory, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the <a href="Volta%20River">Volta basin</a> were integrated into the <a href="Upper%20Senegal%20and%20Niger">Upper Senegal and Niger</a> colony of <a href="French%20West%20Africa">French West Africa</a> as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in <a href="Bamako">Bamako</a>.

The language of colonial administration and schooling became French. The public education system started from humble origins. Advanced education was provided for many years during the colonial period in Dakar.

<a href="Conscription">Draftees</a> from the territory participated in the European fronts of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in the battalions of the <a href="Tirailleurs%20s%C3%A9n%C3%A9galais">Senegalese Rifles</a>. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government: the <a href="Volta-Bani%20War">Volta-Bani War</a>.

The French government finally suppressed the movement but only after suffering defeats. It also had to organize its largest expeditionary force of its colonial history to send into the country to suppress the insurrection. Armed opposition wracked the Sahelian north when the <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg</a> and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.
<a href="French%20Upper%20Volta">French Upper Volta</a> was established on 1 March 1919. The French feared a recurrence of armed uprising and had related economic considerations. To bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger.

The new colony was named "<a href="French%20Upper%20Volta">Haute Volta</a>," and François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling became its first <a href="List%20of%20governors%20of%20Upper%20Volta">governor</a>. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program to improve infrastructure and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy – based on <a href="coercion">coercion</a> – failed, and revenue generated by the colony stagnated. The colony was dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split between the French colonies of <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, <a href="French%20Sudan">French Sudan</a> and <a href="Niger">Niger</a>. Ivory Coast received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and <a href="Bobo-Dioulasso">Bobo-Dioulasso</a>.

France reversed this change during the period of intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. On 4 September 1947, it revived the colony of Upper Volta, with its previous boundaries, as a part of the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a>. The French designated its colonies as departments of <a href="metropolitan%20France">metropolitan France</a> on the European continent.

On 11 December 1958 the colony achieved <a href="Self-governance">self-government</a> as the <a href="Republic%20of%20Upper%20Volta">Republic of Upper Volta</a>; it joined the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories had begun with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganization measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from France was received in 1960.

The Republic of Upper Volta () was established on 11 December 1958 as a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> within the <a href="French%20Community">French Community</a>. The name "Upper Volta" related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the <a href="Volta%20River">Volta River</a>. The river's three <a href="Tributary">tributaries</a> are called the <a href="Black%20Volta">Black</a>, <a href="White%20Volta">White</a> and <a href="Red%20Volta">Red Volta</a>. These were expressed in the three colors of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Upper%20Volta">former national flag</a>.

Before attaining autonomy, it had been <a href="French%20Upper%20Volta">French Upper Volta</a> and part of the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a>. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from <a href="French%20Fourth%20Republic">France</a>. The first president, <a href="Maurice%20Yam%C3%A9ogo">Maurice Yaméogo</a>, was the leader of the <a href="Voltaic%20Democratic%20Union">Voltaic Democratic Union</a> (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a> of a president and a national assembly for five-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966. After much unrest, including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants, the military intervened.

The <a href="1966%20Upper%20Voltan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1966 military coup</a> deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. <a href="Sangoul%C3%A9%20Lamizana">Sangoulé Lamizana</a> at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years. On 14  June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the <a href="Sahel%20drought">Sahel drought and famine</a> which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries. After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977. Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. <a href="Saye%20Zerbo">Saye Zerbo</a> overthrew President Lamizana in a <a href="1980%20Upper%20Voltan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">bloodless coup</a>. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later by Maj. Dr. <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Ou%C3%A9draogo">Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo</a> and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP) in the <a href="1982%20Upper%20Voltan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état</a>. The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.

Infighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. <a href="Thomas%20Sankara">Thomas Sankara</a>, was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Blaise Compaoré</a>, resulted in a military <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> on 4 August 1983.

The coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption and anti-desertification projects.

On 4 August 1984, on President Sankara's initiative, the country's name was changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso ("land of the upright/honest people").
Sankara's government formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with Sankara as its president, and established popular <a href="Committees%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20the%20Revolution%20%28Burkina%20Faso%29">Committees for the Defense of the Revolution</a> (CDRs). The <a href="Pioneers%20of%20the%20Revolution">Pioneers of the Revolution</a> youth programme was also established.

Sankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent. His foreign policies were centred on <a href="anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a>, his government denying all <a href="foreign%20aid">foreign aid</a>, pushing for <a href="odious%20debt">odious debt</a> reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) and <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>. His domestic policies included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of <a href="female%20genital%20mutilation">female genital mutilation</a>, <a href="forced%20marriage">forced marriage</a>s and <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a>.

Sankara pushed for agrarian self-sufficiency and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>, <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>, and <a href="measles">measles</a>. His national agenda also included planting over 10,000,000 trees to halt the growing <a href="desertification">desertification</a> of the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>. Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had over 350 communities build schools with their own labour.

On 15 October 1987, Sankara, along with twelve other officials, was killed in a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> organized by <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Blaise Compaoré</a>, Sankara's former colleague and Burkina Faso's president until October 2014. After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days. A majority of Burkinabé citizens hold that France's foreign ministry, the Quai d'Orsay, was behind Compaoré in organizing the coup.

Deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries was one of the reasons given by Compaoré for the coup. Compaoré argued that Sankara had jeopardised foreign relations with the former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast (both of which supported the change in government). Following the coup Compaoré immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara's policies, returned the country back into the IMF fold, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara's legacy. Limited democratic reforms were introduced in 1990 by Compaoré. Under the new constitution, Compaoré was re-elected without opposition in 1991. In 1998 Compaoré won election in a landslide. In 2004,13 people were tried for plotting a coup against President Compaoré and the coup's alleged mastermind was sentenced to life imprisonment. , Burkina Faso remains one of the <a href="Least%20developed%20country">least developed countries</a> in the world.

Compaoré's government had played the role of negotiator in several West-African disputes including the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Ivorian%20crisis">2010–11 Ivorian crisis</a>, the Inter-Togolese Dialogue, and the <a href="2012%20Malian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">2012 Malian Crisis</a>.

Between February and April 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked <a href="2011%20Burkinab%C3%A8%20protests">protests</a> throughout the country, coupled with a military mutiny and a magistrates' strike.

Starting on 28 October 2014 protesters began to march and demonstrate in Ouagadougou against President <a href="Blaise%20Compaore">Blaise Compaore</a> who appeared ready to amend the constitution and extend his 27-year rule. On 30 October, some protesters set fire to the parliament and took over the national TV headquarters. <a href="Ouagadougou%20Airport">Ouagadougou International Airport</a> was closed and MPs suspended the vote on changing the constitution to allow Compaoré to stand for re-election in 2015. Later in the day, the military dissolved all government institutions and set a <a href="curfew">curfew</a>.

On 31 October 2014, President Compaoré, facing mounting pressure, resigned after 27 years in office. <a href="Yacouba%20Isaac%20Zida">Lt. Col. Isaac Zida</a> said that he would lead the country during its transitional period before the planned <a href="Burkinab%C3%A9%20presidential%20election%2C%202015">2015 presidential election</a> but there were concerns over his close ties to the former president. In November 2014 opposition parties, civil society groups and religious leaders adopted a plan for a transitional authority to guide Burkina Faso to elections. Under the plan <a href="Michel%20Kafando">Michel Kafando</a> was made the transitional <a href="President%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">President of Burkina Faso</a> and Lt. Col. Zida became the acting Prime Minister and Defense Minister.

In September 2015, the <a href="Regiment%20of%20Presidential%20Security">Regiment of Presidential Security</a> (RSP) seized the country's president and prime minister, and declared the <a href="National%20Council%20for%20Democracy">National Council for Democracy</a> the new national government. However, on 22 September 2015, the coup leader, <a href="Gilbert%20Diend%C3%A9r%C3%A9">Gilbert Diendéré</a>, apologized and promised to restore the civilian government. On 23 September 2015, the prime minister and interim president were restored to power.

General elections were held in Burkina Faso on 29 November 2015. <a href="Roch%20Marc%20Christian%20Kabor%C3%A9">Roch Marc Christian Kaboré</a> won the election in the first round with 53.5% of the vote, defeating businessman <a href="Z%C3%A9phirin%20Diabr%C3%A9">Zéphirin Diabré</a> who took 29.7%. Kaboré was sworn in as President on 29 December 2015.

With French help, <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Blaise Compaoré</a> seized power in a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> in 1987. He overthrew his long-time friend and ally <a href="Thomas%20Sankara">Thomas Sankara</a>, who was killed in the coup.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">constitution</a> of 2 June 1991 established a <a href="Semi-presidential%20system">semi-presidential government</a>: its parliament could be dissolved by the <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">President of the Republic</a>, who was to be <a href="Elections%20in%20Burkina%20Faso">elected</a> for a term of seven years. In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. If passed beforehand, it would have prevented Compaoré from being reelected.

Other presidential candidates challenged the election results. But in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that, because Compaoré was the sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office. This cleared the way for his candidacy in <a href="Burkina%20Faso%20presidential%20elections%2C%202005">the 2005 election</a>. On 13 November 2005, Compaoré was reelected in a landslide, because of a divided political opposition.

In the <a href="Burkinab%C3%A9%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">2010 Presidential elections</a>, President Compaoré was re-elected. Only 1.6 million Burkinabés voted, out of a total population 10 times that size.

The <a href="2011%20Burkinab%C3%A8%20protests">2011 Burkinabè protests</a> were a series of popular protests that called for the resignation of Compaoré, democratic reforms, higher wages for troops and public servants and economic freedom. As a result, Governors were replaced and wages for public servants were raised.

The <a href="parliament">parliament</a> consisted of <a href="unicameralism">one chamber</a> known as the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Burkina%20Faso%29">National Assembly</a> which had 111 seats with members elected to serve five-year terms. There was also a constitutional chamber, composed of ten members, and an economic and social council whose roles were purely consultative. The 1991 constitution created a <a href="bicameralism">bicameral</a> parliament but the upper house (Chamber of Representatives) was abolished in 2002.

The Compaoré administration had worked to <a href="Decentralization%23Government%20decentralization">decentralize power</a> by devolving some of its powers to regions and municipal authorities. But the widespread distrust of politicians and lack of political involvement by many residents complicated this process. Critics described this as a hybrid decentralisation.

<a href="Political%20freedom">Political freedom</a>s are severely restricted in Burkina Faso. <a href="Political%20freedom">Human rights organizations</a> had criticised the Compaoré administration for numerous acts of state-sponsored violence against journalists and other politically active members of society.

In mid-September 2015 the Kafando government, along with the rest of the post-October 2014 political order, was <a href="2015%20Burkinabe%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">temporarily overthrown</a> in a coup attempt by the <a href="Regiment%20of%20Presidential%20Security">Regiment of Presidential Security</a> (RSP). They installed <a href="Gilbert%20Diend%C3%A9r%C3%A9">Gilbert Diendéré</a> as chairman of the new <a href="National%20Council%20for%20Democracy">National Council for Democracy</a>. On 23 September 2015, the prime minister and interim president were restored to power. The <a href="Burkinab%C3%A9%20general%20election%2C%202015">national elections</a> were subsequently rescheduled for 29 November.

Kaboré won the election in the first round of voting, receiving 53.5% of the vote against 29.7% for the second place candidate, <a href="Zephirin%20Diabr%C3%A9">Zephirin Diabré</a>. He was sworn in as President on 29 December 2015.

Burkina Faso is a member of the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a>, <a href="Community%20of%20Sahel-Saharan%20States">Community of Sahel-Saharan States</a>, <a href="La%20Francophonie">La Francophonie</a>, <a href="Organisation%20of%20Islamic%20Cooperation">Organisation of Islamic Cooperation</a>, <a href="Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States">Economic Community of West African States</a>, and <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>.

The <a href="Army%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">army</a> consists of some 6,000 men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national People's Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35 years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties. According to "Jane’s Sentinel Country Risk Assessment", Burkina Faso's Army is undermanned for its force structure and poorly equipped, but has wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa.

In terms of training and equipment, the regular Army is believed to be neglected in relation to the élite Regiment of Presidential Security ( – RSP). Reports have emerged in recent years of disputes over pay and conditions. There is an air force with some 19 operational aircraft, but no navy, as the country is landlocked. Military expenses constitute approximately 1.2% of the nation’s GDP.

In April 2011, there was an <a href="2011%20Burkina%20Faso%20mutiny">army mutiny</a>; the president named new chiefs of staff, and a curfew was imposed in <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>.

Burkina Faso employs numerous police and security forces, generally modeled after organizations used by <a href="French%20police">French police</a>. France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces. The "Gendarmerie Nationale" is organized along military lines, with most police services delivered at the brigade level. The <a href="Gendarmerie">Gendarmerie</a> operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence, and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders.

There is a municipal police force controlled by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Territorial%20Administration">Ministry of Territorial Administration</a>; a national police force controlled by the Ministry of Security; and an autonomous <a href="Regiment%20of%20Presidential%20Security">Regiment of Presidential Security</a> ("Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle", or RSP), a ‘palace guard’ devoted to the protection of the President of the Republic. Both the gendarmerie and the national police are subdivided into both administrative and judicial police functions; the former are detailed to protect public order and provide security, the latter are charged with criminal investigations.

All foreigners and citizens are required to carry photo ID passports, or other forms of identification or risk a fine, and police spot identity checks are commonplace for persons traveling by auto, <a href="Share%20taxi">bush-taxi</a>, or bus.

Burkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes <a href="9th%20parallel%20north">9°</a> and <a href="15th%20parallel%20north">15°N</a> (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes <a href="6th%20meridian%20west">6°W</a> and <a href="3rd%20meridian%20east">3°E</a>.

It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a <a href="peneplain">peneplain</a>, which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> <a href="massif">massif</a>. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> massif, where the highest peak, Ténakourou, is found at an elevation of . The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than . Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.

The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the <a href="Black%20Volta">Black Volta</a> (or "Mouhoun"), the <a href="White%20Volta">White Volta</a> ("Nakambé") and the <a href="Red%20Volta">Red Volta</a> ("Nazinon"). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the <a href="Komo%C3%A9%20River">Komoé</a>, which flows to the southwest. The basin of the <a href="Niger%20River">Niger River</a> also <a href="drainage%20basin">drains</a> 27% of the country's surface.

The Niger's <a href="tributary">tributaries</a> – the Béli, Gorouol, Goudébo, and Dargol – are <a href="Torrent%20%28stream%29">seasonal streams</a> and flow for only four to six months a year. They still can flood and overflow, however. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, <a href="Lake%20Bam">Bam</a>, and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli, and Markoye. <a href="Drought">Water shortages</a> are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.

The country is divided into <a href="Regions%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">13 administrative regions</a>. These regions encompass <a href="Provinces%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">45 provinces</a> and <a href="Departments%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">301 departments</a>. Each region is administered by a <a href="Governor">Governor</a>.

Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between of rainfall; in the dry season, the <a href="harmattan">harmattan</a> – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June through September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> in the north typically receives less than of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, .

A relatively dry <a href="tropical%20savanna">tropical savanna</a>, the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a> to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> to its north and the fertile region of the <a href="Sudan%20%28region%29">Sudan</a> to the South. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north <a href="latitude">latitude</a>, the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.

Burkina Faso's natural resources include <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, <a href="marble">marble</a>, <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>s, <a href="pumice">pumice</a>, and <a href="Salt%20mining">salt</a>.

Burkina Faso has a larger number of elephants than many countries in West Africa. Lions, leopards and buffalo can also be found here, including the dwarf or red buffalo, a smaller reddish-brown animal which looks like a fierce kind of short-legged cow. Other large predators live in Burkina Faso, such as the cheetah, the caracal or African lynx, the spotted hyena and the African wild dog, one of the continent’s most endangered species.

Burkina Faso's <a href="Wildlife%20in%20Burkina%20Faso">fauna and flora</a> are protected in four national parks:

and several reserves: see <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20in%20Africa">List of national parks in Africa</a> and <a href="Nature%20reserves%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">Nature reserves of Burkina Faso</a>.

The value of Burkina Faso's exports fell from $2.77 billion in 2011 to $754 million in 2012. Agriculture represents 32% of its gross domestic product and occupies 80% of the working population. It consists mostly of rearing livestock. Especially in the south and southwest, the people grow crops of <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="pearl%20millet">pearl millet</a>, <a href="maize">maize (corn)</a>, <a href="peanut">peanut</a>s, rice and cotton, with surpluses to be sold. A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid.

Burkina Faso was ranked the 111th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings. <a href="Remittance">Remittance</a>s used to be an important source of income to Burkina Faso until the 1990s, when unrest in <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, the main destination for Burkinabe emigrants, forced many to return home. Remittances now account for less than 1% of GDP.

Burkina Faso is part of the <a href="West%20African%20Monetary%20and%20Economic%20Union">West African Monetary and Economic Union</a> (UMEOA) and has adopted the <a href="West%20African%20CFA%20franc">CFA franc</a>. This is issued by the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20the%20West%20African%20States">Central Bank of the West African States</a> (BCEAO), situated in <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, Senegal. The BCEAO manages the monetary and reserve policy of the member states, and provides regulation and oversight of financial sector and banking activity. A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place, having been reformed significantly in 1999. <a href="Microfinance">Microfinance</a> institutions are governed by a separate law, which regulates microfinance activities in all WAEMU countries. The insurance sector is regulated through the Inter-African Conference on Insurance Markets (CIMA).
There is mining of copper, iron, <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, gold, <a href="cassiterite">cassiterite</a> (tin ore), and phosphates. These operations provide employment and generate international aid. Gold production increased 32% in 2011 at six gold mine sites, making Burkina Faso the fourth-largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa, Mali and Ghana.

Burkina Faso also hosts the International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou. It is better known by its French name as <a href="SIAO">SIAO</a>, "Le Salon International de l' Artisanat de Ouagadougou", and is one of the most important African handicraft fairs.

Burkina Faso is a member of the <a href="Organization%20for%20the%20Harmonization%20of%20Business%20Law%20in%20Africa">Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa</a> (OHADA).
While <a href="Tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">services</a> remain underdeveloped, the National Office for Water and Sanitation (ONEA), a <a href="state-owned">state-owned</a> <a href="utility%20company">utility company</a> run along commercial lines, is emerging as one of the best-performing utility companies in Africa. High levels of autonomy and a skilled and dedicated management have driven ONEA's ability to improve production of and access to clean water.

Since 2000, nearly 2 million more people have access to water in the four principal urban centres in the country; the company has kept the quality of <a href="Water%20infrastructure">infrastructure</a> high (less than 18% of the water is lost through leaks – one of the lowest in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>), improved financial reporting, and increased its annual revenue by an average of 12% (well above inflation). Challenges remain, including difficulties among some customers in paying for services, with the need to rely on international aid to expand its infrastructure. The state-owned, commercially run venture has helped the nation reach its <a href="Millennium%20Development%20Goal">Millennium Development Goal</a> (MDG) targets in water-related areas, and has grown as a viable company.

The growth rate in Burkina Faso is high although it continues to be plagued by corruption and incursions from terrorist groups from Mali and Niger.

Transport in Burkina Faso is hampered by a largely underdeveloped infrastructure.

The main airport is at <a href="Ouagadougou%20Airport">Ouagadougou</a> and as of June 2014 it had regularly scheduled flights to many destinations in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a> as well as <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> and <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. There is another international airport at <a href="Bobo%20Dioulasso%20Airport">Bobo Dioulasso</a> which has flights to Ouagadougou and <a href="Port%20Bouet%20Airport">Abidjan</a>.

<a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20Burkina%20Faso">Rail transport in Burkina Faso</a> consists of a single line which runs from <a href="Kaya%2C%20Burkina%20Faso">Kaya</a> to <a href="Abidjan">Abidjan</a> in <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a> via <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>, <a href="Koudougou">Koudougou</a>, <a href="Bobo%20Dioulasso">Bobo Dioulasso</a> and <a href="Banfora">Banfora</a>. "Sitarail" operates a passenger train three times a week along the route.

There are 12,506 kilometres of <a href="highway">highway</a> in Burkina Faso, of which 2,001 kilometres are paved.

In 2009, Burkina Faso spent 0.20% of GDP on research and development (R&D), one of the lowest ratios in West Africa. There were 48 researchers (in full-time equivalents) per million inahbitants in 2010, which is more than twice the average for sub-Saharan Africa (20 per million population in 2013) and higher than the ratio for Ghana and Nigeria (39). It is, however, much lower than the ratio for Senegal (361 per million inhabitants). In Burkina Faso in 2010, 46% of researchers were working in the health sector, 16% in engineering, 13% in natural sciences, 9% in agricultural sciences, 7% in the humanities and 4% in social sciences.

In January 2011, the government created the Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation. Up until then, management of science, technology and innovation had fallen under the Department of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research. Within this ministry, the Directorate General for Research and Sector Statistics is responsible for planning. A separate body, the Directorate General of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation, co-ordinates research. This is a departure from the pattern in many other West African countries where a single body fulfils both functions. The move signals the government's intention to make science and technology a development priority.

In 2012, Burkina Faso adopted a "National Policy for Scientific and Technical Research", the strategic objectives of which are to develop R&D and the application and commercialization of research results. The policy also makes provisions for strengthening the ministry’s strategic and operational capacities. One of the key priorities is to improve food security and self-sufficiency by boosting capacity in agricultural and environmental sciences. The creation of a centre of excellence in 2014 at the International Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering in Ouagadougou within the World Bank project provides essential funding for capacity-building in these priority areas.

A dual priority is to promote innovative, effective and accessible health systems. The government wishes to develop, in parallel, applied sciences and technology and social and human sciences. To complement the national research policy, the government has prepared a "National Strategy to Popularize Technologies, Inventions and Innovations" (2012) and a "National Innovation Strategy" (2014). Other policies also incorporate science and technology, such as that on "Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research" (2010), the "National Policy on Food and Nutrition Security" (2014) and the "National Programme for the Rural Sector" (2011).

In 2013, Burkina Faso passed the Science, Technology and Innovation Act establishing three mechanisms for financing research and innovation, a clear indication of high-level commitment. These mechanisms are the National Fund for Education and Research, the National Fund for Research and Innovation for Development and the Forum of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation.

Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state. Most of Burkina's people are concentrated in the south and center of the country, where their density sometimes exceeds 48 persons per square kilometer (125/sq. mi.). Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe migrate regularly to Ivory Coast and Ghana, mainly for seasonal agricultural work. These flows of workers are affected by external events; the September 2002 coup attempt in Ivory Coast and the ensuing fighting meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe returned to Burkina Faso. The regional economy suffered when they were unable to work.

The <a href="total%20fertility%20rate">total fertility rate</a> of Burkina Faso is 5.93 children born per woman (2014 estimates), the sixth highest in the world.

In 2009 the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. Department of State</a>'s "Trafficking in Persons Report" reported that <a href="Slavery%20in%20modern%20Africa">slavery</a> in Burkina Faso continued to exist and that Burkinabè children were often the victims. Slavery in the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> states in general, is an entrenched institution with a long history that dates back to the <a href="Arab%20slave%20trade">Arab slave trade</a>.

Burkina Faso's 17.3 million people belong to two major West African ethnic cultural groups—the <a href="Gur%20languages">Voltaic</a> and the <a href="Mand%C3%A9%20peoples">Mande</a> (whose common language is <a href="Dioula%20language">Dioula</a>). The Voltaic <a href="Mossi%20people">Mossi</a> make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso from northern Ghana around 1100 AD. They established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is led by the "<a href="Mogho%20Naba">Mogho Naba</a>," whose court is in Ouagadougou.

Burkina Faso is a <a href="multilingual">multilingual</a> country. An estimated 69 languages are spoken there, of which about 60 languages are <a href="indigenous%20language">indigenous</a>. The <a href="Mossi%20language">Mossi language</a> () is spoken by about 40% of the population, mainly in the central region around the capital, Ouagadougou, along with other, closely related <a href="Gurunsi%20languages">Gurunsi languages</a> scattered throughout Burkina.

In the west, <a href="Mande%20languages">Mande languages</a> are widely spoken, the most predominant being <a href="Dyula%20language">Dyula</a> (also known as Jula or Dioula), others including <a href="Bobo%20language">Bobo</a>, <a href="Samo%20language%20%28Burkina%29">Samo</a>, and <a href="Marka%20language">Marka</a>. The <a href="Fula%20language">Fula language</a> (, ) is widespread, particularly in the north. The <a href="Gourmanch%C3%A9%20language">Gourmanché language</a> is spoken in the east, while the <a href="Bissa%20language">Bissa language</a> is spoken in the south.

The <a href="official%20language">official language</a> is <a href="French%20language">French</a>, which was introduced during the colonial period. French is the principal language of administrative, political and judicial institutions, public services, and the press. It is the only language for laws, administration and courts.

Statistics on religion in Burkina Faso are inexact because <a href="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> are often practiced in tandem with indigenous religious beliefs. The <a href="Government%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">Government of Burkina Faso</a> 2006 census reported that 60.5% of the population practice Islam, and that the majority of this group belong to the <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> branch, while a small minority adheres to <a href="Shia">Shia</a> Islam. There are also large concentrations of the <a href="Ahmadiyya">Ahmadiyya</a> Muslims.

A significant number of Sunni Muslims identify with the <a href="Tijaniyah">Tijaniyah</a> <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> order. The government estimated that 23.2% of the population are Christians (19% being Roman Catholics and 4.2% members of Protestant denominations); 15.3% follow <a href="African%20traditional%20religion">traditional indigenous beliefs</a>, 0.6% have other religions, and 0.4% have none.

In 2012, the average life expectancy was estimated at 57 for male and 59 for female. The under five mortality rate and the infant mortality rate were respectively 102 and 66 per 1000 live births. In 2014, the median age of its inhabitants is 17 and the estimated population growth rate is 3.05%.

In 2011, health expenditures was 6.5% of GDP; the maternal mortality ratio was estimated at 300 deaths per 100000 live births and the physician density at 0.05 per 1000 population in 2010. In 2012, it was estimated that the adult <a href="HIV">HIV</a> <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> rate (ages 15–49) was 1.0%. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, HIV prevalence is declining among pregnant women who attend antenatal clinics. According to a 2005 World Health Organization report, an estimated 72.5% of Burkina Faso's girls and women have had <a href="female%20genital%20mutilation">female genital mutilation</a>, administered according to traditional rituals.

Central government spending on health was 3% in 2001. , studies estimated there were as few as 10 physicians per 100,000 people. In addition, there were 41 nurses and 13 midwives per 100,000 people. <a href="Demographic%20and%20Health%20Surveys">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> has completed three surveys in Burkina Faso since 1993, and had another in 2009.

A recent Dengue fever outbreak in 2016 have killed 20 patients. Cases of the disease have been reported from all 12 districts of Ouagadougou.

Education in Burkina Faso is divided into primary, secondary and higher education. High school costs approximately CFA 25,000 ($50 USD) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts. An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.

To proceed from elementary to middle school, middle to high school or high school to college, national exams must be passed. Institutions of higher education include the <a href="University%20of%20Ouagadougou">University of Ouagadougou</a>, <a href="The%20Polytechnic%20University%20of%20Bobo-Dioulasso">The Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Koudougou">University of Koudougou</a>, which is also a teacher training institution. There are some small private colleges in the capital city of <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a> but these are affordable to only a small portion of the population.

There is also the <a href="International%20School%20of%20Ouagadougou">International School of Ouagadougou</a> (ISO), an American-based private school located in Ouagadougou.

The 2008 UN Development Program Report ranked Burkina Faso as the country with the lowest level of literacy in the world, despite a concerted effort to double its literacy rate from 12.8% in 1990 to 25.3% in 2008.

<a href="Literature%20in%20Burkina%20Faso">Literature in Burkina Faso</a> is based on the <a href="oral%20tradition">oral tradition</a>, which remains important. In 1934, during French occupation, Dim-Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his "Maximes, pensées et devinettes mossi" ("Maximes, Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi"), a record of the oral history of the <a href="Mossi%20people">Mossi people</a>.

The oral tradition continued to have an influence on Burkinabè writers in the post-independence Burkina Faso of the 1960s, such as <a href="Nazi%20Boni">Nazi Boni</a> and Roger Nikiema. The 1960s saw a growth in the number of playwrights being published. Since the 1970s, literature has developed in Burkina Faso with many more writers being published.

The <a href="theatre%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">theatre of Burkina Faso</a> combines traditional Burkinabè performance with the colonial influences and post-colonial efforts to educate rural people to produce a distinctive national theatre. Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with <a href="mask">mask</a>s. Western-style theatre became common during colonial times, heavily influenced by <a href="French%20theatre">French theatre</a>. With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by <a href="Theatre%20of%20the%20Oppressed">forum theatre</a> aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Faso's rural people.

In addition to several rich traditional artistic heritages among the peoples, there is a large artist community in Burkina Faso, especially in <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>. Much of the crafts produced are for the growing tourist industry.

Typical of West African cuisine, Burkina Faso's cuisine is based on <a href="staple%20food">staple food</a>s of <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="millet">millet</a>, rice, maize, <a href="peanut">peanut</a>s, potatoes, <a href="bean">bean</a>s, <a href="yam%20%28vegetable%29">yam</a>s and <a href="okra">okra</a>. . The most common sources of animal protein are chicken, chicken eggs and fresh water fish. A typical Burkinabè beverage is Banji or Palm Wine, which is fermented <a href="Palm%20wine">palm sap</a>; and Zoom kom, or "grain water" purportedly the national drink of Burkina Faso. Zoom-kom is milky-looking and whitish, having a water and cereal base, best drunk with ice cubes. In the more rural regions, in the outskirts of Burkina, you would find Dolo, which is drink made from fermented millet.

The <a href="cinema%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">cinema of Burkina Faso</a> is an important part of West African and African film industry. Burkina's contribution to <a href="African%20cinema">African cinema</a> started with the establishment of the film festival <a href="FESPACO">FESPACO</a> (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969. Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes.

For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Sankara. (In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa, but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagadougou.) Among the best known directors from Burkina Faso are <a href="Gaston%20Kabor%C3%A9">Gaston Kaboré</a>, <a href="Idrissa%20Ouedraogo">Idrissa Ouedraogo</a> and <a href="Dani%20Kouyate">Dani Kouyate</a>. Burkina produces popular television series such as "Les Bobodiouf". The internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate make popular television series.

Sport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football (soccer), basketball, cycling, Rugby union, handball, tennis, boxing and martial arts. Football is very popular in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country. The national team is nicknamed "Les Etalons" ("the Stallions") in reference to the legendary horse of Princess <a href="Yennenga">Yennenga</a>.

In 1998, Burkina Faso hosted the <a href="Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations">Africa Cup of Nations</a> for which the Omnisport Stadium in Bobo-Dioulasso was built. In 2013, Burkina Faso qualified for the African Cup of Nations in South Africa, reached the final, but then lost to Nigeria by the score of 0 to 1. The country is currently ranked 53rd in the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Rankings">FIFA World Rankings</a>.

Basketball is another sport which enjoys much popularity for both men and women. The country's <a href="Burkina%20Faso%20national%20basketball%20team">national team</a> had its most successful year in 2013 when it qualified for the <a href="AfroBasket">AfroBasket</a>, the continent's prime basketball event.

The nation's principal media outlet is its state-sponsored combined television and radio service, "Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina" (RTB). "RTB" broadcasts on two <a href="medium-wave">medium-wave</a> (<a href="Amplitude%20modulation">AM</a>) and several <a href="Frequency%20modulation">FM</a> frequencies. Besides RTB, there are privately owned sports, cultural, music, and religious FM radio stations. "RTB" maintains a worldwide short-wave news broadcast ("Radio Nationale Burkina") in the French language from the capital at Ouagadougou using a 100 kW transmitter on 4.815 and 5.030 MHz.

Attempts to develop an independent press and media in Burkina Faso have been intermittent. In 1998, investigative journalist <a href="Norbert%20Zongo">Norbert Zongo</a>, his brother Ernest, his driver, and another man were assassinated by unknown assailants, and the bodies burned. The crime was never solved. However, an independent Commission of Inquiry later concluded that Norbert Zongo was killed for political reasons because of his investigative work into the death of David Ouedraogo, a chauffeur who worked for François Compaoré, President Blaise Compaoré's brother.

In January 1999, François Compaoré was charged with the murder of David Ouedraogo, who had died as a result of torture in January 1998. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after an appeal. In August 2000, five members of the President's personal security guard detail ("Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle", or RSP) were charged with the murder of Ouedraogo. RSP members Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama, and Ousseini Yaro, investigated as suspects in the Norbert Zongo assassination, were convicted in the Ouedraogo case and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.

Since the death of Norbert Zongo, several protests regarding the Zongo investigation and treatment of journalists have been prevented or dispersed by government police and security forces. In April 2007, popular radio reggae host <a href="Sams%E2%80%99K%20Le%20Jah">Karim Sama</a>, whose programs feature reggae songs interspersed with critical commentary on alleged government injustice and corruption, received several death threats.

Sama's personal car was later burned outside the private radio station "Ouaga FM" by unknown vandals. In response, the <a href="Committee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) wrote to President Compaoré to request his government investigate the sending of e-mailed death threats to journalists and radio commentators in Burkina Faso who were critical of the government. In December 2008, police in Ouagadougou questioned leaders of a protest march that called for a renewed investigation into the unsolved Zongo assassination. Among the marchers was Jean-Claude Meda, the president of the Association of Journalists of Burkina Faso.

Every two years, Ouagadougou hosts the <a href="Panafrican%20Film%20and%20Television%20Festival%20of%20Ouagadougou">Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou</a> (FESPACO), the largest African cinema festival on the continent(February, odd years).

Held every two years since 1988, the <a href="International%20Art%20and%20Craft%20Fair%2C%20Ouagadougou">International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou</a> (SIAO), is one of Africa's most important trade shows for art and handicrafts (late October-early November, even years).

Also every two years, the <a href="Symposium%20de%20sculpture%20sur%20granit%20de%20Laongo">Symposium de sculpture sur granit de Laongo</a> takes place on a site located about from <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>, in the province of <a href="Oubritenga">Oubritenga</a>.

The <a href="National%20Culture%20Week%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">National Culture Week of Burkina Faso</a>, better known by its French name La Semaine Nationale de la culture (SNC), is one of the most important cultural activities of Burkina Faso. It is a biennial event which takes place every two years in <a href="Bobo%20Dioulasso">Bobo Dioulasso</a>, the second-largest city in the country.

Burkina Faso is faced with high levels of <a href="food%20insecurity">food insecurity</a>. As defined by the 1996 <a href="World%20Food%20Summit">World Food Summit</a>, "food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy lifestyle." There has not been much successful improvement on this issue of food security within recent years. Burkina Faso's rapidly growing population (around 3.6% annually) continues to put a strain on the country's resources and infrastructure, which can further limit accessibility to food. Because the country is landlocked and prone to <a href="Natural%20disaster">Natural disaster</a>s, including drought and floods, many families struggle to protect themselves from severe <a href="hunger">hunger</a>. While recent harvest productions have improved some, much of the population is still having a hard time overcoming the continuous food and nutrition crises of the past decade. <a href="Malnutrition">Malnutrition</a> is especially common in women and children, with large amounts of the population suffering from <a href="stunted%20growth">stunted growth</a> and <a href="micronutrient%20deficiencies">micronutrient deficiencies</a> such as <a href="anemia">anemia</a>. Food insecurity has grown to be a structural problem in Burkina Faso, only to be intensified by high food prices. All of these factors combined with high poverty levels have left Burkina Faso vulnerable to chronic high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition.

<a href="Poverty">Poverty</a> continues to be strongly linked to food insecurity. As one of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina Faso has around 44.5% of its population living under the <a href="Poverty%20Line">poverty line</a> and ranked 183 out of 187 countries on the <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">UNDP</a> Human Development Index in 2014. The Human Development Index is a measure of quality of life, taking into account three main areas of human development: longevity, education, and economic standard of living. These high levels of poverty found in Burkina Faso, combined with the soaring food prices of the <a href="global%20food%20crisis">global food crisis</a> continue to contribute to Burkina Faso's issue of food insecurity. The global food crisis of 2007–2008 was a drastic surge in food prices that lead to high rates of hunger, malnutrition, and political and economic instability in nations across the globe. This strongly affected Burkina Faso because around 80% of Burkina's population is <a href="Rural%20area">rural</a>, relying on <a href="subsistence%20farming">subsistence farming</a> to make a living. For instance, when natural disasters such as floods, droughts, or locust attacks occur and cause crops to fail, farmers in Burkina Faso become dependent on grain purchases. Because of the global food crisis, local grain prices dramatically increased, limiting farmers' access to grain through market exchanges.

Geographic and environmental causes can also play a significant role in contributing to Burkina Faso's issue of food insecurity. As the country is situated in the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> region, Burkina Faso experiences some of the most radical climatic variation in the world, ranging from severe flooding to extreme drought. The unpredictable climatic shock that Burkina Faso citizens often face results in strong difficulties in being able to rely on and accumulate wealth through agricultural means. Burkina Faso's climate also renders its crops vulnerable to insect attacks, including attacks from <a href="locust">locust</a>s and <a href="Cricket%20%28insect%29">crickets</a>, which destroy crops and further inhibit food production. Not only is most of the population of Burkina Faso dependent on agriculture as a source of income, but they also rely on the agricultural sector for food that will directly feed the household. Due to the vulnerability of agriculture, more and more families are having to look for other sources of non-farm income, and oftentimes have to travel outside of their regional zone to find work.

According to the <a href="Global%20Hunger%20Index">Global Hunger Index</a>, a multidimensional tool used to measure and track a country's hunger levels, Burkina Faso ranked 65 out of 78 countries in 2013. It is estimated that there are currently over 1.5 million children who are at risk of food insecurity in Burkina Faso, with around 350,000 children who are in need of emergency medical assistance. However, only about a third of these children will actually receive adequate medical attention. Only 11.4 percent of children under the age of two receive the daily recommended number of meals. Stunted growth as a result of food insecurity is a severe problem in Burkina Faso, affecting at least a third of the population from 2008 to 2012. Additionally, stunted children, on average, tend to complete less school than children with normal growth development, further contributing to the low levels of education of the Burkina Faso population.

The <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> expects that approximately 500,000 children under age 5 in Burkina Faso will suffer from acute malnutrition in 2015, including around 149,000 who will suffer from its most life-threatening form. Rates of micronutrient deficiencies are also high. According to the <a href="Demographic%20and%20Health%20Surveys">Demographic and Health Survey</a> (DHS 2010), 49 percent of women and 88 percent of children under the age of five suffer from anemia. Forty percent of infant deaths can be attributed to malnutrition, and in turn, these infant mortality rates have decreased Burkina Faso's total work force by 13.6 percent, demonstrating how food security affects more aspects of life beyond health.

These high rates of food insecurity and the accompanying effects are even more prevalent in rural populations compared to urban ones, as access to health services in rural areas is much more limited and awareness and education of children's nutritional needs is lower.

The <a href="World%20Food%20Programme">World Food Programme</a> has several projects it is working on that are geared towards increasing food security in Burkina Faso.
The Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation 200509 (PRRO) was formed to respond to the high levels of malnutrition in Burkina Faso, following the food and nutrition crisis in 2012. The efforts of this project are mostly geared towards the treatment and prevention of malnutrition and include take home rations for the caretakers of those children who are being treated for malnutrition. Additionally, the activities of this operation contribute to families' abilities to withstand future food crises. Better nutrition among the two most vulnerable groups, young children and pregnant women, prepares them to be able to respond better in times when food security is compromised, such as in droughts.

The Country Programme (CP) has two parts: food and nutritional assistance to people with <a href="HIV">HIV</a>/AIDS, and a school feeding program for all primary schools in the Sahel region. The HIV/AIDS nutrition program aims to better the nutritional recovery of those who are living with HIV/AIDS and to protect at-risk children and orphans from malnutrition and food security. As part of the school feeding component, the Country Programme's goals are to increase enrollment and attendance in schools in the Sahel region, where enrollment rates are below the national average. Furthermore, the program aims at improving gender parity rates in these schools, by providing girls with high attendance in the last two years of primary school with take-home rations of cereals as an incentive to households, encouraging them to send their girls to school.

The <a href="World%20Bank%20Group">World Bank</a> was established in 1944, and comprises five institutions whose shared goals are to end extreme poverty by 2030 and to promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the lower forty percent of every country. One of the main projects the World Bank is working on to reduce food insecurity in Burkina Faso is the Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project. According to the World Bank, the objective of this project is to "improve the capacity of poor producers to increase food production and to ensure improved availability of food products in rural markets." The Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project has three main parts. Its first component is to work towards the improvement of food production, including financing grants and providing 'voucher for work' programs for households who cannot pay their contribution in cash. The project's next component involves improving the ability of food products, particularly in rural areas. This includes supporting the marketing of food products, and aims to strengthen the capabilities of stakeholders to control the variability of food products and supplies at local and national levels. Lastly, the third component of this project focuses on institutional development and capacity building. Its goal is to reinforce the capacities of service providers and institutions who are specifically involved in project implementation. The project's activities aim to build capacities of service providers, strengthen the capacity of food producer organizations, strengthen agricultural input supply delivery methods, and manage and evaluate project activities.

Economy of the Bahamas

The <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> is a stable, developing nation with an economy heavily dependent on <a href="tourism">tourism</a> and <a href="offshore%20banking">offshore banking</a>. Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences had led to solid GDP growth for many years, but the slowdown in the US economy and the attacks of September 11, 2001 held back growth in these sectors in 2001-03. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for about 15% of GDP. However, since December 2000, when the government enacted new regulations on the financial sector, many international businesses have left The Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on growth in the US, the source of more than 80% of the visitors. In addition to tourism and banking, the government supports the development of a "2nd-pillar", e-commerce.

The Bahamian economy is almost entirely dependent on tourism and financial services to generate foreign exchange earnings. Tourism alone provides an estimated 45% of the <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP) and employs about half the Bahamian workforce. In 2016, over 3 million tourists visited The Bahamas, most of whom are from the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>

A major contribution to the recent growth in the overall Bahamian economy is Kerzner International's Atlantis Resort and Casino, which took over the former Paradise Island Resort and has provided a much needed boost to the economy. In addition, the opening of Breezes Super Club and Sandals Resort also aided this turnaround. The Bahamian Government also has adopted a proactive approach to courting foreign investors and has conducted major investment missions to the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. The primary purpose of the trips was to restore the reputation of The Bahamas in these markets.

Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for up to 17% of GDP, due to the country's status as an offshore financial center. As of December 1998, the government had licensed 418 banks and trust companies in The Bahamas. The Bahamas promulgated the International Business Companies (IBC) Act in January 1990 to enhance the country's status as a leading financial center. The act served to simplify and reduce the cost of incorporating offshore companies in The Bahamas. Within 9 years, more than 84,000 <a href="International%20Business%20Company">IBC</a>-type companies had been established. In February 1991, the government also legalized the establishment of <a href="Asset-protection%20trust">Asset Protection Trusts</a> in The Bahamas. In December 2000, partly as a response to appearing the plenary <a href="FATF%20Blacklist">FATF Blacklist</a>, the government enacted a legislative package to better regulate the financial sector, including creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit and enforcement of "<a href="Know%20your%20customer">know-your-customer</a>" rules. Other initiatives include the enactment of the Foundations Act in 2004 and the planned introduction of legislation to regulate <a href="Trust%20company">Private Trust Companies</a>.

<a href="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> and fisheries industry together account for 5% of GDP. The Bahamas exports lobster and some fish but does not raise these items commercially. There is no largescale agriculture, and most agricultural products are consumed domestically. The Bahamas imports more than $250 million in foodstuffs per year, representing about 80% of its food consumption. The government aims to expand food production to reduce imports and generate foreign exchange. It actively seeks foreign investment aimed at increasing agricultural exports, particularly specialty food items. The government officially lists beef and pork production and processing, fruits and nuts, dairy production, winter vegetables, and mariculture (shrimp farming) as the areas in which it wishes to encourage foreign investment.

The Bahamian Government maintains the value of the <a href="Bahamian%20dollar">Bahamian dollar</a> on a par with the <a href="U.S.%20dollar">U.S. dollar</a>. The Bahamas is a beneficiary of the U.S.-<a href="Caribbean%20Basin%20Trade%20Partnership%20Act">Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act</a> (CBTPA), Canada's <a href="CARIBCAN">CARIBCAN</a> program, and the European Union's Lome IV Agreement. Although the Bahamas participates in the political aspects of the <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> (CARICOM), it has not entered into joint economic initiatives with other Caribbean states.

The Bahamas has a few notable industrial firms: the Freeport pharmaceutical firm, PharmaChem Technologies (GrandBahama) Ltd. (formerly Syntex); the BORCO oil facility, also in Freeport, which transships oil in the region; the <a href="Commonwealth%20Brewery">Commonwealth Brewery</a> in <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>, which produces <a href="Heineken%20Pilsener">Heineken</a>, <a href="Guinness">Guinness</a>, and <a href="Kalik">Kalik</a> beers; and <a href="Bacardi">Bacardi Corp.</a>, which distills rum in Nassau for shipment to the U.S. and European markets. Other industries include sun-dried sea salt in Great Inagua, a wet dock facility in Freeport for repair of cruise ships, and mining of aragonite—a type of limestone with several industrial uses—from the sea floor at Ocean Cay. Other smaller but more nimble players in the banking industry include Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) Ltd. (FBB) and Royal Fidelity Merchant Bank & Trust Limited (RFMBT). FBB offers a wide range of innovative banking products including loan products with built-in savings plans. RFMBT is the only merchant bank in The Bahamas and is a joint venture with Royal Bank of Canada. It provides investment products and services and attracts the majority of the corporate business deals in The Bahamas, most recently acting as financial advisor and placement agent for the largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) ever in The Bahamas with the IPO of Commonwealth Brewery, a Heineken subsidiary.

The Hawksbill Creek Agreement established a duty-free zone in Freeport, The Bahamas' second-largest city, with a nearby industrial park to encourage foreign industrial investment. The <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>-based firm, <a href="Hutchison%20Whampoa">Hutchison Whampoa</a>, has opened a container port in Freeport. The Bahamian Parliament approved legislation in 1993 that extended most Freeport tax and duty exemptions through 2054.

The Bahamas is largely an <a href="International%20trade">import</a>, <a href="service%20economy">service economy</a>. There are about 110 U.S.-affiliated businesses operating in The Bahamas, and most are associated with <a href="tourism">tourism</a> and <a href="banking">banking</a>. With few domestic resources and little industry, The Bahamas imports nearly all its food and manufactured goods from the United States. American goods and services tend to be favored by Bahamians due to cultural similarities and heavy exposure to American advertising.

The country's infrastructure is best developed in the principal cities of Nassau and Freeport, where there are relatively good paved roads and international airports. Electricity is generally reliable, although many businesses have their own backup generators. In Nassau, there are two daily newspapers, three weeklies, and several international newspapers available for sale. There also are eight radio stations. Both Nassau and Freeport have a television station. Cable TV also is available locally and provides most American programs with some Canadian and European channels.

The Bahamas have no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer. In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%. A value-added tax (VAT-7.5%) was instituted effective 1 January 2015.

The best U.S. export opportunities remain in the traditional areas of foodstuffs and manufactured goods: vehicles and <a href="automobile%20parts">automobile parts</a>; <a href="hotel">hotel</a>, <a href="restaurant">restaurant</a>, and <a href="medical">medical</a> supplies; and <a href="computer">computer</a>s and electronics. Bahamian tastes in consumer products roughly parallel those in the U.S. With approximately 85% of the population of primarily <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20of%20Africa">African</a> descent, there is a large and growing market in the Bahamas for personal care products. Merchants in southern <a href="Florida">Florida</a> have found it profitable to advertise in Bahamian publications. Most imports in this sector are subject to high but nondiscriminatory tariffs.


The Bahamas has the 47th freest economy in the world according to <a href="The%20Heritage%20Foundation">The Heritage Foundation</a> 2010 "<a href="Index%20of%20Economic%20Freedom">Index of Economic Freedom</a>". The Bahamas is ranked 7th out of 29 countries in the South and Central America/Caribbean region, and its overall score is higher than the regional and world averages. Total government spending, including consumption and transfer payments, is relatively low. In the most recent year, government spending equaled 23.4 percent of GDP.

Executive authority is vested in the monarch, who normally acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who are collectively responsible to Parliament. Barbadian law is rooted in <a href="English%20law">English common law</a>, and the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Barbados">Constitution of Barbados</a> implemented in 1966, is the supreme <a href="law%20of%20the%20land">law of the land</a>.

Barbados PM Freundel Stuart announced that Barbados would become a republic before the 50th anniversary of independence in 2016. Barbados will replace the Governor General as head of state with a ceremonial president. However Barbados will still retain association with the crown through membership within the Commonwealth of Nations.

Fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual are set out in the Constitution and are protected by a strict legal code.

The <a href="Cabinet%20%28Barbados%29">Cabinet</a> is headed by the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Barbados">Prime Minister</a>, who must be an elected member of Parliament, and other ministers are appointed from either chamber by the Governor-General, as advised by the Prime Minister.

The Governor-General appoints as Leader of the Opposition the member of House of Assembly who commands the support of the largest number of members of that House in opposition to the ruling party's government.

The maximum duration of a Parliament is five years from the first sitting. There is a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses of Parliament by the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.

There is an established non-political <a href="civil%20service">civil service</a>. Also, there are separate constitutional commissions for the Judicial and Legal Service, the Public Service, and the Police Service.

The government has been chosen by elections since <a href="Barbadian%20general%20election%2C%201961">1961 elections</a>, when Barbados achieved full <a href="Self-governing%20colony">self-governance</a>. Before then, the government was a <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a> consisting of either colonial administration solely (such as the <a href="Executive%20Council%20%28Commonwealth%20countries%29">Executive Council</a>), or a mixture of colonial rule and a partially elected assembly, such as the <a href="Legislative%20Council%20of%20Barbados">Legislative Council</a>. 

Since independence the <a href="Barbados%20Labour%20Party">Barbados Labour Party</a> (BLP) governed from 1976 to 1986, and from September 1994 – 2008. The <a href="Democratic%20Labour%20Party%20%28Barbados%29">Democratic Labour Party</a> (DLP) held office 1966 to 1976, from 1986 to 1994, and has formed the Government January 2008 to present.

The Executive Branch of government conducts the ordinary business of government. These functions are called out by the Prime Minister or president and cabinet ministers. The prime minister chooses the ministers of government they wish to have in the cabinet but they are actually appointed by the governor general.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Barbados">Constitution of Barbados</a> is the supreme law of the nation. The Attorney General heads the independent <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a>. Historically, Barbadian law was based entirely on <a href="English%20common%20law">English common law</a> with a few local adaptations. At the time of independence, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> lost its ability to legislate for Barbados, but the existing English and British common law and statutes in force at that time, together with other measures already adopted by the <a href="Barbadian%20Parliament">Barbadian Parliament</a>, became the basis of the new country's legal system.

Legislation may be shaped or influenced by such organisations as the United Nations, the <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a>, or other international bodies to which Barbados has obligatory commitments by treaty. Additionally, through international co-operation, other institutions may supply the Barbados Parliament with key sample legislation to be adapted to meet local circumstances before enacting it as local law.

New acts are passed by the Barbadian Parliament and require <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> by the Governor-General to become law.

The Judiciary is the legal system through which punishments are handed out to individuals who break the law. The Judiciary also settles disputes.

In 2006 it was announced that Belarus and Russia completed the second broadband link between the two countries, the <a href="Yartsevo">Yartsevo</a>-<a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a> cable. The capacity of this high speed terrestrial link which based on DWDM and STM technology is 400Gbit/s with the ability to upgrade in the future.

Belarus has 3 GSM/UMTS operators - Velcom, MTS, life. For 4G data operators use the infrastructure managed by state operator beCloud , VoLTE service currently is not offered.


Belarus has switched from an analog to digital broadcast television. The process finished in May 2015. Belarus broadcasts according to the <a href="DVB-T2">DVB-T2</a> standard with <a href="MPEG-4">MPEG-4</a> compression.



The state telecom monopoly, Beltelecom, holds the exclusive interconnection with Internet providers outside of Belarus. Beltelecom owns all the backbone channels that linked to the Lattelecom, TEO LT, <a href="Tata%20Communications">Tata Communications</a> (former <a href="Teleglobe">Teleglobe</a>), Synterra, <a href="Rostelecom">Rostelecom</a>, Transtelekom and MTS ISP's. Beltelecom is the only operator licensed to provide commercial VoIP services in Belarus.

Until 2005-2006 broadband access (mostly using <a href="ADSL">ADSL</a>) was available only in a few major cities in Belarus. In <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a> there were a dozen privately owned ISP's and in some larger cities Beltelecom's broadband was available. Outside these cities the only options for Internet access were <a href="dial-up">dial-up</a> from Beltelecom or <a href="GPRS">GPRS</a>/<a href="cdma2000">cdma2000</a> from mobile operators.

Internet access in Belarus is predominantly urban, with 60 percent of users living in the capital Minsk. The profile of the average Internet user is male, university educated, living in the capital, and working in a state enterprise. The Ministry for Statistics and Analysis estimates that one in four families in Belarus owns a computer at home. The popularity of <a href="Internet%20caf%C3%A9">Internet café</a>s has fallen in recent years, as most users prefer to access the Internet from home or work. Russian is the most widely used language by Belarusians on the Internet, followed by Belarusian, English, and Polish.

In mid-2009 there were more than 22,300 Belarusian Web sites, of which roughly 13,500 domain names were registered with the top-level domain name "<a href=".by">.by</a>".

In June 2011 E-Belarus.org listed:


Many western human rights groups state that <a href="civil%20right">civil right</a>s and free expression are severely limited in Belarus, though there are some individuals and groups that refuse to be controlled and some journalists have disappeared.

Because the Belarus government limits freedom of expression, several opposition media outlets are broadcast from nearby countries to help provide Belorussians an alternative points of view. This includes the Polish state-owned <a href="Belsat">Belsat</a> TV station and <a href="European%20Radio%20for%20Belarus">European Radio for Belarus</a> (Eŭrapéjskaje Rádyjo dla Biełarúsi)

Armed Forces of Belarus

The Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus (<a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a>: "Узброеныя сілы Рэспублікі Беларусь – УС РБ", "Uzbrojenyja sily Respubliki Bielaruś", <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>: "Boopyжённыe cилы Pecпyблики Бeлapycь", "Vooruzhennye sily Respubliki Belarus") consist of the Ground Forces and the <a href="Belarusian%20Air%20Force">Air and Air Defence Forces</a>, all under the command of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Belarus">Republic of Belarus</a> <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Belarus%29">Ministry of Defence</a>. Being a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a>, Belarus has no <a href="navy">navy</a>.

In 2007 the IISS estimated that personnel in the armed forces numbered 72,940 (<a href="IISS">IISS</a> 2007), although a reduction to 60,000 was planned. Most soldiers are <a href="conscripts">conscripts</a> serving for a period 12 months (with higher education) or 18 month (without).

The previous <a href="Belarusian%20National%20Republic">Belarusian National Republic</a> of March 1918 to 1919 did not have time to create <a href="armed%20forces">armed forces</a> in its brief existence, although attempts to create a military have been documented. The Republic of Belarus has conducted effective military reforms within the last decade which have reshaped its armed forces as a relatively effective force for a small state in somewhat difficult economic conditions.

The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Belarus (Russian: Министерство обороны Республики Беларусь, Belarusian: Мiнiстэрства абароны Рэспублікі Беларусь) is the government organisation that is charged with the duties of raising and maintaining the Armed Forces of Belarus. The formation of the ministry began in 1992, after the events of 1991 in which the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> had effectively dissolved. Seven officers have served as Minister of Defence of Belarus: <a href="Petr%20Chaus">Petr Chaus</a>, <a href="Pavel%20Kozlovskii">Pavel Kozlovskii</a>, <a href="Anatoly%20Kostenko">Anatoly Kostenko</a>, <a href="Leonid%20Maltsev">Leonid Maltsev</a> (1995–96), Colonel General <a href="Alexander%20Chumakov%20%28general%29">Alexander Chumakov</a>, a Russian officer, (1996–2001), <a href="Yuriy%20Zhadobin">Yuriy Zhadobin</a> (2009–2014), and <a href="Andrei%20Ravkov">Andrei Ravkov</a> (2014-current).

Until 1991 the Soviet <a href="Belorussian%20Military%20District">Belorussian Military District</a> comprised the <a href="5th%20Guards%20Tank%20Army">5th Guards Tank Army</a> (HQ Bobruisk), the <a href="7th%20Tank%20Army">7th Tank Army</a> (HQ Borisov), the <a href="28th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">28th Army</a> (HQ Grodno), the <a href="120th%20Guards%20Mechanised%20Brigade">120th Guards Motor Rifle Division</a>, the 72nd Guards United Training Center and logistical units and formations. In addition to these troops Belarus was host to centrally controlled formations, namely the <a href="103rd%20Guards%20Airborne%20Division">103rd Guards Airborne Division</a>, the <a href="38th%20Guards%20Mobile%20Brigade">38th Guards Airborne Brigade</a>, the 11th Air Defence Corps of the <a href="2nd%20Air%20Defence%20Army">2nd Air Defence Army</a>, the <a href="1st%20Air%20Army">26th Air Army</a> and also units and formations of the <a href="Strategic%20Rocket%20Forces">Strategic Rocket Forces</a>, <a href="Long%20Range%20Aviation">Long Range Aviation</a>, the Navy and special forces.

In late 1991 the 5th Guards Tank Army comprised the <a href="55th%20Guards%20Rifle%20Division">30th Guards Motor Rifle Division</a>, newly arrived from Czechoslovakia, and the <a href="193rd%20Tank%20Division">193rd Tank Division</a>, plus two armament and equipment storage bases (the former 8th Guards and 29th Tank Divisions), and army troops. The 7th Tank Army comprised the <a href="3rd%20Guards%20Tank%20Division">3rd Guards Tank Division</a>, <a href="34th%20Tank%20Division">34th</a>, and <a href="37th%20Guards%20Tank%20Division">37th Guards Tank Division</a>s, plus army troops. The 28th Army comprised four divisions, one of which was a low-status mobilisation division. Also arriving from the <a href="Southern%20Group%20of%20Forces">Southern Group of Forces</a> in Hungary was the <a href="19th%20Guards%20Tank%20Division">19th Guards Tank Division</a>.

On September 20, 1991 the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed resolution "On the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus" and on January 11, 1992 resolution "On the Armed Forces deployed in the territory of the Republic of Belarus." On March 18, 1992 the parliament passed resolution "On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus" that bound the government "to start the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus as of March 20, 1992" and "to submit to the Supreme Soviet for approval the suggested structure of the Armed Forces, their size and order of their material and technical supplies".

On May 6, 1992 the <a href="Belorussian%20Military%20District">Belorussian Military District</a> was abolished. The Belarusian Ministry of Defence and the Main Staff were formed from its resources. The former first deputy commander and military district Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General P P Kozlovskiy, was appointed Minister of Defence on 22 April 1992, taking over from acting Minister of Defence Colonel-General Petr Chaus.

On November 3, 1992, Belarus passed the law "On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus" defining the status, structure and guiding principles of the Armed Forces. After the introduction of presidency the law was amended twice: on September 4, 1996 and on November 9, 1999 but on the whole the law retains its initial contents.

On January 1, 1993 all service personnel on Belarusian soil were required to either take an oath of loyalty to Belarus, or leave. This oath however did not alleviate concerns regarding loyalty to Russia in time of crisis, especially since nearly 50% of all military personnel were ethnically Russian at the end of 1992.

In June 1995, President Lushenko issued a decree on the Mobile Forces. By June 1996, they comprised a headquarters in Vitebsk, two brigades drawn from the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, the 38th Independent Mobile Brigade (<a href="Brest%2C%20Belarus">Brest, Belarus</a>), an air transport regiment, and communications, logistics, and engineer units.

Membership in the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>, as well as the 1996 treaty on the <a href="Union%20of%20Russia%20and%20Belarus">Union of Russia and Belarus</a> and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State in 1999, confirmed a close partnership with Russia. Much of the air defence system is integrated into the Russian air defence network, and in 2006 the two nations signed an agreement on the creation of a unified air defence system.

Belarus government websites say that the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Belarus is supported by Central Command Support Elements and the General Staff of the Armed Forces.
Combat Support Elements of the Armed Forces included Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare, Signals, Engineer, NBC Defence, Navigation and Topography, and Maintenance organisations. Logistic Elements of the Armed Forces provided Material Support, Logistic Support, Medical Support, Veterinarian Support, and Military Construction.

In 1995 the Military Academy of Belarus was set up on the basis of two military educational institutions – the Minsk Air Defence and Rocket School of the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Defence%20Forces">Soviet Air Defence Forces</a> and the Minsk Higher Military Command School. Its 10 departments train officers of 38 specialties for practically all arms of service. Also in 1995 it was given the status of a government institution of secondary special military education for young men.

The <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> said that in 1994 Belarus had ground forces of 52,500. They were organized into three corps headquarters, two motor divisions, one airborne division, the <a href="51st%20Guards%20Artillery%20Division">51st Guards Artillery Division</a> at <a href="Osipovichi">Osipovichi</a>, three mechanized divisions, one airborne brigade, three surface-to-surface missile brigades, two antitank brigades, one special duties brigade, and seven anti-aircraft missile brigades. Equipment included 3,108 main battle tanks (seventy-nine T-54, 639 T-55, 291 T-62, 299 T-64, eight T-80, and 1,800 T-72), 419 medium-range launchers, sixty surface to-surface missiles, and 350 surface-to-air missiles.

In 1993 the 7th Tank Army was reorganised as the 7th Army Corps. In 1994 the 7th Army Corps was redesignated as the 65th Army Corps, still located at <a href="Barysaw">Borisov</a>.

By January 1, 1995, the composition of the Belarusian ground forces had changed. The <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> estimated at the time that Ministry of Defence forces included the <a href="103rd%20Guards%20Airborne%20Division">103rd Guards Airborne Division</a> and the <a href="38th%20Guards%20Mobile%20Brigade">38th Separate Assault-Landing Brigade</a>; the <a href="28th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">28th Army Corps</a> (<a href="Grodno%20Region">Grodno Region</a> and <a href="Brest%20Region">Brest Region</a>), composed of headquarters at <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a>, the 6th Separate Mechanised Infantry Brigade, the <a href="11th%20Guards%20Mechanized%20Brigade">11th Guards Mechanised Infantry Brigade</a>, the 50th Separate Mechanised Infantry Brigade, the Armament and Equipment base, and corps units (missile troops, antiaircraft, chemical and engineer troops, signals, and rear services); the <a href="65th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">65th Army Corps</a> (Minsk and <a href="Vitebsk%20Region">Vitebsk Region</a>s), composed of headquarters at <a href="Barysaw">Borisov</a>, three armament and equipment bases, and corps units; and the 5th Guards Army Corps (Minsk and Mahilyow regions) made up of headquarters at Babruysk, the 30th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade, two Armament and Equipment bases, and corps units.

Actually, the 103rd Guards Airborne Division had been reorganized as Headquarters, Mobile Forces, in 1993.
On 1 August 1996 the 51st Guards Artillery Division was reorganised as the 51st Guards Central Group of Artillery, still located at <a href="Osipovichi">Osipovichi</a>.

On 21 December 2001, a major reorganisation of the Ground Forces produced two operational-territorial commands, formed from two former corps headquarters. All Belarus ground forces were now grouped within these two commands, the <a href="Western%20Operational%20Command%20%28Belarus%29">Western Operational Command</a> at <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a>, former from the previous 28th Army Corps, the former Soviet <a href="28th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">28th Army</a>, and the <a href="North%20Western%20Operational%20Command">North Western Operational Command</a>, the former 65th Army Corps, at <a href="Barysaw">Barysaw</a> (Borisov).

Since about 2001, territorial defence forces, which as of 2002 number around 150,000, have been forming, organised into battalions, companies, and platoons spread across Belarus.

In 2007, the Land Forces consisted of 29,600 soldiers (<a href="6th%20Guards%20Mechanised%20Brigade">6th Guards Mechanised Brigade</a> (<a href="Grodno">Grodno</a>), <a href="11th%20Guards%20Mechanized%20Brigade">11th Guards Mechanized Brigade</a> at <a href="Slonim">Slonim</a>, the <a href="120th%20Guards%20Mechanised%20Brigade">120th Guards Mechanised Brigade</a> (<a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>), 38th and 103rd Mobile Brigades (organized similarly to Soviet airborne regiments, not all of them are equipped with <a href="BMD-1">BMD-1</a>), <a href="5th%20Spetsnaz%20Brigade">5th Spetsnaz Brigade</a> (<a href="Maryina%20Horka">Maryina Horka</a>), five artillery brigades and four regiments, two MRL regiments, 15th, 29th, 115th, 120th and 302nd SAM Brigades, two SSM brigades, two brigades and one regiment of engineers, 8th independent NBC Brigade, two signals brigades, 40th independent NBC battalion. Army equipment includes 1800 main battle tanks (MBT) and 2600 AFV/APC. The weapons and equipment storage bases include the 50th (Brest), 19th, <a href="34th%20Tank%20Division">34th</a> & <a href="37th%20Guards%20Tank%20Division">37th</a> (former tank divisions), <a href="3rd%20Guards%20Tank%20Division">3rd</a>, and 28th (<a href="Baranovichi">Baranovichi</a>). Weapons storage bases that have been disbanded include the 29th, 30th, <a href="193rd%20Tank%20Division">193rd</a>, and the storage base that used to be the <a href="8th%20Guards%20Tank%20Division">8th Guards Tank Division</a> at <a href="Marina%20Gorka">Marina Gorka</a>.

In 2012, it is reported that there are six mechanised brigades in the Ground Forces: three full-strength, the 6th (Grodno), 11th (Slonim), and <a href="120th%20Guards%20Mechanised%20Brigade">120th Guards Mechanised Brigade</a> at <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>. The others are at reduced strength, where there is one battalion, the 19th (Zaslonova), 37th, and 50th (Baranovichi).

In 2007 the <a href="Belarusian%20Air%20Force">Air Force and Air Defence Force of Belarus</a> (AF & ADF) consisted of 18,170 personnel (two fighter/interceptor bases, four FGA/reconnaissance squadrons, one transport air base, training aircraft, and attack and support helicopters, SAM units). Air Force equipment included in 2004 260 fighter-ground attack/training aircraft and 80 attack helicopters. According to Belarus government websites, the Air Forces now have two commands, the Western Operational-Tactical Command and the North-Western Operational-Tactical Command.

The 61st and 927th Air Bases have now merged into the 61st (fighter) Air Base at <a href="Baranovichi%20%28air%20base%29">Baranovichi</a>, flying <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a>s and <a href="Su-27">Su-27</a>s, and the 206th Air Base (Ross) has merged into the 116th Guards Assault Air Base at <a href="Lida%20%28air%20base%29">Lida</a>, flying <a href="Su-25">Su-25</a>s.

The Internal Troops were formed from the former Soviet <a href="Internal%20Troops">Internal Troops</a> after the collapse of the Soviet Union. They consist of three independent brigades and seven independent battalions (consecutively numbered). Among the Internal Troop formations is the 3rd Red Banner separate special purpose Brigade (V/Ch 3214, located in <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, in the <a href="Administrative%20subdivisions%20of%20Minsk%23Microraions">district</a> Uruchcha, "Uruchenskaya Brigade"). This brigade performs crowd control, combating terrorism tasks, and can assist border guards in case of complications. In addition, the brigade has been training for combined arms operations in the event of armed conflict. It was formed in the 1990s on the base of the 334th Regiment of the 120th 'Rogachev' Guards Motor Rifle Division.

The Government Directive of 20 March 1992 ‘On the Establishment of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus’ founded the Belarusian army. The Soviet troops of the BMD were smoothly converted into Belarusian military units. Yet one of the first tasks of the Belarusian government was a reduction in its numbers. 240,000 soldiers and officers were serving in the Belarusian Military District. By early 2013 the numbers of military personnel had been scaled down nearly fourfold since 1991. In February 2014, Belorusskaya Voyennaya Gazeta, the official publication of the
Ministry of Defense revealed that the Belarusian Armed Forces contains about 59,500 personnel, including 46,000 soldiers and 13,000 civilians.

The military forces of Belarus are exclusively armed with Soviet-era equipment inherited from the Soviet Union. Although large in numbers, some Western experts consider some of it outdated. The MBTs are of Russian type <a href="T-72">T-72</a>, <a href="T-62">T-62</a>, and <a href="T-55">T-55</a>, the APCs and IFVs are of Russian type <a href="MT-LB">MT-LB</a>, <a href="BMP-2">BMP-2</a>, <a href="BMP-1">BMP-1</a>, and the <a href="BMD-1">BMD-1</a>, and Russian type trucks are the <a href="GAZ-66">GAZ-66</a> and the KAMAZ-6560. The Air Force is equipped with <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a> fighters, <a href="Su-25">Su-25</a> bombers, as well as <a href="Mil%20Mi-8">Mi-8</a>, <a href="Mi-24">Mi-24</a>, and some old, Polish built <a href="Mil%20Mi-2">Mi-2</a> helicopters. In December 2005, Belarus bought 10 <a href="Aero%20L-39">L-39C</a> jet trainer aircraft from the <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and plans have been announced to buy around 18 used <a href="Su-30">Su-30</a>K fighters that were originally sent to India for a time. In 2006, four batteries ("divizions" in Russian terminology; about 6 systems each) of <a href="S-300%20%28missile%29">S-300</a> anti-aircraft systems were acquired from Russia to reinforce the <a href="Joint%20CIS%20Air%20Defense%20System">Joint CIS Air Defense System</a>.

Foreign relations of Belarus

The <a href="Byelorussian%20SSR">Byelorussian SSR</a> was one of only two <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> republics to be separate members of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (the other being the <a href="Ukrainian%20SSR">Ukrainian SSR</a>). Both republics and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> joined the UN when the organization was founded in 1945.

After the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>, at which time Belarus gained its independence, Belarus became a member of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a> (CIS), the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Cooperation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE), <a href="NATO">NATO</a>'s <a href="Partnership%20for%20Peace">Partnership for Peace</a>, the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Cooperation%20Council">North Atlantic Cooperation Council</a>, the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>, and the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>. The adoption by Supreme Council of the BSSR of the declaration of State Sovereignty of Belarus on 1990 was a turning point on the development of the state. It has also been <a href="Union%20State">in a supranational union with Russia</a> since 2 April 1996, although this has had little practical effect.

The introduction of <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> between Russia and Belarus in mid-1995 led to a spectacular growth in bilateral trade, which was only temporarily reversed in the wake of the <a href="History%20of%20post-Soviet%20Russia%23The%20crises%20of%201998">financial crisis of 1998</a>. President <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> sought to develop a closer relationship with Russia. The framework for the Union of Russia and Belarus was set out in the Treaty On the Formation of a Community of Russia and Belarus (1996), the Treaty on Russia-Belarus Union, the Union Charter (1997), and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State (1999). The integration treaties contained commitments to <a href="monetary%20union">monetary union</a>, <a href="civil%20rights">equal rights</a>, single citizenship, and a common defence and <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign policy</a>.

Following the recognition of Belarus as an independent state in December 1991 by the <a href="European%20Community">European Community</a>, EC/EU-Belarus relations initially experienced a steady progress. The signature of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) in 1995 signaled a commitment to political, economic and trade cooperation. Some assistance was provided to Belarus within the framework of the <a href="TACIS">TACIS</a> programme and also through various aid programs and loans. However, progress in EU-Belarus relations stalled in 1996 after serious setbacks to the development of democracy, and the <a href="Drazdy%20conflict">Drazdy conflict</a>. The EU did not recognize the 1996 constitution, which replaced the 1994 constitution. The <a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Council of the European Union</a> decided against Belarus in 1997: The PCA was not concluded, nor was its trade-related part; Belarusian membership in the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> was not supported; bilateral relations at the ministerial level were suspended and EU technical assistance programs were frozen.
Acknowledging the lack of progress in relation to bilateral relations and the internal situation following the position adopted in 1997, the EU adopted a step-by-step approach in 1999, whereby sanctions would be gradually lifted upon fulfillment of the four benchmarks set by the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a>. In 2000, some moderately positive developments toward the implementation of recommendations made by the OSCE AMG were observed but were not sufficient in the realm of access to fair and free elections.

The United States has encouraged Belarus to conclude and adhere to agreements with the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, as well as to undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June 1992 but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Belarus is eligible for <a href="Export-Import%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Export-Import Bank</a> short-term financing <a href="insurance">insurance</a> for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated. The IMF granted standby credit in September 1995, but Belarus has fallen off the program and did not receive the second tranche of funding, which had been scheduled for regular intervals throughout 1996.

The United States - along with the European Union - has restricted the travel of President Alexander Lukashenko and members of his inner circle, as well as imposing economic sanctions.

The governments of Belarus and <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> concluded an agreement about mutual visa-free travel. It was signed in <a href="Quito">Quito</a> on June 20, 2014, ratified by Belarus law on December 29, 2014.

The structure of Belarus trade reflects the low competitiveness and output decline of manufacturing industry in the country over the past decade, leading to the predominance of primary production, work-intensive goods as exports. Belarusian exports to the EU consist mainly of agricultural and textile products, while imports from the EU are primarily machinery.

Belarus is a beneficiary of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The European Commission decided in 2003 to initiate an investigation into violations of freedom of association in Belarus as the first step towards a possible temporary withdrawal of the GSP from Belarus.
In December 2004, the EU adopted a position aimed at imposing travel restrictions on officials from Belarus responsible for the fraudulent parliamentary elections and referendum on 17 October 2004, and for human rights violations during subsequent peaceful political demonstrations in <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>.
The <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> released a statement in March 2005 in which it denounced the Belarusian government as a dictatorship. The European parliamentarians were primarily concerned about the suppression of independent media outlets in the country and the fraudulent referendum. A resolution of the European Parliament declared that the personal bank accounts of President Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarusian officials should be tracked and frozen.

In 2005, <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> reported a "pattern of deliberate obstruction, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders" in Belarus. <a href="Reporters%20Without%20Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a> accused the Belarusian authorities of hounding and arresting journalists from the country's Polish minority. Lukashenko has closed the country's main Polish newspaper, printing a bogus paper instead with the same name and size that praises his incumbent government. Several foreign, mainly Polish, journalists have been arrested or expelled from the country. Lukashenko accused Poland of an attempt to overthrow his government by stirring up a peaceful revolution in Belarus comparable to the <a href="Orange%20Revolution">Orange Revolution</a> in <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> in 2004.

Later in 2005 the Belarusian <a href="riot%20police">riot police</a> seized the headquarters of the <a href="Union%20of%20Poles%20in%20Belarus">Union of Poles in Belarus</a>, an association representing the 400,000 <a href="ethnic%20minority">ethnic minority</a> Polish living in western areas the country that were part of Poland until <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The dispute between Poland and Belarus escalated further as Poland responded by recalling its ambassador from Belarus for indefinite consultations, and called on the European Union to impose sanctions on the Belarusian leadership in order to curtail the <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> abuses in Belarus. Belarusian papers described this as a 'dirty political game', and part of a 'cold war' waged on president Lukashenko. Polish Foreign Minister <a href="Adam%20Rotfeld">Adam Rotfeld</a> said a clampdown was under way, aimed at destroying ""all elements of political pluralism and independence"" in Belarus.
In August 2005 the EU's executive commission called for human rights to be respected in Belarus. The commission said it was considering offering support to independent media in the country and had set aside more than eight million euros from its budget to offer support for human rights activities. France expressed her solidarity with Poland on the issue of human rights in Belarus a day after the EU declared it was worried about the situation in that country. Several former Soviet Republics, including neighbouring Ukraine, also expressed their concerns about the development of the situation in Belarus.

In May 2009 Belarus and the EU agree on cooperation in the <a href="Eastern%20Partnership">Eastern Partnership</a> (EaP). However, it is contended by some scholars that the (EaP) is unable to create a workable partnership. This proved to be correct when Belarus withdrew from the Partnership on 30 September 2011.

In August 2012, Belarus expelled all <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> diplomats, including the Swedish Ambassador to Belarus, Stefan Eriksson, and closed its embassy in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, after a Swedish <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> firm released <a href="teddy%20bear">teddy bear</a>s carrying pro-democracy flyers in parachutes from an airplane over Minsk on 4 July 2012. Lukashenko also fired his air defence chief and the head of the border guards over the incident. Their replacements have been told not to hesitate to use force to stop future intrusions from abroad.

Pakistan has remained a long time ally of Belarus. The relations grew more stronger when Belarus President Alexender Lukashenko visited Islamabad. Pakistan has reportedly provided Free of Cost overhaul facilities to for the tanks and Armoured vehicles of Belarus in its <a href="Heavy%20Industries%20Taxila">Heavy Industries Taxila</a>. Both nations have a Joint Trade Cooperation that looks after the matters related to trade between Pakistan and Belarus.

Russia remains the largest and most important partner for Belarus both in the political and economic fields. After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' <a href="customs%20union">customs duties were unified</a> in March 2001 but the customs controls were soon restored. In terms of trade, almost half of Belarusian export goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian <a href="industry">industry</a>, Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of <a href="raw%20material">raw material</a>s and components. After initial negotiation with the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Russian Central Bank</a> on <a href="monetary%20union">monetary union</a>, the <a href="Russian%20ruble">Russian ruble</a> was set to be introduced in Belarus in 2004, but this was postponed first until 2005, then until 2006, and now seems to have been suspended indefinitely.

The establishment of diplomatic relations between the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea">Republic of Korea</a> and the Republic of Belarus started on 10 February 1992.

Belarus has had an ongoing discussion to relaunch IMF-backed reforms, concluding an arrangement for an IMF Staff-monitored program (SMP) in 2001. However, the authorities did not follow through with reforms as hoped, leaving an uncertain future for IMF-backed cooperation. Belarus authorities have said on several occasions that they find IMF intervention and recommendations in Belarus counter-productive to the economic development of those countries.
The relationships with the United States have been further strained, after <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">Congress of the United States</a> unanimously passed the <a href="Belarus%20Democracy%20Act%20of%202004">Belarus Democracy Act of 2004</a>.

On 7 March 2008 the government of Belarus ejected US Ambassador <a href="Karen%20B.%20Stewart">Karen B. Stewart</a> from the country, following a row over travel restrictions placed on President Lukashenko and sanctions against state-owned chemical company <a href="Belneftekhim">Belneftekhim</a>. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry announced at the same time that it was recalling its own ambassador to the US. This was followed by the expulsion of ten other U.S. embassy staff from Minsk in late April. At the same time the government of Belarus ordered the U.S. Embassy in Minsk to cut its staff by half. A <a href="White%20House">White House</a> spokesman described the expulsion as "deeply disappointing".

Due to strained relations with the United States and the European Union, as well as occasional high-level disputes with Russia over prices on core imported natural resources such as oil and gas, Belarus aims to develop better relations with countries in other regions like Middle East, Asia, and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>.

Transport in Belgium

Transport in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> is facilitated with well-developed road, air, rail and water networks. The rail network has of electrified tracks. There are of roads, among which there are of motorways, of main roads and of other paved roads. There is also a well-developed urban rail network in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and <a href="Charleroi">Charleroi</a>. The ports of <a href="port%20of%20Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and <a href="port%20of%20Bruges-Zeebrugge">Bruges-Zeebrugge</a> are two of the biggest seaports in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. <a href="Brussels%20Airport">Brussels Airport</a> is Belgium's biggest airport.

Rail transport in Belgium was historically managed by the <a href="National%20Railway%20Company%20of%20Belgium">National Railway Company of Belgium</a>, known as SNCB in French and NMBS in Dutch. In 2005, the public company was split into 2 companies: <a href="Infrabel">Infrabel</a>, which manages the rail network and SNCB/NMBS itself, which manages the freight and passenger services. Both companies are held by a third company, named SNCB/NMBS Holding. There is a total of , ( double track (as of 1998)), of which are electrified, mainly at 3,000 volts DC but with at 25 kV 50 Hz AC (2004) and all on <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> of . In 2004 the National Railway Company of Belgium, carried 178.4 million passengers a total of 8,676 million passenger-kilometres. Due to the high population density, operations are relatively profitable, so tickets are cheap and the frequency of services is high. The SNCB/NMBS is continually updating its rolling stock.

The network currently includes <a href="High-speed%20rail%20in%20Belgium">four high speed lines</a>, three operating up to , and one up to . <a href="HSL%201">HSL 1</a> runs from just south of Brussels to the French border, where it continues to <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, and from there to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> or <a href="London">London</a>. <a href="HSL%202">HSL 2</a> runs from <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> to <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a>. <a href="HSL%203">HSL 3</a> continues this route from Liège to the German border near <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>. <a href="HSL%204">HSL 4</a> runs from Antwerp to <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> by meeting <a href="HSL-Zuid">HSL-Zuid</a> at the border with <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

Electrification is at <a href="List%20of%20current%20systems%20for%20electric%20rail%20traction">3 kV DC</a>, with the exception of the new high-speed lines, and of two recently electrified lines in the south of the country which are at <a href="List%20of%20current%20systems%20for%20electric%20rail%20traction">25 kV AC</a>. Trains, contrary to tram and road traffic, run on the left.


An urban commuter rail network, Brussels RER (, ), is currently being set up the capital. It was initially supposed to be in service in 2012, but some observers expect it not to be ready before 2019.

In Belgium an extensive system of tram-like local railways called "<a href="Vicinal%20tramway">vicinal or buurtspoor</a>" lines crossed the country in the first half of the 20th century, and had a greater route length than the main-line <a href="railway">railway</a> system. The only survivors of the vicinal/buurtspoor system are the <a href="Belgian%20coast%20tram">Kusttram</a> (covering almost the entire coast from France to the Netherlands, being the longest tram line in the world) and some sections of the <a href="Charleroi%20Pre-metro">Charleroi Pre-metro</a>. Urban tram networks exist in Antwerp (the <a href="Antwerp%20Pre-metro">Antwerp Pre-metro</a>), <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> and Brussels (the <a href="Brussels%20trams">Brussels trams</a>), and are gradually being extended. The only <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> system in Belgium is the <a href="Brussels%20Metro">Brussels Metro</a>. Some heavy <a href="rapid%20transit">metro</a> infrastructures were built in Brussels, Antwerp and the Charleroi area, but these are currently used by <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> vehicles, and their conversion to full <a href="rapid%20transit">metro</a> is not envisaged at present due to lack of funds.

Regional transport in Belgium is operated by regional companies: <a href="De%20Lijn">De Lijn</a> in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> operates the Kusttram and the Antwerp pre-metro as well as a bus network, <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20R%C3%A9gionale%20Wallonne%20du%20Transport">TEC</a> in <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a> operates the Charleroi pre-metro as well as a bus network and <a href="Brussels%20Intercommunal%20Transport%20Company">MIVB/STIB</a> in the <a href="Brussels%20Capital-Region">Brussels Capital-Region</a> operates the Brussels metro as well as the Brussels tram and bus network. Despite this regional organization, some bus and tram routes operated by STIB/MIVB go beyond the regional border, and some bus routes operated by TEC or De Lijn transport passengers from the Flemish or Walloon regions to the capital city or in the other regions.

The road network in Belgium is managed by regional authorities, meaning that a road section in Flanders is managed by the <a href="Flemish%20Government">Flemish Government</a>, a road section in Brussels by the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Brussels-Capital%20Region">Brussels government</a> and a road section in Wallonia by the <a href="Walloon%20Government">Walloon Government</a>. This explains that road signs in Flanders are written in Dutch, even when referring to a Walloon region, and conversely, which can be confusing for foreigners who do not know the different translations of Flemish or Walloon cities in the other language. The road network in Belgium is made of highways, national (or regional) roads (the secondary network) and communal roads (or streets). Communal roads are managed at the municipal level. There are also a number of orbital roads in Belgium around major cities.


Belgian road numbering evolved during the middle decades of the twentieth century, in a relatively inconsistent way. Road number allocations became less systematic during the surge in road building that took place in the 1960s and 70s. Frequently downgraded and deteriorating older national roads retained two digit numbers while newer major roads were identified with less instantly memorable three digit numbers, if only because the shorter numbers were already taken. 1985 saw a comprehensive renumbering of the "N" (National) roads which now followed the scheme described below.

The highways in Belgium are marked with a letter A and a number. Most often however the European numbering system for the <a href="international%20E-road%20network">international E-road network</a> is used. There is however not always a one-on-one relationship between the two numbering systems along the whole length of the highways.


The ringways (or orbital roads) around bigger cities have their own series of numbers. The names start with a R then a first digit indicating the (old) province, and sometimes a second digit to further differentiate in between different ringways.

Some major examples are:

The national roads were renumbered in 1985 according to a national scheme and are identified with the letter N followed by a number.

The principal national roads fan out from Brussels, numbered in clockwise order:

Secondary national roads intersect these.

National roads have an N plus 1, 2 or 3 digits. National roads numbered with 3 digits are provincial roads, their first number indicating the province in which the road begins:

Between 1993 and 2012 the average age of the passengers cars registered as running in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> increased from just over 6 years and 4 months to 8 years and 17 days. 2012 data for other European countries are not yet available, but in 2010 the average age of car Belgium was 7.9 years against a <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> average of 8.3 years. Government policy provides an important clue as to one reason for the relative newness of the national car parc. Despite recent high-profile plant closures by <a href="Genk%20Body%20%26amp%3B%20Assembly">Ford</a> and <a href="Vilvoorde%20Renault%20Factory">Renault</a>, Belgium remains an important centre for automobile component and passenger car production, with important plants operated by <a href="Volvo%20Cars%20Ghent">Volvo</a> and <a href="Audi%20Brussels">Audi</a>, and this is reflected in a relatively benign taxation environment whereby company cars are a still a popular and relatively tax efficient element in many remuneration packages.

Economy of Benin

The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a> and <a href="cotton">cotton</a>. Cotton accounts for 40% of GDP and roughly 80% of official export receipts. There is also production of <a href="textile">textile</a>s, palm products, and <a href="cocoa%20bean">cocoa bean</a>s. <a href="Maize">Maize</a> (corn), <a href="bean">bean</a>s, <a href="rice">rice</a>, <a href="peanut">peanut</a>s, <a href="cashew">cashew</a>s, <a href="pineapple">pineapple</a>s, <a href="cassava">cassava</a>, <a href="yam%20%28vegetable%29">yams</a>, and other various tubers are grown for local subsistence. <a href="Benin">Benin</a> began producing a modest quantity of offshore oil in October 1982. Production ceased in recent years but exploration of new sites is ongoing.

A modest fishing fleet provides fish and shrimp for local subsistence and export to Europe. Formerly government-owned commercial activities are now privatized. A French <a href="brewing">brewer</a> acquired the former state-run brewery. Smaller businesses are privately owned by Beninese citizens, but some firms are foreign owned, primarily French and <a href="Lebanon">Lebanese</a>. The private commercial and agricultural sectors remain the principal contributors to growth.

Since the transition to a <a href="Democracy">democratic</a> government in 1990, Benin has undergone an economic recovery. A large injection of external investment from both private and public sources has alleviated the economic difficulties of the early 1990s caused by global recession and persistently low commodity prices (although the latter continues to affect the economy). The manufacturing sector is confined to some light industry, which is mainly involved in processing primary products and the cow production of consumer goods. A planned joint <a href="hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> project with neighboring <a href="Togo">Togo</a> is intended to reduce Benin's dependence on imported energy mostly from <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, which currently accounts for a significant proportion of the country's imports.

The service sector has grown quickly, stimulated by economic liberalization and fiscal reform, and the use of modern technology such as automobiles and computers has grown considerably as a result. Membership of the <a href="CFA%20Franc%20Zone">CFA Franc Zone</a> offers reasonable currency stability as well as access to French economic support. Benin sells its products mainly to France and, in smaller quantities, to the Netherlands, Korea, Japan, and India. France is Benin's leading source for imports. Benin is also a member of the <a href="Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS).

Despite its rapid growth, the economy of Benin still remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth in real output averaged a sound 5% since 1996, but a rapid population rise offset much of this growth on a per capita basis. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Commercial and transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, particularly fuel shortages.

Although <a href="trade%20unions%20in%20Benin">trade unions in Benin</a> represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the <a href="International%20Trade%20Union%20Confederation">International Trade Union Confederation</a> (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of <a href="child%20labor">child labour</a>, and the continuing issue of <a href="unfree%20labour">forced labour</a>.

In December 2014, the <a href="Bureau%20of%20International%20Labor%20Affairs">Bureau of International Labor Affairs</a> issued a "<a href="List%20of%20Goods%20Produced%20by%20Child%20Labor%20or%20Forced%20Labor">List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</a>" in which the Republic of Benin was mentioned among 74 other countries where significant instances of child labor were observed. Two major products involved such working conditions in Benin: cotton and crushed granite.

Benin’s financial sector is dominated by banks, and in general remains shallow. However, a series of reforms were undertaken in the 1990s, which resulted in the consolidation of the banking sector and in the privatization of all state banks.

A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999. There is no customer deposit insurance system.

Benin has a lively and diversified microfinance sector. Data from 2003 by the Central Bank stated a penetration rate of microfinance services of almost 60 percent. In 2006 the Ministry of Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women counted 762 organizations with 1308 branches, including Cooperatives, NGOs, Savings/Credit Associations and government projects. Programmes for strengthening the sector are carried out on national and regional levels, such as the PRAFIDE (Programme Régional d’Appui à la finance Décentralisée). The microfinance sector is also subject to supervision through the Central Bank as well as the responsible Ministry for Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women.

Benin is member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeur Mobiliés (BRVM) located in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Stocks were issued by a number of companies in the region. Listed bonds were partly issued by companies and partly by governments of the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UEMOA).

The payment and settlement system and clearing mechanisms were reformed in 2004 through the BCEAO and offer RTGS and SWIFT access to banks, financial institutions, the stock exchange as well as the Central bank and special banks.

Economy of Bhutan

The economy of <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, one of the world's smallest and least developed countries, is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for more than 60% of the population. Agriculture consists largely of <a href="subsistence%20farming">subsistence farming</a> and <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a>. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.

The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's financial assistance. Most production in the industrial sector is of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian <a href="migrant%20labour">migrant labour</a>. Model education, social, and environment programs are underway with support from multilateral development organisations.

Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labour, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. <a href="Hydropower">Hydropower</a> exports to India have boosted Bhutan's overall growth, even though GDP fell in 2008 as a result of a slowdown in India, its predominant export market.

<doc id="3600" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3600" title="Blindness in literature">
Blindness in literature

Different cultures through history have depicted <a href="blindness">blindness</a> in a variety of ways; among the <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>, for example, it was a punishment from the gods, for which the afflicted individual was often granted compensation in the form of artistic genius. <a href="Judeo-Christian">Judeo-Christian</a> <a href="literature">literature</a> positioned blindness as a flaw; only through a cure could God’s love be made manifest, when the scales would fall away from the eyes of an afflicted individual upon contact with a holy man or relic. Almost without exception in early literature, blind people could bring this condition down upon themselves through sin or trespasses against the gods, but were never the sole instruments of its reversal.

It is impossible to make a blanket generalization about how the blind were treated in literature beyond that point – they were marvelous, gifted, evil, malicious, ignorant, wise, helpless, innocent, or burdensome depending upon who wrote the story – except to say that blindness is perceived to be such a loss that it leaves an indelible mark on a person’s character.

Even pioneers in training the blind, such as <a href="Dorothy%20Harrison%20Eustis">Dorothy Harrison Eustis</a>, harboured negative stereotypes about them. Blind people had, in her opinion, grown so accustomed to waiting on others as to be passive and 'whiney.'

Father Thomas Carroll, who founded the Carroll Centre for the Blind, wrote "Blindness: What It Is, What It Does and How to Live with It" in 1961. In it, he characterized blindness in terms of 20 losses, and as the 'death' of the sighted individual.
In "Moumoku Monogatari", <a href="Junichiro%20Tanizaki">Junichiro Tanizaki</a> retells the well-known tale of <a href="Oda%20Nobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> and <a href="Toyotomi%20Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> from the perspective of a blind servant. The character is portrayed as demonstrating a number of traditional Japanese virtues, but ultimately falls prey to his own human flaws.

"<a href="The%20Country%20of%20the%20Blind">The Country of the Blind</a>", a short story by <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, is one of the most well-known stories featuring blind characters. A sighted man finds himself in a country that has been isolated from the rest of the world for centuries, wherein all the inhabitants are blind even as their ancestors had been. These people are depicted as self-sufficient, having developed their other senses, but they are ultimately closed-minded and insular to the point of <a href="xenophobia">xenophobia</a>. As they themselves have no sight, they wish to deprive the traveler of his own eyes in this allegorical tale of stagnation.

"<a href="All%20the%20Light%20We%20Cannot%20See">All the Light We Cannot See</a>," a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Fiction">Pulitzer prize</a> winning novel by <a href="Anthony%20Doerr">Anthony Doerr</a>, tells the story of Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a young girl who has gone completely blind due to <a href="Cataract">cataracts</a> at the age of 6. She keeps her mind sharp with intricate puzzle boxes, which her father carves for her, and <a href="Braille">Braille</a> novels.

While blind and visually impaired people had contributed to the body of common literature for centuries, one notable example being the author of "Paradise Lost", <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>, the creation of autobiographical materials, or materials specific to blindness, is relatively new.

Most people are familiar with <a href="Helen%20Keller">Helen Keller</a>, who was both blind and deaf, but there has been considerable progress since the publication of her work.

Geography of Bosnia and Herzegovina

<a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> is located in <a href="Southeastern%20Europe">Southeastern Europe</a>, in the western <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. It has a 932 km border with <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> to the north and southwest, a 357 km border with <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> to the east, and a 249 km border with <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> to the southeast. It borders the Adriatic Sea along its 20 km (12.42 mi) coastline.

The most striking features of the local terrain are valleys and mountains which measure up to 2386 m in height. The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central <a href="Dinaric%20Alps">Dinaric Alps</a>. The northeastern parts reach into the <a href="Pannonian%20plain">Pannonian basin</a>, while in the south it borders the <a href="Adriatic%20sea">Adriatic sea</a>.

The country's natural resources include: coal, iron ore, bauxite, manganese, nickel, clay, gypsum, salt, sand, timber and hydropower

The country's name comes from the two regions <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> and <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>, which have a very vaguely defined border between them. Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four fifths of the entire country, while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the southern part of the country.

The major cities are the capital <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a> in the northwest region known as <a href="Bosanska%20Krajina">Bosanska Krajina</a>, <a href="Bijeljina">Bijeljina</a> and <a href="Tuzla">Tuzla</a> in the northeast, Zenica and Doboj in the central part of Bosnia and <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a>, the capital of <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>.

The south part of Bosnia has Mediterranean climate and a great deal of agriculture. Central Bosnia is the most mountainous part of Bosnia featuring prominent mountains <a href="Vla%C5%A1i%C4%87%20%28Bosnian%20mountain%29">Vlašić</a>, <a href="%C4%8Cvrsnica">Čvrsnica</a>, and <a href="Prenj">Prenj</a>. Eastern Bosnia also features mountains like <a href="Trebevi%C4%87">Trebević</a>, <a href="Jahorina">Jahorina</a>, <a href="Igman">Igman</a>, <a href="Bjela%C5%A1nica">Bjelašnica</a> and <a href="Treskavica">Treskavica</a>. It was here that the <a href="1984%20Winter%20Olympics">1984 Winter Olympics</a> were held.

Eastern Bosnia is heavily forested along the river Drina, and overall close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in Central, Eastern and Western parts of Bosnia. Northern Bosnia contains very fertile agricultural land along the river Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Parapannonian Plain stretching into neighbouring Croatia and Serbia. The river Sava and corresponding <a href="Posavina">Posavina</a> river basin hold the cities of Brčko, Bosanski Šamac, Bosanski Brod and Bosanska Gradiška.

The northwest part of Bosnia is called <a href="Bosanska%20Krajina">Bosanska Krajina</a> and holds the cities of <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a>, <a href="Prijedor">Prijedor</a>, <a href="Sanski%20Most">Sanski Most</a>, <a href="Jajce">Jajce</a>, Cazin, Velika Kladuša and <a href="Biha%C4%87">Bihać</a>. <a href="Kozara%20National%20Park">Kozara National Park</a> and Mrakovica World War II monument is located in this region.

The country has only of coastline, around the town of <a href="Neum">Neum</a> in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, although surrounded by Croatian peninsulas it is possible to get to the middle of the Adriatic from Neum. By United Nations law, Bosnia has a right of passage to the outer sea. Neum has many hotels and is an important tourism destination.
There are seven major rivers in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina:


<a href="Phytogeography">Phytogeographically</a>, Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the <a href="Boreal%20Kingdom">Boreal Kingdom</a> and is shared between the Illyrian province of the <a href="Circumboreal%20Region">Circumboreal Region</a> and Adriatic province of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Region">Mediterranean Region</a>. According to the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">WWF</a>, the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a>s: the Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.

The southern parts of the country have a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a>. The Western and the Central parts experience hot and arid summers reaching up to 40 °C while in the winter, temperatures are below freezing with lots of snow. The north-eastern region has a typical continental climate.

Various archaeological artifacts including relicts of mining activities and tools belonging to similar age groups, provide an indication of the geographical distribution, scale and methods of mining activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> to <a href="Roman%20era">Roman era</a>.

Most important of these is the so-called area of “central Bosnian mountains” located between the rivers <a href="Vrbas%20%28river%29">Vrbas</a>, <a href="La%C5%A1va">Lašva</a>, <a href="Neretva">Neretva</a>, <a href="Rama">Rama</a> and their tributaries. The second one is the area of western Bosnia, bordered by the Vrbas and <a href="Una%20%28Sava%29">Una</a> rivers, with its main orebearing formations found in the river-valleys of <a href="Sana">Sana</a> and Japra, and their tributaries. The third area is eastern Bosnia, around the river <a href="Drina">Drina</a> between the towns of <a href="Fo%C4%8Da">Foča</a> and <a href="Zvornik">Zvornik</a>, the principal mining activity centered around <a href="Srebrenica">Srebrenica</a>.

Ores of various metals, including iron, are found in these areas and exploitation has been going on for more than 5000 years – from the period of prehistoric human settlers, through <a href="Illyrians">Illyrian</a>, Roman, Slavic, <a href="Turkish%20people">Turkish</a> and Austrian rulers, into the present.

However, academics Hilary Footitt and Michael Kelly note that the <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Agreement</a> states that it is "done in <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a>, <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a>, English and <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a>", and they describe this as the "de facto recognition of three official languages" at the state level. The equal status of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian was verified by the Constitutional Court in 2000. It ruled that the provisions of the Federation and Republika Srpska constitutions on language were incompatible with the state constitution, since they only recognised "Bosniak" and Croatian (in the case of the Federation) and Serbian (in the case of Republika Srpska) as official languages at the entity level. As a result, the wording of the entity constitutions was changed and all three languages were made official in both entities. The three languages are <a href="Mutual%20intelligibility">mutually intelligible</a> and are also known collectively as <a href="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a>. Use of one of the three varieties has become a marker of ethnic identity. Michael Kelly and Catherine Baker argue: "The three official languages of today's Bosnian state...represent the symbolic assertion of national identity over the pragmatism of mutual intelligibility". All standard varieties are based on the <a href="Ijekavian">Ijekavian</a> varieties of the <a href="Shtokavian%20dialect">Shtokavian dialect</a> (non-standard spoken varieties including, beside Ijekavian, also Ikavian Shtokavian). Serbian is written in both Latin and <a href="Serbian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic</a>, whereas Croatian and Bosnian are written only in <a href="Gaj%27s%20Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>. There are also some speakers of Italian, German, Turkish and Ladino. <a href="Yugoslav%20Sign%20Language">Yugoslav Sign Language</a> is used with Croatian and Serbian variants.

According to the results of the 2013 census, 52.86% of the population consider their mother tongue to be Bosnian, 30.76% Serbian, 14.6% Croatian and 1.57% another language, with 0.21% not giving an answer.

According to the 2013 census, 50.7% of the population identify religiously as <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>, 30.75% as <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox">Serbian Orthodox</a> Christian, 15.19% as <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, 1.15% as other, 1.1% as agnostic or atheist, with the remainder not declaring their religion or not answering. A 2012 survey found that 54% of Bosnia's Muslims are <a href="non-denominational%20Muslim">non-denominational Muslim</a>s, while 38% follow <a href="Sunnism">Sunnism</a>.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina religion is strongly linked to ethnicity.

Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina

Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina takes place in a framework of a <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary</a> <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democracy</a>, whereby <a href="executive%20power">executive power</a> is exercised by the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the Council of Ministers and the <a href="Parliamentary%20Assembly%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. Members of the Parliamentary Assembly are chosen according to a <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> system.

The <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature. The system of government established by the <a href="Dayton%20Accord">Dayton Accord</a> is an example of <a href="consociationalism">consociationalism</a>, as representation is by elites who represent the country's three major <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a>s termed "constituent peoples", with each having a guaranteed share of power.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into two "Entities" – the <a href="Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and the <a href="Republika%20Srpska">Republika Srpska</a>, which are politically autonomous to an extent, as well as the district of <a href="Br%C4%8Dko%20District">Brčko</a>, which is jointly administered by both. The Entities have their own constitutions.

Due to the <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Agreement</a>, signed on 14 December 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina forms an <a href="Declaration%20%28law%29">undeclared</a> <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> with elements of <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a> by neighboring <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> as co-signatories to the Agreement, where highest power is given to the <a href="High%20Representative%20for%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. The intention of the Agreement was to retain Bosnia's exterior border, while creating a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government based on proportional representation similar to the former socialist régime, and charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal policy.

The Dayton Agreement established the Office of the <a href="High%20Representative%20for%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">High Representative</a> (OHR) to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. About 250 international and 450 local staff members are employed by the OHR.

The highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief executive officer for the international civilian presence in the country. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected Parliamentary Assembly or to remove officials from office without due process. The methods selected by the High Representative are often seen as dictatorship. Even the symbols of Bosnian statehood (flag, coat of arms) have been chosen by the High Representative rather than by the Bosnian people. The source of the authority of the High Representative is in <a href="international%20law">international law</a> while his role is essentially contractual. His mandate derives from the Dayton Agreement, as confirmed by the <a href="Peace%20Implementation%20Council">Peace Implementation Council</a>, a body with a Steering Board composed of representatives of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the <a href="presidency%20of%20the%20European%20Union">presidency of the European Union</a>, the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>, and the <a href="Organisation%20of%20Islamic%20Cooperation">Organisation of Islamic Cooperation</a>.

The Chair of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> rotates amongst three members (a <a href="Bosniaks">Bosniak</a>, a <a href="Serb">Serb</a>, and a <a href="Croat">Croat</a>) every 8 months within their 4-year term. The three members of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Presidency</a> are elected directly by the people, with Federation voters electing both the Bosniak and the Croat member, and Republika Srpska voters electing the Serb member. The Presidency serves as a collective <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>. The Presidency is mainly responsible for the <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign policy</a> and proposing the <a href="budget">budget</a>.

The Prime Minister, formally titled <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He appoints the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Foreign Trade and other ministers as may be appropriate (no more than two thirds of the ministers may be appointed from the territory of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), who assume the office upon the approval by the House of Representatives; also, the Chair appoints deputy ministers (who may not be from the same constituent people as their ministers), who assume the office upon the approval by the House of Representatives.

The Council is responsible for carrying out policies and decisions in the fields of diplomacy, economy, inter-entity relations and other matters as agreed by the entities.

The two Entities have Governments that deal with internal matters not dealt with by the Council of Ministers.

The Parliamentary Assembly or "Parliamentarna skupština" is the main legislative body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of <a href="bicameralism">two chambers</a>:

The Parliamentary Assembly is responsible for:

Bosnia and Herzegovina did not have a permanent <a href="election%20law">election law</a> until 2001, during which time a draft law specified four-year terms for the state and first-order administrative division entity legislatures. The final election law was passed and publicized on 9 September 2001.

The House of Peoples includes 15 delegates who serve two-year terms. Two-thirds of delegates come from the Federation (5 Croats and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). Nine constitutes a quorum in the House of Peoples, provided that at least three delegates from each group are present. Federation representatives are selected by the House of Peoples of the Federation, which has 58 seats (17 Bosniak, 17 Croat, 17 Serb, 7 others), and whose members are delegated by cantonal assemblies to serve four-year terms. Republika Srpska representatives are selected by the 28-member Republika Srpska Council of Peoples, which was established in the People's Assembly of Republika Srpska; each constituent people has eight delegates, while four delegates are representatives of "others".

The <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> comprises 42 members elected under a system of <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> (PR) for a four-year term. Two thirds of the members are elected from the Federation (14 Croats; 14 Bosniaks) and one third from the Republika Srpska (14 Serbs).

For the <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 elections</a>, Voters in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina elected twenty-one members in five multi-member constituencies by PR, while the remaining seven seats were allocated by compensatory PR. Voters in the Republika Srpska elected nine members in three multi-member constituencies by PR, while the five other seats were allocated by compensatory PR.

The <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> is supposedly the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters, however its decisions are largely ignored. The court is composed of nine members: four selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the People's Assembly of Republika Srpska, and three are foreign citizens appointed by the President of the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> after courtesy-consultation with the Presidency.

The initial term of appointee is 5 years, unless they resign or are removed by consensus of other judges. Appointed judges are not eligible for reappointment. Judges subsequently appointed will serve until the age of 70, unless they resign sooner or are removed. Appointments made 5 years into the initial appointments may be governed by a different regulation for selection, to be determined by the Parliamentary Assembly.

Proceedings of the Court are public, and decisions are published. Court rules are adopted by a majority in the Court. Court decisions are final and supposedly binding though this is not always the case, as noted.

The Constitutional Court has jurisdiction over deciding in constitutional disputes that arise between the Entities or amongst Bosnia and Herzegovina and an Entity or Entities. Such disputes may be referred only by a member of the Presidency, the Chair of the Council of Ministers, the Chair or Deputy Chair of either of the chambers of the Parliamentary Assembly, or by one-fourth of the legislature of either Entity.

The Court also has appellate jurisdiction within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The <a href="State%20Court%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> consists of three divisions – Administrative, Appellate and Criminal – having jurisdiction over cases related to the state-level law and executive, as well as appellate jurisdiction over cases initiated in the entities.

A War Crimes Chamber was introduced in January 2005, and has adopted two cases transferred from the ICTY, as well as dozens of war crimes cases originally initiated in cantonal courts.

The State Court also deals with organized crime, and economic crime including corruption cases. For example, the former and 2014 member-elect of the Presidency <a href="Dragan%20%C4%8Covi%C4%87">Dragan Čović</a> is currently on trial for alleged involvement in organized crime.

The <a href="Human%20Rights%20Chamber%20for%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> ("Dom za ljudska prava za Bosnu i Hercegovinu") existed between March 1996 and 31 December 2003. It was a judicial body established under the Annex 6 to the <a href="General%20Framework%20Agreement%20for%20Peace%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> (<a href="Dayton%20Peace%20Agreement">Dayton Peace Agreement</a>).

The two Entities have Supreme Courts. Each entity also has a number of lower courts. There are 10 cantonal courts in the Federation, along with a number of municipal courts. The Republika Srpska has five municipal courts.

Economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina

This page discusses the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina since <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>'s declaration of sovereignty in October 1991 and the declaration of independence from the former <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> on 3 March 1992.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is an upper middle-income country which has accomplished a great deal since the mid-1990s. Today, it is an EU potential candidate country and is now embarking on a new growth model amid a period of slow growth and the global financial crisis. The key economic challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the imbalance of its economic model: public policies and incentives are skewed toward the public rather than the private sector, consumption rather than investment, and imports rather than exports. The country needs to shift to a business environment that is conducive to private investment. The country faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing liberty market reforms to its economy. One legacy of the previous era is strong metal industry; under former republic premier <a href="D%C5%BEemal%20Bijedi%C4%87">Džemal Bijedić</a>, and Yugoslav president <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Tito</a>, metal-product industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's metal products plants. Although agriculture is almost all in private hands, the republic traditionally is an exporter of food. Industry was very strong, a holdover from the Mixed economic structure of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito had pushed the development of metal industries, and electro-energetic sector, in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina were a host of large numbers of industrial firms. Some of them were worked with World brand names, companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, Volkswagen and SKF. Big Companies like Energoinvest, UNIS, Hidrogradnja, Vranica, RMK Zenica, TAS Sarajevo, FAMOS Sarajevo and BNT Novi Travnik, have yearly income in billions of USD$ in that time. Building sector companies bringing large amounts of income in USD$. Unemployment in that time is very low. Work force is highly skilled, with highly professional, educated managers, engineers, science experts, which use western world's newest technologies in large scale areas. Before the war, Yugoslav premier <a href="Ante%20Markovi%C4%87">Ante Marković</a>, made some preparations for privatization, in economy, finance, and industry sectors, but the war ceased development in these actions.

The <a href="war%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">war in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> caused production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995 and unemployment to soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996–99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000–02. Part of the lag in output was made up in 2003–05. National-level statistics are limited and do not capture the large share of black market activity.

The <a href="konvertibilna%20marka">konvertibilna marka</a> (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however, has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all ; foreign banks, primarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A sizable current account deficit and very high unemployment rate remain the two most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.

The United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces the Country Commercial Guide – an annual report that delivers a comprehensive look at Bosnia and Herzegovina's commercial and economic environment, using economic, political, and market analysis. It can be viewed on <a href="http%3A//sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html">Embassy Sarajevo's website</a>.

As of October 2012, the IMF has approved a two-year stand-by arrangement of 405.3 million euro for Bosnia. The IMF loan, approved on September 26, is designed to support Bosnia's economic programme for the next two years, ease the effects of the "external environment and address domestic structural weaknesses". Bosnia's two autonomous entities will be using the cash from the loan but will not get the whole amount at once. The IMF has enabled an initial disbursement of 60.8 million euro, saying that the rest of the money will be spread out over two years, after successful quarterly reviews.

The economy was slowed, because of destruction in the War. The Industry, what is left, reflecting the rigidity of the liberal market economy, after the war. Under President Tito, metal industries were pushed in the republic; Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia metal industry - Bosnia was in the center of metal industry in former Yugoslavia.

<a href="History%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%2319th%20and%2020th%20century">During the Bosnian war for independence</a> (1992–1995) much of the economy and infrastructure in Bosnia was damaged or destroyed, causing unemployment to soar.

Bosnia has been facing a dual challenge: to rebuild the infrastructure, and to finish the transition from self-govern socialism to liberal market capitalism.

With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996–98 at high percentage rates on a low base; but output growth slowed appreciably in 1999, and GDP remains far below the 1990 level.

Economic data are of limited use because, although <a href="Political%20divisions%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">both entities</a> issue figures, national-level statistics are not available. Moreover, official data do not capture the large share of activity that occurs on the <a href="black%20market">black market</a>. The <a href="Grey%20market">Grey market</a> is a notable source of income for Bosnian traders.

A Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in late 1997, debt negotiations were held with the <a href="London%20Club">London Club</a> in December 1997 and with the <a href="Paris%20Club">Paris Club</a> in October 1998, and a new currency, the <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20convertible%20mark">Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark</a>, was introduced in mid-1998. In 1999, the Convertible Mark gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank dramatically increased its reserve holdings.

Due to Bosnia's strict currency board regime attaching the Bosnian mark to the Euro, <a href="inflation">inflation</a> has remained low in the entire country.

The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and <a href="humanitarian%20aid">humanitarian aid</a> from the international community. Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) assistance accounts for 20%-25% of <a href="economic%20growth">economic growth</a> in Bosnia.

However, growth has been uneven throughout the post-war period, with the Federation outpacing the RS. According to World Bank estimates, GDP growth was 62% in the Federation and 25% in the RS in 1996, 35% in the Federation and flat in the RS in 1997, and continued growth in the Federation in 1998.

Movement has been slow, but considerable progress has been made in economic reform since peace was re-established in the republic. <a href="Banking">Banking</a> reform lagged, as did the implementation of <a href="privatization">privatization</a>. Many companies (mainly factories) that were privatized faced massive problems, causing the owners to reduce salaries and deny the workers their salaries, and some of the new owners and tycoons destroy that factories.

Sarajevo has a strong tourist industry and was named by <a href="Lonely%20Planet">Lonely Planet</a> one of the top 50 "Best Cities in the World" in 2006. Sports-related tourism uses the legacy facilities of the 1984 Winter Olympics, especially the skiing facilities on the nearby mountains of <a href="Bjela%C5%A1nica%20Mountain">Bjelašnica</a>, <a href="Igman">Igman</a>, <a href="Jahorina">Jahorina</a>, <a href="Trebevi%C4%87">Trebević</a>, and <a href="Treskavica">Treskavica</a>. Sarajevo's 600 years of history, influenced by both Western and Eastern empires, is also a strong <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>. Sarajevo has hosted travellers for centuries, because it was an important trading center during the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> and <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungarian</a> empires.

Today, Sarajevo is one of the fastest developing cities in the region. Various new modern buildings have been built, most significantly the <a href="Bosmal%20City%20Center">Bosmal City Center</a>, BBI Center and the Avaz Twist Tower which is the tallest skyscraper in the Balkans. A new highway was recently (2006–2011) completed between Sarajevo and the city of Kakanj. 
Due to growth in population, tourism and airport traffic the service sector in the city is developing fast and welcoming new investors from various businesses.

Sarajevo has one of the most representable commercial infrastructures in South-East Europe. The Sarajevo City Center is one of the biggest shopping centres in South-East Europe, after its completion in 2014. Airport Center Sarajevo which will be connected directly to the new airport terminal will offer a great variety of brands, products and services.

In 1981 Sarajevo's GDP per capita was 133% of the Yugoslav average.

In 2011 Sarajevo's GDP is estimated to be 16.76 billion US$ by the Central Bank of Bosnia, which compromises 37% of the total GDP of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<a href="Mostar">Mostar</a>'s economy relies heavily on tourism, aluminum and metal industry, banking services and telecommunication sector. The city is the seat of some of the country's largest corporations.

Along with Sarajevo, it is the largest financial center in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with two out of three largest banks in the country having their headquarters in Mostar. Bosnia-Herzegovina has three national electric, postal and telecommunication service corporations; These three companies banks and the aluminium factory make a vast portion of overall economic activity in the city.

<a href="Aluminij">Aluminij</a> is one of the most influential companies in the city, region, but also country. In relation to the current manufacturing capacity it generates an annual export of more than <a href="Euro">€</a>150 million.

It has a developed financial sector, 11 international banks are represented, 5 microcredit organizations and a foundation for development.
The city's huge economic potential is in the strategic geographical location being close to Zagreb, Belgrade, Budapest and Vienna. Giving it one of the best climates for economic expansion in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The agricultural land around the city, raw minerals in the municipality and growth of high educated population in the city proper gives it a unique combination of both being able to produce sophisticated industrial products, food and service branches.

Plowed fields and gardens take up 340.26 hectares, orchards 23.86 hectares and vineyards 5 hectares.

The service sector in Prijedor is growing rapidly and this reflects in the growth of hotels, stores, roads, educational facilities and shoppings centers that are being built in the city. Making it a growing commercial hub in Bosnia and Hercegovina.

Although the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. For four years, Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established <a href="Banja%20Luka%20Stock%20Exchange">Banja Luka Stock Exchange</a>. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as <a href="Telekom%20Srpske">Telekom Srpske</a>, Rafinerija ulja Modriča, <a href="Banjalu%C4%8Dka%20Pivara">Banjalučka Pivara</a> and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, now include a number of investment funds from the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="China">China</a>.

A number of financial services regulators, such as the <a href="Republika%20Srpska%20Securities%20Commission">Republika Srpska Securities Commission</a> and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the <a href="Value-added%20tax">Value-added tax</a> (VAT) Authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.

In 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.
The <a href="tourism">tourism</a> sector has been recovering and helping the economy altogether in the process, with popular winter skiing destinations as well as summer countryside tourism. 
<a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> has been a top performer in recent years in terms of <a href="tourism">tourism</a> development; tourist arrivals have grown by an average of 24% annually from 1995 to 2000. The European region's solid growth in arrivals in 2007 was due in significant part to Southern and Mediterranean Europe's strong performance (+7%). 
In particular, Bosnia and Herzegovina were among the stronger players with a growth of 20%.

In 2012, Bosnia-Herzegovina had 747.827 tourists an increase of 9% and 1.645.521 overnight stays which is an 9,4% increase from 2012. 
58,6% of the tourists came from foreign countries.

According to an estimate of the <a href="World%20Tourism%20Organization">World Tourism Organization</a>, <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> will have the third highest tourism growth rate in the world between 1995 and 2020.

Of particular note is the <a href="diaspora">diaspora</a> population which often returns home during the summer months, bringing in an increase in retail sales and food service industry.

While <a href="Commercial%20law">business regulations</a> are of comparable strictness as in most countries in Central Europe, still contains many problems inherited from country's post war high percentage of unemployment ( 44,6%), and the economical progress is very slow, and too comlicated bureaucracy system, Complex procedures and often misconducted audition and regulation by <a href="Tax%20inspector">public officers</a> also make for volatile and insecure business environment, which is considered major hindrance to <a href="foreign%20direct%20investment">foreign investment</a> into the country's industrial and manufacturing potential.

The workforce is comparably cheap, with average net salary being €215, and average gross salary being €344, and good skilled, especially in sectors present in pre-war economy. However, with slow but persistent <a href="know-how">know-how</a> obsolescence, <a href="Brain-drain">workforce exodus</a>, high <a href="unemployment">unemployment</a> and long average time outside labor market for the unemployed, need a foreign-owned business investing in <a href="industry%20sector">industry sector</a>s where the country could be <a href="Competitiveness">competitive</a> .

Bosnia-Herzegovina is also lacking a good <a href="E-Governance">E-governance</a> structure as well as good methods to enforce <a href="administrative%20accountability">administrative accountability</a>, both of which are considered necessary for more conductive business climate. Today it takes between 3–5 weeks to register a company in the country (and in some business sectors it can still take months to acquire all required permits, mostly due to <a href="Red%20tape">administrative inefficiency</a>), and many other business related administrative procedures are similarly convoluted and time-consuming.

<a href="Political%20corruption">Political corruption</a> is one of the more acute problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and along with <a href="Public%20administration">size of administration</a> and it's inefficiency, the biggest detriment to tax money being spent where it should be spent - on services to the population and the economy.

Bosnia has been preparing for an era of declining international assistance. Country's most immediate task remains economic revitalization to create jobs and <a href="income">income</a>. After the <a href="2014%20unrest%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">2014 riots</a>, <a href="Bosnian%20general%20election%2C%202010">both</a> <a href="Bosnian%20general%20election%2C%202014">administrations</a> have shyly started the reform, dealing with some of the many pressing issues to local economy, but the overall process is still considered slow and tenuous by the populace and local as well as foreign economic analysts.

The Bosnian government has issued an international tender for the construction of the 350 km long Corridor 5c in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will passes along the route Budapest-Osijek-Sarajevo-Ploče. The highway along this corridor is the most significant roadway in B&H and the shortest communication route between Central Europe and the Southern Adriatic. The routing of the road passes through the central part of the country in the North-South direction from Donji Svilaj to the border of B&H, north from the Croatian <a href="port%20of%20Plo%C4%8De">port of Ploče</a>, following the rivers Bosna and Neretva. More than 50% of the total population and the economic activity of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies within the zone of influence along this route.

So far in Bosnia, 83 km motorway has been completed and 117 km is under construction. (April 2013) 

Due to annual growth of nearly 10% the <a href="Sarajevo%20International%20Airport">Sarajevo International Airport</a> extension of the passenger terminal, together with upgrading and expanding the taxiway and apron is planned to start in Fall 2012. The existing terminal will be expanded with 7.000 square metres. 
The upgraded airport will also be directly connected to the commercial retail center Sarajevo Airport Center 
making it easy for tourist and travellers to use the time before the flight for some last minute shopping.

Bosnia & Herzegovina is well connected to other countries in Europe. The main bus station of Sarajevo has its own website. The main provider of international bus connection in Bosnia & Herzegovina is Eurolines. There are routes to Croatia, Germany, Austria, France, Netherlands, Montenegro, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Serbia. Despite Bosnia & Herzegovina's geographical closeness to Serbia, there is only one bus a day, which takes more than 8 hours due to the lack of proper roads.

Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina

The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina (<a href="Serbo-Croat-Bosnian">Serbo-Croat-Bosnian</a>: "Oružane snage Bosne i Hercegovine, OSBIH"/Оружане снаге Босне и Херцеговине, ОСБИХ) is the official <a href="military">military</a> force of <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. The BiH Armed forces were officially unified in 2005 and are composed of two founding <a href="army">armies</a>: the <a href="Bosniaks">Bosniak</a>-<a href="Bosnian%20Croat">Croat</a> <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and the <a href="Bosnian%20Serb">Bosnian Serb</a> <a href="Army%20of%20Republika%20Srpska">Army of Republika Srpska</a>.

The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, founded in 2004, is in charge of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In accordance with the BiH Constitution (Article 5.5a), BiH Law of defense and BiH Law of service the supreme civilian commander of the Armed Forces Bosnia and Herzegovina is the collective Presidency of <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. The collective Presidency directs the Ministry of defense BiH and the Armed Forces. Former Bosnia and Herzegovina ministers of defense include H.E. Nikola Radovanović, H.E. Selmo Cikotić and H.E. Muhamed Ibrahimović. The current Minister of defense BiH is H.E. Marina Pendeš. Former Chiefs of Joint Staff AF BiH include LGEN Sifet Podžić and Lieutenant General Miladin Milojčić. The current BiH Chief of Joint Staff is Lieutenant General Anto Jeleč. <a href="Conscription">Conscription</a> was completely abolished in Bosnia and Herzegovina effective on and from 1 January 2006.

The Bosnia and Herzegovina Defence Law addresses the following areas: the Military of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Government Institutions, Entity Jurisdictions and Structure, Budget and Financing, Composition of Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, War Declaration, natural disasters, conflict of interests and professionalism, Oath to Bosnia-Herzegovina, flags, anthem and military insignia, and transitional and end orders.

The AFBiH was formed from three armies of the <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian War</a> period: the Bosnian (dominantly Bosniak with numbers of Serbs and Croats) <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, the Bosnian Serb <a href="Army%20of%20Republika%20Srpska">Army of Republika Srpska</a>, and the <a href="Croat%20Defence%20Council">Croat Defence Council</a>.

The Army of the Republic of Bosnia And Herzegovina was created on 15 April 1992 during the early days of the <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian War</a>. Before the ARBiH was formally created, there existed <a href="Territorial%20Defence%20Force%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Territorial Defence</a>, an official military force of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a number of <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> groups such as the <a href="Zelene%20beretke">Green Berets</a>, <a href="Patriotic%20League%20%28Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%29">Patriotic League</a>, and <a href="civil%20defense">civil defense</a> groups, as well as many criminal gangs and collections of police and military professionals. The army was formed under poor circumstances, with a very low number of <a href="tanks">tanks</a>, <a href="Armored%20Personnel%20Carrier">APC</a>s and no military aviation assets. The army was divided into Corps, each Corp was stationed in a territory. The first commander was <a href="Sefer%20Halilovi%C4%87">Sefer Halilović</a>.

The Army of Republika Srpska was created on 12 May 1992. Before the VRS was formally created, there were a number of <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> groups such as the Srpska Dobrovoljačka Garda, <a href="White%20Eagles%20%28paramilitary%29">Beli Orlovi</a>, as well as some <a href="Russians">Russian</a>, <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> and other volunteers. The army was equipped with ex-<a href="Yugoslav%20People%27s%20Army">JNA</a> inventory. It had about 200 tanks, mostly <a href="T-55">T-55</a>s and 85 <a href="M-84">M-84</a>s, and 150 APCs with several heavy artillery pieces. The Air Defense of VRS has shot down several aircraft, like <a href="F-16">F-16</a>, <a href="Mirage%202000">Mirage 2000</a>, <a href="F-18">F-18</a> and one <a href="Croatian%20Air%20Force">Croatian Air Force</a> <a href="MiG-21">MiG-21</a>. The VRS received support from the <a href="Yugoslav%20Army">Yugoslav Army</a> and <a href="FRY">FRY</a>.

The <a href="Croatian%20Defence%20Council">Croatian Defence Council</a> was the main military formation of the <a href="Croatian%20Republic%20of%20Herzeg-Bosnia">Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia</a> during the Bosnian War. It was first organized military force to with the aim to control the Croat populated areas, created on 8 April 1992. They ranged from men armed with shotguns assigned to <a href="Croatian%20Defence%20Council%23Village%20Guards">village defense tasks</a> to organized, uniformed, and well-equipped <a href="Croatian%20Defence%20Council%23Guard%20brigades">brigade-sized formations</a> that nevertheless employed <a href="Croatian%20Defence%20Council%23Home%20Guard">part-time soldiers</a>. As time went on, the HVO forces became increasingly better organized and more "professional", but it was not until early 1994, that the HVO began to form the so-called <a href="Croatian%20Defence%20Council%23Guard%20brigades">guards brigades</a>, mobile units manned by full-time professional soldiers.

In 1995–96, a <a href="NATO">NATO</a>-led international peacekeeping force (<a href="IFOR">IFOR</a>) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning on December 21, 1995 to implement and monitor the military aspects of the <a href="Dayton%20Peace%20Agreement">Dayton Peace Agreement</a>. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force or <a href="SFOR">SFOR</a>. The number of SFOR troops was reduced first to 12,000 and then to 7,000. SFOR was in turn succeeded by an even smaller, <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>-led European Union Force, <a href="EUFOR%20Althea">EUFOR Althea</a>. , EUFOR Althea numbered around 7,000 troops.

The restructuring of the three armies into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents part of a wider process of 'thickening' the central state institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to mitigate some of the potential controversy around restructuring, the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20High%20Representative">Office of the High Representative</a> (OHR) made use of evidence of malpractice in Republika Srpska military institutions. Firstly, from 2002 onwards, OHR utilised a scandal around the provision of parts and assistance to Iraq in breach of a UN embargo (the so-called Orao affair) to support the cause for bringing governance of the armies under the level of central institutions. Following this, in 2004, the process was accelerated, drawing its justification from new evidence of material and other forms of support flowing from Republika Srpska armed forces to ICTY indictee <a href="Ratko%20Mladi%C4%87">Ratko Mladić</a>. OHR condemned the ‘systematic connivance of high-ranking members of the RS military’ and noted that measures to tackle such systematic deficiencies were under consideration. This was quickly followed by the expansion of the mandate for a Defence Reform Commission, which ultimately resulted in the consolidation of three armed forces into one, governed at the level of the central state.

As the joint AFBiH began to develop, troops began to be sent abroad. Bosnia and Herzegovina deployed a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel as part of the <a href="Multinational%20force%20in%20Iraq">Multinational force in Iraq</a>. The unit was first deployed to <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a>, then <a href="Talil%20Air%20Base">Talil Air Base</a>, and is now located at <a href="Camp%20Echo%20%28Iraq%29">Camp Echo</a>. In December 2006, the Bosnian government formerly extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th Infantry Division to Iraq in August 2008, their mission will be to protect/guard <a href="Camp%20Victory">Camp Victory</a> in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>.

The Military units are commanded by the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina Joint Staff in Sarajevo. There are two major commands under the Joint Staff: Operational Command and Support Command.

There are three regiments that are each formed by soldiers from the three ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs and trace their roots to the armies that were created during the war in BiH. These regiments have their distinct ethnic insignias and consist of three active battalions each. Headquarters of <a href="Regiment">Regiment</a>s have no operational authority. On the basis of the Law on Service in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the regimental headquarters have the following tasks: to manage the regimental museum, monitor financial fund Regiment, prepare, investigate and cherish the history of the regiment, the regiment publish newsletters, maintain cultural and historical heritage, give guidance on holding special ceremonies, give guidance on customs, dress and deportment Regiment, conduct officer, NCO and military clubs. Each regiments three battalions divided evenly between the three active brigades of the Army.

Within the armed forces, there are a number of services. These include a Technical Service, Air Technology service, Military Police service, Communications service, Sanitary service, a Veterans service, Civilian service, Financial service, Information service, Legal service, Religious service, and a Musical service.

Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were unified in 2005 and at that time they needed a uniform for the newly founded army. <a href="MARPAT">MARPAT</a> was designated as the future uniform of AFBIH.

Insignia is found on military hats or berets, on the right and left shoulder on the uniform of all Soldiers of the Armed Forces. All, except for generals, wear badges on their hats or berets with either the land force badge or air force badge. Generals wear badges with the coat of arms of Bosnia surrounded with branches and two swords.All soldiers of the armed forces have on their right shoulder a flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All members of the three regiments wear their regiment insignia on the left shoulder. There are other insignias, brigades or other institution are worn under the regiment insignia. The name of the soldiers is worn on the left part of the chest while the name "Armed Forces of BiH" is worn on the right part of the chest.

The Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and the <a href="Republika%20Srpska%20Air%20Force">Republika Srpska Air Force</a> were merged in 2006. The status of the <a href="Air%20Force">Air Force</a> in the last couple of years, has merged a great success. While saying so, it includes aircraft repairs, funds for professional and proper cooperation with the <a href="Ground%20Forces">Ground Forces</a>, as well as to the citizens of the country. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> is in great interest of buying new aircraft's, that include mostly helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.

Exports of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Canada are worth about <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a> 5.31 million per year, while exports of Canada to Bosnia and Herzegovina value about US$5.34 million per year.

Discussions continue with <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> on several small disputed sections of the boundary related to maritime access that hinder final ratification of the 1999 border agreement.

Sections of the <a href="Una%20%28Sava%29">Una</a> river and villages at the base of Mount <a href="Plje%C5%A1evica">Plješevica</a> are in Croatia, while some are in Bosnia, which causes an excessive number of border crossings on a single route and impedes any serious development in the region. The <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>-<a href="Biha%C4%87">Bihać</a>-<a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split</a> railway line is still closed for major traffic due to this issue. The road <a href="Karlovac">Karlovac</a>-<a href="Plitvice%20Lakes">Plitvice Lakes</a>-<a href="Knin">Knin</a>, which is on the <a href="European%20route">European route</a> E71, is becoming increasingly unused because Croatia built a separate highway to the west of it.

The border on the Una river between <a href="Hrvatska%20Kostajnica">Hrvatska Kostajnica</a> on the northern, Croatian side of the river, and <a href="Bosanska%20Kostajnica">Bosanska Kostajnica</a> on the southern, Bosnian side, is also being discussed. A river island between the two towns is under Croatian control, but is claimed by Bosnia. A shared border crossing point has been built and has been functioning since 2003, and is used without hindrance by either party.

The Herzegovinian <a href="municipality">municipality</a> of <a href="Neum">Neum</a> in the south makes the southernmost part of Croatia an <a href="exclave">exclave</a> and the two countries are negotiating special transit rules through Neum to compensate for that. Recently Croatia has opted to build a <a href="Pelje%C5%A1ac%20bridge">bridge to the Pelješac peninsula</a> to connect the Croatian mainland with the exclave but Bosnia and Herzegovina has protested that the bridge will close its access to <a href="international%20waters">international waters</a> (although Croatian territory and <a href="territorial%20waters">territorial waters</a> surround Bosnian-Herzegovinian territory and waters completely) and has suggested that the bridge must be higher than 55 meters for free passage of all types of ships.

Germany was closely involved in efforts to bring about peace before and after the conclusion of the <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Agreement</a>. There is also a long tradition of economic relations between Germany and Bosnia. When the country was still part of the former Yugoslavia, joint ventures and cooperation played a large role here (motor industry, metal processing, textile industry/contract processing work, steel and chemicals). After the war, Germany took on a spearheading role in investments in production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is undergoing a transitional phase from a centrally planned to a market economy. These investments are concentrated primarily in vehicle assembly and parts supply, the construction industry/cement, raw materials processing/ aluminum and regional dairy farming.

Relations between Bosnia and Macedonia have mostly been very successful. The two countries first shared the same 90s objective of pursuing independence from Yugoslavia, and in the 21st century, the common objective of joining the EU and NATO.

Malaysia, under Prime Minister <a href="Mahathir%20bin%20Mohamad">Mahathir bin Mohamad</a>, had been one of the strongest supporters of the Bosnian cause during the war and the only Asian country that accept Bosnian refugees. Malaysia sent UN Peacekeeping troops to the former Yugoslavia. Malaysia maintains a number of investments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the most significant is the <a href="Bosmal%20City%20Center">Bosmal Group</a>. Bosmal is a joint venture set up between Malaysian and Bosnian interests. A number of Bosnian students are currently studying at the <a href="International%20Islamic%20University%20Malaysia">International Islamic University Malaysia</a> in <a href="Gombak">Gombak</a>.

Pakistan and Bosnia and Herzegovina enjoy close and cordial relations. Pakistan recognised the independence of Bosnia from Yugoslavia in 1992. Pakistan sent in UN Peacekeeping forces to the former Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav wars. During the war, Pakistan supported Bosnia while providing technical and military support to Bosnia. Pakistan and Bosnia have a free trade agreement. During the War time, Pakistan had hosted thousands of Bosnians as refugees in Pakistan. Pakistan has also provided medium-tech to high Tech weapons to Bosnian Government in the past.

Romania recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina’s independence on 1 March 1996, both countries established diplomatic relations on the same day. Bosnia and Herzegovina has an embassy in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>. Romania has an embassy in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>. Relations were described as "excellent" by the foreign ministers in 2006, ahead of the opening of the Bosnian embassy in Bucharest.

Bosnia is one of the countries where Russia has contributed troops for the NATO-led stabilization force. Others were sent to Kosovo and Serbia.

Saudi Arabia has provided enormous financial assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina since its independence in 1992. Saudi interests also funded for the construction of the <a href="King%20Fahd%20Mosque%20%28Sarajevo%29">King Fahd Mosque</a>, which is currently the largest mosque in Sarajevo. Bosnia and Herzegovina maintains an embassy in <a href="Riyadh">Riyadh</a> and Saudi Arabia maintains an embassy in Sarajevo.

Bosnia and Herzegovina filed a suit against the <a href="Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> (present-day <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>) before the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court of Justice</a> for aggression and genocide during the <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian War</a> which was dismissed and Serbia was found innocent. Sections along the <a href="Drina%20River">Drina River</a> remain in dispute between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.

Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Korea were established diplomatic relations on December 15, 1995.

Turkey provided both political and financial support to Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war. After the war, relations have improved even more, and today Turkey is one of BiH's top foreign investors and business partners.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has an embassy in London. The United Kingdom has an embassy in Sarajevo and an embassy office in Banja Luka.

The 1992-1995 war in <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> was ended with the crucial participation of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in brokering the 1995 <a href="Dayton%20Accords">Dayton Accords</a>. After leading the diplomatic and military effort to secure the Dayton agreement, the United States has continued to lead the effort to ensure its implementation. The United States maintains command of the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> headquarters in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>. The United States has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help with infrastructure, humanitarian aid, economic development, and military reconstruction in Herzegovina and Bosnia. The <a href="U.S.%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">U.S. Agency for International Development</a> (USAID) and Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) has played a large role in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina, including programs in economic development and reform, democratic reform (<a href="Mass%20media">media</a>, <a href="elections">elections</a>), <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a> development, and training programs for Bosnian professionals, among others. Additionally, there are many <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organization</a>s (NGOs) that have likewise played significant roles in the reconstruction.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has no <a href="diplomatic%20relations">diplomatic relations</a> with:

The <a href="accession%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20to%20the%20European%20Union">accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union</a> is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The <a href="Stabilisation%20and%20Association%20Process">Stabilisation and Association Process</a> (SAP) is the EU's policy framework. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, member states of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.

Bosnia and Herzegovina receives support from donor programs of:

In the 3 years since the Dayton Accords were signed, over $4 billion in foreign aid has flown into Bosnia, about $800 million of it coming from SEED funds. As stated above, this support has been key to the growth and revitalization of the economy and infrastructure in the republic. However, most of this aid has been targeted at the Federation; the previous government of the RS was anti-Dayton and not assisted by the U.S. The election of the "Sloga" or "Unity" Coalition government, led by Prime Minister Dodik, has shifted the balance of power in the <a href="Republika%20Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> (RS) to a pro-Dayton stance and will result in an upsurge of funding to the RS from the international community.

In addition to SEED funding, <a href="USAID">USAID</a> programs have been crucial to the redevelopment of Bosnia and Herzegovina. USAID has programming in the following areas: economic policy reform and restructuring; private sector development (the Business Development Program); infrastructure rebuilding; democratic reforms in the media, political process and elections, and rule of law/legal code formulation; and training programs for women and diplomats.

History of Botswana

The <a href="Batswana">Batswana</a>, a term also used to denote all citizens of <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>, refers to the country's major ethnic group (called the <a href="Tswana">Tswana</a> in <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a>). Prior to <a href="European">European</a> contact, the <a href="Batswana">Batswana</a> lived as <a href="herders">herders</a> and farmers under <a href="tribal%20rule">tribal rule</a>.

Sometime between 200-500 AD, the <a href="Bantu">Bantu</a>-speaking people who were living in the <a href="Katanga%20Province">Katanga</a> area (today part of the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">DRC</a> and <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>) crossed the <a href="Limpopo%20River">Limpopo River</a>, entering the area today known as <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> as part of the <a href="Bantu%20expansion">Bantu expansion</a>.

There were 2 broad waves of immigration to South Africa; <a href="Nguni%20people">Nguni</a> and <a href="Sotho">Sotho</a>-<a href="Tswana">Tswana</a>. The former settled in the eastern coastal regions, while the latter settled primarily in the area known today as the <a href="Highveld">Highveld</a> — the large, relatively high central plateau of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.

By <a href="1000AD">1000AD</a> the Bantu colonization of the eastern half of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> had been completed (but not <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a> and <a href="Northern%20Cape">Northern Cape</a>, which are believed to have been inhabited by <a href="Khoisan">Khoisan</a> people until <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> colonisation). The Bantu-speaking society was highly a decentralized feudal society organized on a basis of <a href="kraals">kraals</a> (an enlarged clan), headed by a chief, who owed a very hazy allegiance to the nation's head chief. According to <a href="Neil%20Parsons">Neil Parsons</a>'s online "Brief History of Botswana":

In the late 19th century, hostilities broke out between the <a href="Shona%20people">Shona</a> inhabitants of Botswana and <a href="Southern%20Ndebele%20people">Ndebele</a> tribes who were migrating into the territory from the <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a>. Tensions also escalated with the <a href="Boer">Boer</a> settlers from the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a>. After appeals by the Batswana leaders <a href="Khama%20III">Khama III</a>, Bathoen, and <a href="Sebele%20I">Sebele I</a> for assistance, the British Government on 31 March 1885 put "<a href="Bechuanaland">Bechuanaland</a>" under its protection. The northern territory remained under direct administration as the <a href="Bechuanaland%20Protectorate">Bechuanaland Protectorate</a> and is today's Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the <a href="British%20Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a> and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa; the majority of <a href="Setswana">Setswana</a>-speaking people today live in South Africa. The <a href="Tati%20Concessions%20Land">Tati Concessions Land</a>, formerly part of the <a href="Matabele%20kingdom">Matabele kingdom</a>, was administered from the Bechuanaland Protectorate after 1893, to which it was formally <a href="annexation">annexed</a> in 1911.

When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, <a href="Basutoland">Basutoland</a> (now <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>), and <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a> (the "High Commission Territories") were not included, but provision was made for
their later incorporation. However, a vague undertaking was given to consult their inhabitants, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, Britain kept delaying, and it never occurred. The election of the
National Party government in 1948, which instituted <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>, and South Africa's withdrawal from the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa. 

An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils representing Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regularized tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.

In June 1966, Britain accepted proposals for democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved from <a href="Mafeking">Mafikeng</a> in South Africa, to newly established <a href="Gaborone">Gaborone</a> in 1965. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966. <a href="Seretse%20Khama">Seretse Khama</a>, a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the <a href="Bamangwato">Ngwato</a> chiefship, was elected as the first president, re-elected twice, and died in office in 1980. The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, <a href="Ketumile%20Masire">Ketumile Masire</a>, who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, <a href="Festus%20Mogae">Festus Mogae</a>, who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. In April 2008, Excellency the President Lieutenant General Dr Seretse Khama Ian Khama (<a href="Ian%20Khama">Ian Khama</a>), son of Seretse Khama the first president, succeeded to the presidency when Festus Mogae retired.

All citizens of <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>-regardless of colour, ancestry or tribal affiliation are known as Batswana (plural) or <a href="Motswana">Motswana</a> (singular). In the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of <a href="Tswana">Tswana</a>, tribal groups are usually denoted with the prefix 'ba', which means 'the people of...'.Therefore, the <a href="Herero%20people">Herero</a> are known as <a href="Baherero">Baherero</a>, and the <a href="Kgalagadi">Kgalagadi</a> as <a href="Bakgalagadi">Bakgalagadi</a>, and so on. Botswana's eight major tribes are represented in the <a href="Ntlo%20ya%20Dikgosi">house of chiefs</a>, the country's second legislative body.

Botswana's second largest ethic group are the Bakalanga,another powerful land-owning group who are thought to descend from <a href="Rozwi%20Empire">Rozwi</a>- the culture responsible for building <a href="Great%20Zimbabwe">Great Zimbabwe</a>.In the colonial reshuffle the Bakalanga were split into two and now some 75% of them live in <a href="Zimbabwe">Western Zimbabwe</a>.In <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> they are based mainly, although not exclusively, around <a href="Francistown">Francistown</a>.

The Herero probably originated from the eastern or central Africa and migrated across the <a href="Okavango%20River">Okavango River</a> into northeastern <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> in the early 16th century. In 1884 the Germans took possession of German south west Africa (Namibia) and systematically appropriated Herero grazing lands. The ensuing conflict between the Germans and the Herero was to last for years, only ending in a calculated act of genocide which saw the remaining of the tribe flee across the border into Botswana. The refugees settled among the <a href="Batawana">Batawana</a> and were initially subjugated, but eventually regained their herds and independence. These days the Herero are among the wealthiest <a href="herders">herders</a> in <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>.

The Basubiya, <a href="Wayeyi">Wayeyi</a> and <a href="Mbukushu">Mbukushu</a> are all riverine peoples scattered around the <a href="Chobe%20District">Chobe</a> and <a href="Linyanti%20Constituency">Linyanti</a> rivers and across the <a href="Okavango">Okavango</a> pan-handle.Their histories and migrations are a text book example of the ebb and flow of power and influence. For a long time, the Basubiya were the dominant force, pushing the wayeyi from the <a href="Chobe%20District">Chobe</a> river and into the Okavango after a little spat over a lion skin, so tradition says. The Basubiya were agriculturists and as such proved easy prey for the growing <a href="Lozi%20people">Lozi Empire</a> (from modern <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>), which in turned collapsed in 1865. They still live in the <a href="Chobe%20District">Chobe district</a>.

Originally from the same areas in <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> and Angola as the Mbukushu, the Wyeyi moved south from the Chobe river into the Okavango Delta in the mid-18 century to avoid the growing conflict with the Basubiya.<br>

Geography of Botswana

<a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> is a landlocked country located in Southern <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, north of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> occupies an area of , of which are land.

Much of the population of Botswana is concentrated in the eastern part of the country.

Sunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.

Botswana is semi-arid, due to the short rain season. However, the relatively high altitude of the country and its continental situation gives it a subtropical climate. The country is remote from moisture-laden air flows for most of the year. The dry season lasts from April to October in the south and to November in the north where, however, rainfall totals are higher. The south of the country is most exposed to cold winds during the winter period (early May to late August) when average temperatures are around . The whole country has hot summers with average temperatures around . Sunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.

The land is predominantly flat to gently undulating <a href="tableland">tableland</a>, although there is some hilly country, where mining is carried out. The <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a> is in the central and the southwest. The <a href="Okavango%20Delta">Okavango Delta</a>, one of the world's largest inland deltas, is in the northwest and the <a href="Makgadikgadi%20Pans">Makgadikgadi Pans</a>, a large <a href="Salt%20pan%20%28geology%29">salt pan</a> lies in the north-central area. The Makgadikgadi has been established as an early habitation area for primitive man; This large seasonal <a href="wetland">wetland</a> is composed of several large component pans, the largest being <a href="Nwetwe%20Pan">Nwetwe Pan</a>, <a href="Sua%20Pan">Sua Pan</a> and <a href="Nxai%20Pan">Nxai Pan</a>.

Except for the Chobe, Okavango, <a href="Boteti">Boteti</a> and <a href="Limpopo%20river">Limpopo river</a>s, most of Botswana's rivers cease to flow during the dry and early rainy seasons.

Botswana is affected by periodic droughts, and seasonal August winds blow from the west, carrying sand and dust, which can obscure visibility.

Current environmental issues in Botswana are overgrazing, desertification and the existence of only limited fresh water resources.

Research from the <a href="University%20of%20Botswana">University of Botswana</a> has found that the common practice of <a href="Grazing%23Disadvantages">overstocking cattle</a> to cope with drought losses actually depletes scarce <a href="biomass">biomass</a>, making ecosystems more vulnerable. The study of the Kgatleng district predicts that by 2050 the cycle of mild drought is likely to become shorter —18 months instead of two years—due to <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>.

The seven censuses of Botswana before its independence happened irregularly. Due to the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Anglo-Boer War</a>, the first census of <a href="Bechuanaland%20Protectorate">Bechuanaland Protectorate</a>, originally set to occur in 1901, took place on 17 April 1904. The 1931 census was postponed to 1936 because of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. The early censuses were unreliable and took several years to tabulate; the results were outdated by the time they were calculated.

There have been five censuses after the independence of Botswana, each occurring every ten years in the year ending in 1 (i.e. 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011). The 1971 census was the first census in Botswana to use de facto enumeration; this method counts people based on how many people spent census night at a specific location. Previously, the citizens were counted based on their usual place of residence. The 2001 census was the first census in Botswana to comply with the <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">SADC</a> 2000 Census Project, the guidelines of which unify the demographic statistics in southern <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. The most recent census was the <a href="2011%20Botswana%20Population%20and%20Housing%20Census">2011 Botswana Population and Housing Census</a>, which occurred in August 2011.

The party system has been dominated by the <a href="Botswana%20Democratic%20Party">Botswana Democratic Party</a> (BDP), which has never lost power since independence. The <a href="Judiciary">Judiciary</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature.

<a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> is formally a multiparty constitutional democracy. Each of the elections since independence in September 1966 has been freely and fairly contested and has been held on schedule. The country's small white minority and other minorities participate freely in the political process. There are two main rival parties and a number of smaller parties. General elections are held at least every five years.

The National Assembly has 57 elected and 4 appointed members <a href="http%3A//www.bartleby.com/151/fields/59.html"></a>; it is expanded following each census (every 10 years). After elections, the party that wins the majority elects the State President. The President then appoints the Vice President, but the appointment is subject to endorsement by the National Assembly. 

There are 57 <a href="Parliamentary%20constituencies%20of%20Botswana">parliamentary constituencies</a> in Botswana.

The advisory House of Chiefs represents the eight principal subgroups of the <a href="Batswana">Batswana</a> people, and four other members are elected by the subchiefs of four of the districts. A draft of any National Assembly bill of tribal concern must be referred to the House of Chiefs for advisory opinion. Chiefs and other leaders preside over customary, traditional courts, though all persons have the right to request that their case be considered under the formal British-based legal system.

The President appoints Ministers to head the different government Ministries. The President and Ministers form the Cabinet (Executive). The Cabinet is headed by the President, who is also head of government.

Local government is administered by nine district councils and five town councils. District commissioners have executive authority and are appointed by the central government and assisted by elected and nominated district councilors and district development committees. There has been ongoing debate about the political, social, and economic marginalization of the <a href="San%20people">San</a> (Bushmen).

The highest court of Botswana is the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20%28Botswana%29">Court of Appeal</a>, which is constituted under section 99 of the Constitution and consists of a President and such number of Justices of Appeal as may be prescribed by Parliament. There are currently eight judges of the Court of Appeal, who are all expatriates drawn from different parts of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a>. To date, no Motswana has ever been appointed to the Court of Appeal.

The <a href="High%20Court%20%28Botswana%29">High Court</a> is a superior court of record with unlimited original jurisdiction to hear and determine any criminal and civil cases under any law. The High Court is constituted under section 95 of the Constitution, and consists of a Chief Justice and such number of other judges of the High Court as may be prescribed by Parliament. There are currently sixteen permanent judges of the High Court. Until 1992, the judges of the High Court were expatriate judges who were appointed on short-term contracts of two to three years. In 1992 the first citizen judges were appointed to the bench. There are two High Court divisions in <a href="Lobatse">Lobatse</a> and <a href="Francistown">Francistown</a>.

There are also <a href="Magistrates%27%20Courts">Magistrates' Courts</a> in Botswana. These courts are subordinate to the High Court and hear a range of civil, criminal and family law matters. There are nineteen Magistrates' Courts in the country, with fifty magistrates of whom seventeen are expatriate.

Judges are appointed by the president and may be removed only for cause and after a hearing.

Economy of Botswana

Since independence, <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> has had the highest average economic growth rate in the world, averaging about 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Growth in private sector employment has averaged about 10% per annum over the first 30 years of independence. At the start of the 21st century, however, the economy of Botswana stagnated until the early 2010s, when it registered for the first time since the economic boom, a GDP growth above the 6-7% target. Botswana is also commended for the location of Africa's longest, and among the world's longest economic booms (which almost surpassed that in <a href="Economy%20of%20Asia">Asia</a>'s largest economies). The relatively high quality of the country's statistics means that these figures are likely to be quite accurate. The government has consistently maintained budget surpluses and has extensive <a href="foreign%20exchange%20reserves">foreign exchange reserves</a>.

Botswana's impressive economic record has been built on a foundation of <a href="List%20of%20diamond%20mines%23Botswana">diamond mining</a>, prudent fiscal policies, international financial and technical assistance, and a cautious foreign policy. It is rated the least corrupt country in Africa, according to international corruption watchdog, <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a>. By one estimate, it has the fourth highest <a href="gross%20national%20income">gross national income</a> at <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a> in Africa, giving it a standard of living around that of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>.

Nevertheless, although Botswana is in many ways an exemplar for countries in the region, its dependence on mining and high rate of <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> infection (one in every three adults is seropositive), could threaten its success in the future.

<a href="Trade%20unions%20in%20Botswana">Trade unions</a> represent a minority of workers in the Botswana economy. In general they are loosely organized "in-house" unions, although the <a href="Botswana%20Federation%20of%20Trade%20Unions">Botswana Federation of Trade Unions</a> (BFTU) is consolidating its role as the sole <a href="national%20trade%20union%20centre">national trade union centre</a> in the country.

<a href="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> still provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs and accounts for only 3% of GDP. <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">Subsistence farming</a> and cattle raising predominate. The sector is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. <a href="Tourism">Tourism</a> is also important to the economy. Substantial <a href="mineral">mineral</a> deposits were found in the 1970s and the mining sector grew from 25% of GDP in 1980 to 38% in 1998. Unemployment officially is 21% but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. The Orapa 2000 project doubled the capacity of the country's main <a href="diamond%20mine">diamond mine</a> from early 2000. This will be the main force behind continued economic expansion.

Economic growth slowed in 2005-2008, then turned negative in 2009, contracting by 5.2%. This was due in part to a major recession in the industrial sector, which shrank by 30%, and contrasts with most other African nations who experienced continued growth through this period.

Some of Botswana's budget deficits can be traced to relatively high military expenditures (about 4% of GDP in 2004, according to the "<a href="CIA%20World%20Factbook">CIA World Factbook</a>"). Some critics contend this is unnecessary, given the low likelihood of international conflict, but these troops are also used for multilateral operations and assistance efforts.

One of the biggest problems is the inferior level of economy <a href="diversification%20%28finance%29">diversification</a> they have. In 2008, they depended largely on services (45.2%), industry (52.9%) and agriculture (1.9%) strictly linked to the trade with <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.

Botswana is part of the Southern African Customs Union (<a href="SACU">SACU</a>) with South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Namibia. The <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> reports that in 2001 (the most recent year for which World Bank data are available), the SACU had a weighted average <a href="common%20external%20tariff">common external tariff</a> rate of 3.6 percent. According to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce">U.S. Department of Commerce</a>, "There are very few tariff or non-tariff barriers to trade with Botswana, apart from restrictions on licensing for some business operations, which are reserved for [Botswana] companies." Based on the revised trade factor methodology, Botswana's trade policy score is unchanged.
The main export of Botswana is diamonds. <a href="Jwaneng">Jwaneng</a>, in Botswana, is the world's largest and richest diamond mine thus the demand of diamonds from Botswana is fairly high. The mine was discovered when termites looking for water brought grains of diamond to the surface. If the great demand of diamonds were to go into rapid decline, then the economy of Botswana would suffer greatly as they are highly dependent on this export. The diamond mine in Jwaneng provides many jobs for the unemployed in Botswana as people are needed to physically extract the diamonds, and to build the roads needed for their transport, for example. A source of foreign exchange is also introduced to the economy and it offers a potential basis for industrial development, and thus stimulates improvements within Botswana's infrastructure.

Two large mining companies, <a href="Debswana">Debswana</a> (formed by the government and South Africa's <a href="De%20Beers">De Beers</a> in equal partnership) and Bamangwato Concessions, Ltd. (BCL, also with substantial government equity participation) operate in the country. BCL was placed in provisional liquidation in late 2016, following years of loss-making operations, and was placed into final liquidation by the High Court in June 2017.

Since the early 1980s, the country has been the world's largest producer of gem diamonds. Four large diamond mines have opened since independence. De Beers prospectors discovered diamonds in northern Botswana in the early 1970s. The first mine began production at <a href="Orapa%20diamond%20mine">Orapa</a> in 1972, followed by a smaller mine at <a href="Letlhakane%20diamond%20mine">Letlhakane</a>. What has become the single richest diamond mine in the world opened in <a href="Jwaneng%20diamond%20mine">Jwaneng</a> in 1982. In 2002, a fourth diamond mine, <a href="Damtshaa%20diamond%20mine">Damtshaa</a>, began operation. Botswana produced a total over 30 million carats (6,000 kg) of diamonds (about 25% of worldwide production) from the three Debswana mines in 1999, and is the highest producer of diamonds by value in the world. The Orapa 2000 Expansion of the existing Orapa mine was opened in 2000. A fifth diamond mine, the first not operated by Debswanais scheduled to have begun operations in 2008 in <a href="Lerala">Lerala</a>.

Most (70%) of Botswana's electricity is imported from South Africa's <a href="Eskom">Eskom</a>. 80% of domestic production is concentrated in one plant, <a href="Morupule%20Power%20Station">Morupule Power Station</a> near <a href="Palapye">Palapye</a>, operated by the <a href="Botswana%20Power%20Corporation">Botswana Power Corporation</a>. Debswana operates the nearby <a href="Morupule%20Colliery">Morupule Colliery</a> to supply coal to it. In early 2008, the entire southern African region was hit hard by massive shortages in power, since the region works to share its power resources through the <a href="Southern%20African%20Power%20Pool">Southern African Power Pool</a>, with most of the capacity coming from South Africa. Botswana has in turn put in place plans to become a net exporter of power to the regional pool, through governmental expansion of the Morupule power station, as well as encouraging private investment in the form of a 4 gigawatt power station by the Canadian Greenfield company CIC Energy.

The soda ash operation at Sua Pan, opened in 1991 and supported by substantial government investment, has begun making a profit following significant restructuring.

In the last years they discovered the presence of <a href="methane">methane</a> in the surroundings of the carbon mine of Morupule, near <a href="Francistown">Francistown</a>. The commercial quantity available is believed to be around 340 <a href="Cubic%20metre">km</a>, and the extraction officially began in 2004.. However there has been no significant exploration of extraction activities.

<a href="Tourism">Tourism</a> is an increasingly important industry in Botswana, accounting for almost 12% of GDP. One of the world's unique ecosystems, the <a href="Okavango%20Delta">Okavango Delta</a>, is located in Botswana. The country offers excellent game viewing and birding both in the Delta and in the <a href="Chobe%20Game%20Reserve">Chobe Game Reserve</a> — home to one of the largest herds of free-ranging elephants in the world. Botswana's <a href="Central%20Kalahari%20Game%20Reserve">Central Kalahari Game Reserve</a> also offers good game viewing and some of the most remote and unspoiled wilderness in southern Africa.

A number of national parks and game reserves, with their abundant wildlife and wetlands, are major tourist attractions. The wildlife, including lions, <a href="brown%20hyena">brown hyena</a>s, cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs and antelope, was described in great detail in the best-selling book "Cry of the Kalahari" by Mark and Delia Owens.

The main <a href="safari">safari</a> destinations for tourism are <a href="Moremi%20Game%20Reserve">Moremi Game Reserve</a> in the Okavango Delta, and <a href="Chobe%20National%20Park">Chobe National Park</a>. Botswana is also participating in community based natural resource management projects by trying to involve villagers in tourism. One example is the village of <a href="Khwai">Khwai</a> and its Khwai Development Trust.

Botswana was the setting for the 1980 movie "<a href="The%20Gods%20Must%20Be%20Crazy">The Gods Must Be Crazy</a>", although the movie was mostly filmed in South Africa.
The seventh season of the "<a href="Amazing%20Race">Amazing Race</a>" visited Botswana. Tourism has been stimulated by the <a href="The%20No.%201%20Ladies%27%20Detective%20Agency">series of detective novels</a> by <a href="Alexander%20McCall%20Smith">Alexander McCall Smith</a> and the American dramatisation that followed them.

More than half of Batswana (preferred address of the people of Botswana) live in rural areas and are dependent on subsistence crop and livestock farming, together with money sent home by relatives in urban areas. Agriculture meets only a small portion of food needs and contributes just 2.8% to GDP—primarily through beef exports—but it remains a social and cultural touchstone. Cattle raising dominated Botswana's social and economic life before independence. The <a href="Botswana%20Meat%20Commission">Botswana Meat Commission</a> (BMC) has a monopoly on beef production. The national herd was about 2.5 million in the mid-1990s, though the government-ordered slaughter of the entire herd in Botswana's north-west <a href="Ngamiland">Ngamiland</a> District in 1995 has reduced the number by at least 200,000. The slaughter was ordered to prevent the spread of "cattle lung disease" to other parts of the country.

Only about 0.7% of total land area is <a href="Arable%20land">arable</a>. Crop production is hampered by traditional farming methods, recurrent drought, erosion, and disease. Most of the land under cultivation is in the eastern region. The principal crops for domestic use are <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="Maize">corn</a>, and <a href="millet">millet</a>. Sorghum and corn production in 2004 were 32,000 tons and 10,000 tons, respectively. The sorghum and corn harvests comprise less than 10% of the annual requirement of 250,000 tons. In 2004, Botswana’s agricultural imports (primarily cereals) exceeded agricultural exports by $102.5 million. Grain
is often imported from South Africa. Smaller quantities of <a href="cowpea">cowpea</a>s, <a href="beans">beans</a>, and other pulses are also grown. The 2004 output of all these crops was about 20,000 tons; in addition, 16,000 tons of vegetables and 10,000 tons of fruit were grown.

Agricultural research has been devoted to soil conservation, grazing experiments, and developing and distributing improved strains of grain. The construction of dams and the drilling of boreholes to tap underground water are continuing government programs. In early 1990, the government changed its official agricultural policy to emphasize the production only of those foodstuffs that can be raised economically. The Arable Lands Development
Program and the Tribal Grazing Land Policy are government programs designed to help farmers in communal areas.

Botswana seeks to diversify its economy away from <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s, the earnings from which have levelled off. In 1998-99, non-mineral sectors of the economy grew at 8.9%, partially offsetting a slight 4.4% decline in the minerals sector. <a href="Foreign%20direct%20investment">Foreign investment</a> and management have been welcomed in Botswana.

External investment in Botswana has grown fitfully. In the early 1990s, two American companies, Owens Corning and H.J. <a href="H.%20J.%20Heinz%20Company">Heinz</a>, made major investments in production facilities in Botswana. In 1997, the St. Paul Group purchased Botswana Insurance, one of the country's leading short-term insurance providers. An American Business Council (ABC), with over 30 member companies, was inaugurated in 1995.

<a href="Hyundai">Hyundai</a> operated a car assembly plant in Botswana from 1994 to 2000.
Botswana seeks to further diversify its economy away from minerals, which account for a quarter of GDP, down from nearly half of GDP in the early 1990s. Foreign investment and management are welcomed in Botswana and, as a result, financial and services sectors have increased at an exponential rate in the 2000s to replace mining as the leading industry. Botswana abolished <a href="foreign%20exchange%20controls">foreign exchange controls</a> in 1999, has a low corporate tax rate (15%), no prohibitions on foreign ownership of companies, and a moderate inflation rate (7.6% November 2004).

The government considers private-sector participation as being critical to the success of the country's "Tenth National Development Plan" (2009–2016) and enhancing the <a href="Science%20and%20technology%20in%20Botswana">role of research and development</a> as being the most effective way to nurture entrepreneurship and private-sector growth. The government is considering additional policies to enhance competitiveness, including a new Foreign Direct Investment Strategy, Competition Policy, Privatisation Master Plan and National Export Development Strategy.

Botswana is known to have vast coal deposits making it possibly one of the most coal-rich countries in the world. Large coal mines, massive coal-fired power plants, as well as a coals to liquid plant (through the <a href="Fischer-Tropsch%20process">Fischer-Tropsch process</a>) to produce synthetic automotive fuel have been planned.

With its proven record of good economic governance, Botswana was ranked as Africa's least corrupt country by <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a> in 2004, ahead of many European and Asian countries. The World Economic Forum rates Botswana as one of the two most economically competitive nations in Africa. In 2004 Botswana was once again assigned "A" grade credit ratings by <a href="Moody%27s">Moody's</a> and <a href="Standard%20%26amp%3B%20Poor%27s">Standard & Poor's</a>. This ranks Botswana as by far the best credit risk in Africa and puts it on par with or above many countries in central Europe, East Asia, and Latin America.

U.S. investment in Botswana remains at relatively low levels, but continues to grow. Major U.S. corporations, such as <a href="H.J.%20Heinz">H.J. Heinz</a> and <a href="AON%20Corporation">AON Corporation</a>, are present through direct investments, while others, such as <a href="Kentucky%20Fried%20Chicken">Kentucky Fried Chicken</a> and <a href="Remax">Remax</a>, are present via franchise. The sovereign credit ratings by Moody's and Standard & Poor's clearly indicate that, despite continued challenges such as small market size, landlocked location, and cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Botswana remains one of the best investment opportunities in the developing world. Botswana has a 90-member American Business Council that accepts membership from American-affiliated companies.

Due to its history and geography, Botswana has long had deep ties to the economy of South Africa. The <a href="Southern%20Africa%20Customs%20Union">Southern Africa Customs Union</a> (SACU), comprising Botswana, <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>, Swaziland, and South Africa, dates from 1910, and is the world’s oldest customs union. Namibia joined in 1990. Under this arrangement, South Africa has collected <a href="Tax">levies</a> from customs, sales, and excise duties for all five members, sharing out proceeds based on each countries portion of imports. The exact formula for sharing revenues and the decision-making authority over duties—held exclusively by the Government of South Africa—became increasingly controversial, and the members renegotiated the arrangement in 2001. The new structure has now been formally ratified and a SACU Secretariat has been established in <a href="Windhoek">Windhoek</a>, Namibia. Following South Africa's accession to the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO), Botswana also joined; many of the SACU duties are thus declining, making products from outside the area more competitive in Botswana. Currently the SACU countries and the U.S. are negotiating a free trade agreement. Botswana is currently also negotiating a free trade agreement with <a href="Mercosur">Mercosur</a> and an Economic Partnership Agreement with the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> as part of SADC.
Gaborone is host to the headquarters of the fourteen-nation <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">Southern African Development Community</a> (SADC), a successor to the <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Coordination%20Conference">Southern African Development Coordination Conference</a> (SADCC, established in 1980), which focused its efforts on freeing regional economic development from dependence on apartheid South Africa. SADC embraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in 1994 and has a broad mandate to encourage growth, development, and economic integration in Southern Africa. SADC's Trade Protocol, which was launched on 1 September 2000, calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by 2008 among the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it will give Botswana companies free access to the far larger regional market. SADC's failure to distance itself from the <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Mugabe</a> government in Zimbabwe has diminished the number of opportunities for cooperation between the U.S. and SADC.

Botswana has successfully carried an Action Programme on the Elimination of <a href="Child%20labour%20in%20Botswana">Child Labour</a>, which was adopted in the period 2006-2007. <a href="Free%20the%20Children">Free the Children</a> delisted Botswana as a nation harbouring child-labour facilities in 2008.

Botswana has a growing financial sector, and the country's national stock market, the <a href="Botswana%20Stock%20Exchange">Botswana Stock Exchange</a> (BSE), based in Gaborone, is given the responsibility to operate and regulate the equities and fixed interest securities market. Formally established in 1989, the BSE continues to be pivotal to Botswana’s financial system, and in particular the capital market, as an avenue on which government, quasi-government and the private sector can raise debt and equity capital. Although the BSE has just under 40 companies listed, it plays host to the most pre-eminent companies doing business in Botswana. These companies represent a spectrum of industries and commerce, from Banking and financial services to Wholesaling and Retailing, Tourism and Information Technology.

To date, the BSE is one of Africa’s best performing stock exchanges, averaging 24% aggregate return in the past decade. This has allowed the BSE to be the third largest stock exchange, in terms of market capitalization, in Southern Africa.

Given Botswana's lack of exchange controls, stable currency and exceptionally performing stock market, the financial sector has attracted a host of global investors seeking better returns.

Botswana's currency, the <a href="Botswana%20pula">pula</a>, is fully convertible and is valued against a basket of currencies heavily weighted toward the South African <a href="Rand%20%28currency%29">Rand</a>. Profits and direct investment can be repatriated without restriction from Botswana. The Botswana Government eliminated all exchange controls in 1999. The Central Bank devalued the Pula by 7.5% in February 2004 in a bid to maintain export competitiveness against the real appreciation of the Pula. There was a further 12% devaluation in May 2005 and the policy of a "<a href="Crawling%20peg">Crawling peg</a>" was adopted.

The recently established Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) is responsible for the oversight of all non-banking financial services entities in the country. As of 2005, about 54 percent of Botswana’s population had access to formal or informal financial services, and 43 percent is banked (with access to at least one formal banking product). The overall access ratio is still low, especially in rural areas, where there are 3.8 branches and 73 ATMs per 100,000 people. Mobile banking services have just started to be offered. In recent years the government and Central Bank have undertaken serious steps to modernize the country’s payment system infrastructure. These efforts included the establishment of a code-line clearing system for the exchange of cheques and electronic funds as well as a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, including SWIFT connection. The stock exchange implemented a Central Securities Depository in 2007. Remittance Flows for Botswana amounted to USD 117 million in 2007, a figure that is higher than the total net value of official development assistance.

<a href="Gaborone">Gaborone</a> is host to the headquarters of the 14-nation <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">Southern African Development Community</a> (SADC). A successor to the <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Coordination%20Conference">Southern African Development Coordination Conference</a> (SADCC), which focused its efforts on freeing regional economic development from dependence on apartheid in South Africa, SADC embraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in 1994 and has a broad mandate to encourage growth, development, and economic integration in Southern Africa. SADC's Trade Protocol, which was launched on 1 September 2000, calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by 2012 among the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it will give Botswana companies free access to the far larger regional market. The Regional Center for Southern Africa (RCSA), which implements the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) Initiative for Southern Africa (ISA), is headquartered in <a href="Gaborone">Gaborone</a> as well.

Transport in Botswana

A sparsely populated, arid country, <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> has nonetheless managed to incorporate much of its interior into the national economy. An "inner circle" <a href="highway">highway</a> connecting all major towns and district capitals is completely paved, and the all-weather <a href="Trans-Kalahari">Trans-Kalahari</a> Highway connects the country (and, through it, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>'s commercially dominant <a href="Gauteng%20Province">Gauteng Province</a>) to <a href="Walvis%20Bay">Walvis Bay</a> in <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>.

Botswana possesses 888 km of gauge railway, by 2019 figures, serving a number of towns and connecting the country to its neighbours.

All passenger services were discontinued in 2009, with the only remaining service being an international link to Zimbabwe from Francistown. Freight trains still operate. Passenger service was expected to resume in late 2015. Passenger services were later re-introduced in March 2016. Botswana Railways run 2 nightly passenger trains, one from <a href="Lobatse">Lobatse</a> to <a href="Francistown">Francistown</a>, and the other from Francistown to Lobatse, with stops in <a href="Gaborone">Gaborone</a>, <a href="Mahalapye">Mahalapye</a>, <a href="Palapye">Palapye</a>, and <a href="Serule">Serule</a>.

Botswana possesses 10,217 km of <a href="highway">highway</a>, of which 5,620 km are paved. Since 1996 estimates, there has been a significant reduction in the total length of unpaved highway in Botswana - between 1996 and 1999 total length of unpaved highway fell from 14,139 km to 4,597 km.

Traditionally, <a href="road%20signs%20in%20Botswana">road signs in Botswana</a> used blue backgrounds rather than the yellow, white, or orange which the rest of the world uses on traffic <a href="warning%20sign">warning sign</a>s.

Geography of Brazil

The country of Brazil occupies roughly half of <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, bordering the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. Brazil covers a total area of which includes of land and of water. The highest point in Brazil is <a href="Pico%20da%20Neblina">Pico da Neblina</a> at . Brazil is bordered by the countries of <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, and <a href="France">France</a> (overseas department of France, <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a>).

Much of the climate is tropical, with the south being relatively temperate. The largest river in Brazil, the second longest in the world, is the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon</a>. The <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> that covers the <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon Basin</a> constitutes almost half of the rainforests on Earth.

With its expansive territory, Brazil occupies most of the eastern part of the <a href="South%20America">South American continent</a> and its geographic heartland (48% of South America), as well as various islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The only countries in the world that are larger are Russia, Canada, China, and the United States. The national territory extends from north to south (5°16'20" N to 33°44'32" S latitude), making Brazil the longest country in the world and from east to west (34°47'30" W to 73°59'32" W longitude). It spans three <a href="time%20zone">time zone</a>s, the westernmost of which is one hour ahead of <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Eastern Standard Time</a> in the United States. The <a href="Time%20in%20Brazil">time zone of the capital (Brasília)</a> and of the most populated part of Brazil along the east coast (<a href="UTC-3">UTC-3</a>) is two hours ahead of <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Eastern Standard Time</a>, except when it is on its own <a href="daylight%20saving%20time">daylight saving time</a>, from October to February. The Atlantic islands are in the easternmost time zone.

Brazil possesses the archipelago of <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a>, located northeast of its "horn", and several small islands and atolls in the Atlantic - <a href="Abrolhos%20Marine%20National%20Park">Abrolhos</a>, <a href="Atol%20das%20Rocas">Atol das Rocas</a>, <a href="Saint%20Peter%20and%20Paul%20Rocks">Penedos de São Pedro e São Paulo</a>, <a href="Trindade%20and%20Martim%20Vaz">Trindade</a>, and <a href="Trindade%20and%20Martim%20Vaz">Martim Vaz</a>. In the early 1970s, Brazil claimed a territorial sea extending from the country's shores, including those of the islands.

On Brazil's east coast, the Atlantic coastline extends . In the west, in clockwise order from the south, Brazil has of borders with Uruguay, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>, and <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a> (overseas department of <a href="France">France</a>). The only South American countries with which Brazil does not share borders are <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>. A few short sections are in question, but there are no true major boundary controversies with any of the neighboring countries.

Brazil has six major <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s: the <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon Basin</a>, a tropical rainforest system; the <a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a> bordering Paraguay and Bolivia, a tropical wetland system; the <a href="Cerrado">Cerrado</a>, a <a href="savanna">savanna</a> system that covers much of the center of the country; the <a href="Caatinga">Caatinga</a> or thorny scrubland habitat of the Northeast; the <a href="Atlantic%20Forest">Atlantic Forest</a> (Mata Atlântica) that extends along the entire coast from the Northeast to the South; and the <a href="Pampas">Pampas</a> or fertile lowland plains of the far South.

In contrast to the <a href="Andes">Andes</a>, which rose to elevations of nearly in a relatively recent epoch and inverted the Amazon's direction of flow from westward to eastward, Brazil's geological formation is very old. <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> crystalline shields cover 36% of the territory, especially its central area. The dramatic granite <a href="bornhardt">sugarloaf mountains</a> in the city of Rio de Janeiro are an example of the terrain of the Brazilian shield regions, where continental basement rock has been sculpted into towering domes and columns by tens of millions of years of <a href="erosion">erosion</a>, untouched by mountain-building events.

The principal mountain ranges average elevations just under . The <a href="Serra%20do%20Mar">Serra do Mar</a> Range hugs the Atlantic coast, and the <a href="Serra%20do%20Espinha%C3%A7o">Serra do Espinhaço</a> Range, the largest in area, extends through the south-central part of the country. The highest mountains are in the Tumucumaque, <a href="Pacaraima">Pacaraima</a>, and Imeri ranges, among others, which traverse the northern border with the Guianas and Venezuela.

In addition to mountain ranges (about 0.5% of the country is above ), Brazil's Central Highlands include a vast central plateau (<a href="Planalto%20Central">Planalto Central</a>). The plateau's uneven terrain has an average elevation of . The rest of the territory is made up primarily of sedimentary basins, the largest of which is drained by the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon</a> and its tributaries. Of the total territory, 41% averages less than in elevation. The coastal zone is noted for thousands of kilometers of tropical beaches interspersed with <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s, <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s, and <a href="dune">dune</a>s, as well as numerous <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s.
The <a href="Parcel%20de%20Manuel%20Lu%C3%ADs%20Marine%20State%20Park">Parcel de Manuel Luís Marine State Park</a> off the coast of <a href="Maranh%C3%A3o">Maranhão</a> protects the largest coral reef in South America.

Brazil has one of the world's most extensive <a href="river%20system">river system</a>s, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic Ocean. Two of these basins — the <a href="Amazon%20basin">Amazon</a> and Tocantins-Araguaia account for more than half the total drainage area. The largest river system in Brazil is the Amazon, which originates in the Andes and receives tributaries from a basin that covers 45.7% of the country, principally the north and west. The main Amazon river system is the Amazonas-Solimões-Ucayali axis (the -long Ucayali is a Peruvian tributary), flowing from west to east. Through the Amazon Basin flows one-fifth of the world's fresh water. A total of of the Amazon are in Brazilian territory. Over this distance, the waters decline only about . The major tributaries on the southern side are, from west to east, the Javari, Juruá, Purus (all three of which flow into the western section of the Amazon called the <a href="Solim%C3%B5es">Solimões</a>), <a href="Madeira%20River">Madeira</a>, <a href="Tapaj%C3%B3s">Tapajós</a>, <a href="Xingu%20River">Xingu</a>, and <a href="Tocantins%20River">Tocantins</a>. On the northern side, the largest tributaries are the <a href="Branco%20River">Branco</a>, <a href="Japur%C3%A1%20River">Japurá</a>, <a href="Jari%20River">Jari</a>, and <a href="Rio%20Negro%20%28Amazon%29">Rio Negro</a>. The above-mentioned tributaries carry more water than the Mississippi (its discharge is less than one-tenth that of the Amazon). The Amazon and some of its tributaries, called "white" rivers, bear rich sediments and hydrobiological elements. The black-white and clear rivers—such as the Negro, Tapajós, and Xingu—have clear (greenish) or dark water with few nutrients and little sediment.

The major river system in the Northeast is the <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Francisco%20River">Rio São Francisco</a>, which flows northeast from the south-central region. Its basin covers 7.6% of the national territory. Only of the lower river are navigable for oceangoing ships. The <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20River">Paraná</a> system covers 14.5% of the country. The Paraná flows south among the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata%20Basin">Río de la Plata Basin</a>, reaching the Atlantic between Argentina and Uruguay. The headwaters of the Paraguai, the Paraná's major eastern tributary, constitute the <a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a>, the largest contiguous wetlands in the world, covering as much as .

Below their descent from the highlands, many of the tributaries of the Amazon are navigable. Upstream, they generally have <a href="rapid">rapid</a>s or <a href="waterfall">waterfall</a>s, and boats and barges also must face sandbars, trees, and other obstacles. Nevertheless, the Amazon is navigable by oceangoing vessels as far as upstream, reaching <a href="Iquitos">Iquitos</a> in <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. The Amazon river system was the principal means of access until new roads became more important. Hydroelectric projects are <a href="Itaipu%20Dam">Itaipu</a>, in Paraná, with 12,600 MW; Tucuruí, in <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a>, with 7,746 MW; and <a href="Paulo%20Afonso">Paulo Afonso</a>, in <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, with 3,986 MW.

<a href="Natural%20resources">Natural resources</a> include: <a href="bauxite">bauxite</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="phosphates">phosphates</a>, <a href="platinum">platinum</a>, <a href="tin">tin</a>, <a href="clay">clay</a>, rare earth elements, <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a>, <a href="hydropower">hydropower</a> and <a href="timber">timber</a>.

<a href="List%20of%20rivers%20of%20Brazil">List of rivers of Brazil</a>

According to organs of the Brazilian government there are 12 major hydrographic regions in Brazil. Seven of these are river basins named after their main rivers; the other five are groupings of various river basins in areas which have no dominant river.


The <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a> is the widest and second longest river (behind the Nile) in the world. This huge river drains the greater part of the world's rainforests. Another major river, the Paraná, has its source in Brazil. It forms the border of Paraguay and Argentina, then winds its way through Argentina and into the Atlantic Ocean, along the southern coast of Uruguay.

Brazil's tropical soils produce almost 210 million tons of grain crops per year, from about 70 millions hectares of crops. The country also has the largest arable land in the world. Burning also is used traditionally to remove tall, dry, and nutrient-poor grass from pasture at the end of the dry season. Until mechanization and the use of chemical and genetic inputs increased during the agricultural intensification period of the 1970s and 1980s, <a href="coffee">coffee</a> planting and farming in general moved constantly onward to new lands in the west and north. This pattern of horizontal or extensive expansion maintained low levels of technology and productivity and placed emphasis on quantity rather than quality of agricultural production.

The largest areas of fertile soils, called terra roxa (red earth), are found in the states of <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29">Paraná</a> and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>. The least fertile areas are in the Amazon, where the dense <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> is. Soils in the <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Northeast</a> are often fertile, but they lack water, unless they are <a href="irrigation">irrigated</a> artificially.

In the 1980s, investments made possible the use of irrigation, especially in the Northeast Region and in <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a> State, which had shifted from grazing to <a href="soy">soy</a> and <a href="rice">rice</a> production in the 1970s. <a href="Savanna">Savanna</a> soils also were made usable for soybean farming through acidity correction, <a href="fertilization">fertilization</a>, <a href="plant%20breeding">plant breeding</a>, and in some cases spray irrigation. As agriculture underwent modernization in the 1970s and 1980s, soil fertility became less important for agricultural production than factors related to capital investment, such as infrastructure, mechanization, use of chemical inputs, breeding, and proximity to markets. Consequently, the vigor of frontier expansion weakened.

The variety of climates, soils, and drainage conditions in Brazil is reflected in the range of its vegetation types. The Amazon Basin and the areas of heavy rainfall along the Atlantic coast have tropical rain forest composed of <a href="broadleaf">broadleaf</a> evergreen trees. The rain forest may contain as many as 3,000 <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="flora">flora</a> and <a href="fauna">fauna</a> within a area. The Atlantic Forest is reputed to have even greater biological diversity than the Amazon rain forest, which, despite apparent homogeneity, contains many types of vegetation, from high canopy forest to bamboo groves.

In the semiarid Northeast, <a href="caatinga">caatinga</a>, a dry, thick, thorny vegetation, predominates. Most of central Brazil is covered with a woodland savanna, known as the <a href="cerrado">cerrado</a> (sparse scrub trees and drought-resistant grasses), which became an area of agricultural development after the mid-1970s. In the <a href="Southern%20Region%2C%20Brazil">South</a> (Sul), needle-leaved <a href="pine">pine</a>woods (Paraná pine or <a href="araucaria">araucaria</a>) cover the highlands; grassland similar to the Argentine <a href="pampa">pampa</a> covers the sea-level plains. The Mato Grosso <a href="swampland">swampland</a>s (<a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a> Mato-grossense) is a <a href="Florida">Florida</a>-sized plain in the western portion of the Center-West (Centro-Oeste). It is covered with tall <a href="grass">grass</a>es, <a href="Woody%20plant">bush</a>es, and widely dispersed trees similar to those of the cerrado and is partly submerged during the rainy season.
Brazil, which is named after reddish dyewood (<a href="pau%20brasil">pau brasil</a>), has long been famous for the wealth of its tropical forests. These are not, however, as important to world markets as those of Asia and Africa, which started to reach depletion only in the 1980s. By 1996 more than 90% of the original Atlantic forest had been cleared, primarily for agriculture, with little use made of the wood, except for araucaria pine in Paraná.

The inverse situation existed with regard to clearing for wood in the Amazon rain forest, of which about 15% had been cleared by 1994, and part of the remainder had been disturbed by selective logging. Because the Amazon forest is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of woody species per <a href="hectare">hectare</a>, there is considerable distance between individual trees of economic value, such as <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> and cerejeira. Therefore, this type of forest is not normally cleared for timber extraction but logged through high-grading, or selection of the most valuable trees. Because of vines, felling, and transportation, their removal causes destruction of many other trees, and the litter and new growth create a risk of <a href="forest%20fire">forest fire</a>s, which are otherwise rare in <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s. In favorable locations, such as Paragominas, in the northeastern part of <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a> State, a new pattern of timber extraction has emerged: diversification and the production of <a href="plywood">plywood</a> have led to the economic use of more than 100 tree species.

Starting in the late 1980s, rapid deforestation and extensive burning in Brazil received considerable international and national attention. <a href="Satellite%20image">Satellite image</a>s have helped document and quantify deforestation as well as fires, but their use also has generated considerable controversy because of problems of defining original vegetation, cloud cover, and dealing with secondary growth and because fires, as mentioned above, may occur in old pasture rather than signifying new clearing. Public policies intended to promote sustainable management of timber extraction, as well as sustainable use of nontimber forest products (such as rubber, <a href="Brazil%20nut">Brazil nut</a>s, <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s, <a href="seed">seed</a>s, <a href="vegetable%20oil">oils</a>, and <a href="vine">vine</a>s), were being discussed intensely in the mid-1990s. However, implementing the principles of sustainable development, without irreversible damage to the environment, proved to be more challenging than establishing international agreements about them.

Although 90% of the country is within the <a href="tropical%20zone">tropical zone</a>, the climate of Brazil varies considerably from the mostly tropical North (the <a href="equator">equator</a> traverses the mouth of the Amazon) to <a href="temperate%20zone">temperate zone</a>s below the <a href="Tropic%20of%20Capricorn">Tropic of Capricorn</a> (23°27' S latitude), which crosses the country at the latitude of the city of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28city%29">São Paulo</a>. Brazil has five climatic regions: <a href="Equatorial%20climate">equatorial</a>, tropical, <a href="semiarid">semiarid</a>, <a href="tropical">highland tropical</a>, and <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a>.

Temperatures along the <a href="equator">equator</a> are high, averaging above , but not reaching the summer extremes of up to in the temperate zones. There is little seasonal variation near the equator, although at times it can get cool enough for wearing a jacket, especially in the rain. At the country's other extreme, there are frosts south of the Tropic of Capricorn during the winter (June–August), and there is snow in the mountainous areas, such as <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29">Paraná</a>, <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a> and <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>. Temperatures in the cities of São Paulo, <a href="Belo%20Horizonte">Belo Horizonte</a>, and <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a> are moderate (usually between ), despite their relatively low latitude, because of their elevation of approximately . <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28city%29">Rio de Janeiro</a>, Recife, and Salvador on the coast have warm climates, with average temperatures ranging from , but enjoy constant trade winds. The southern cities of <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a> and <a href="Curitiba">Curitiba</a> have a subtropical climate similar to that in parts of the United States and Europe, and temperatures can fall below freezing in winter.

Precipitation levels vary widely. Most of Brazil has moderate <a href="rainfall">rainfall</a> of between a year, with most of the rain falling in the winter (between December and April) south of the Equator. The <a href="Amazon%20region">Amazon region</a> is notoriously humid, with rainfall generally more than per year and reaching as high as in parts of the western Amazon and near Belém. It is less widely known that, despite high annual precipitation, the Amazon rain forest has a three- to five-month dry season, the timing of which varies according to location north or south of the equator.

High and relatively regular levels of precipitation in the Amazon contrast sharply with the dryness of the semiarid Northeast, where rainfall is scarce and there are severe droughts in cycles averaging seven years. The <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Northeast</a> is the driest part of the country. The region also constitutes the hottest part of Brazil, where during the dry season between May and November, temperatures of more than have been recorded. However, the <a href="sert%C3%A3o">sertão</a>, a region of <a href="desert">semidesert vegetation</a> used primarily for low-density ranching, turns green when there is rain. Most of the Center-West has of rain per year, with a pronounced dry season in the middle of the year, while the South and most of the year without a distinct dry season.

Brazil's 26 <a href="States%20of%20Brazil">states</a> and the <a href="Federal%20District%20%28Brazil%29">Federal District</a> (Distrito Federal) are divided conventionally into five regions: <a href="North%20Region%2C%20Brazil">North</a> (Norte), Northeast (Nordeste), <a href="Southeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Southeast</a> (Sudeste), <a href="Southern%20Region%2C%20Brazil">South</a> (Sul), and <a href="Center-West%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Center-West</a> (Centro-Oeste) - see fig. 4. In 2015 there were 5,570 <a href="municipal">municipal</a>ities (municípios), which have municipal governments. Many municipalities, which are comparable to United States counties, are in turn divided into <a href="district">district</a>s (distritos), which do not have <a href="Politics">political</a> or <a href="Administrative%20division">administrative</a> <a href="autonomy">autonomy</a>. In 2015 there were 10,424 districts. All municipal and district seats, regardless of size, are considered officially to be urban. For purely statistical purposes, the municipalities were grouped in 1990 into 558 micro-regions, which in turn constituted 137 meso-regions. This grouping modified the previous micro-regional division established in 1968, a division that was used to present census data for 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.

Each of the five major regions has a distinct <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. Administrative boundaries do not necessarily coincide with ecological boundaries, however. In addition to differences in <a href="physical%20environment">physical environment</a>, patterns of <a href="economic%20activity">economic activity</a> and population settlement vary widely among the regions. The principal ecological characteristics of each of the five major regions, as well as their principal socioeconomic and demographic features, are summarized below.

The Center-West consists of the states of <a href="Goi%C3%A1s">Goiás</a>, <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a>, <a href="Mato%20Grosso%20do%20Sul">Mato Grosso do Sul</a> (separated from Mato Grosso in 1979) and the <a href="Federal%20District%20%28Brazil%29">Federal District</a>, where <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a> is located, the national capital. Until 1988 Goiás State included the area that then became the state of Tocantins in the North.

The Center-West has and covers 18.9% of the national territory. Its main biome is the <a href="cerrado">cerrado</a>, the tropical savanna in which natural grassland is partly covered with twisted shrubs and small trees. The cerrado was used for low-density cattle-raising in the past but is now also used for soybean production. There are <a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>s along the rivers and streams and some larger areas of forest, most of which have been cleared for <a href="farming">farming</a> and <a href="livestock">livestock</a>. In the north, the cerrado blends into tropical forest. It also includes the <a href="Pantanal">Pantanal</a> <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s in the west, known for their wildlife, especially aquatic birds and <a href="caiman">caiman</a>s. In the early 1980s, 33.6% of the region had been altered by anthropic activities, with a low of 9.3% in Mato Grosso and a high of 72.9% in Goiás (not including Tocantins). In 1996 the Center-West region had 10.2 million inhabitants, or 6% of Brazil's total population. The average density is low, with concentrations in and around the cities of <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a>, <a href="Goi%C3%A2nia">Goiânia</a>, <a href="Campo%20Grande">Campo Grande</a>, and <a href="Cuiab%C3%A1">Cuiabá</a>. Living standards are below the national average. In 1994 they were highest in the Federal District, with per capita income of US$7,089 (the highest in the nation), and lowest in Mato Grosso, with US$2,268.

The nine states that make up the Northeast are <a href="Alagoas">Alagoas</a>, <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, <a href="Cear%C3%A1">Ceará</a>, <a href="Maranh%C3%A3o">Maranhão</a>, <a href="Para%C3%ADba">Paraíba</a>, <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a>, <a href="Piau%C3%AD">Piauí</a>, Rio Grande do Norte, and <a href="Sergipe">Sergipe</a>. The <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a> archipelago (formerly the federal territory of <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a>, now part of <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> state) is also included in the Northeast.

The Northeast, with , covers 18.3% of the national terrest concentration of rural population, and its living standards are the lowest in Brazil. In 1994 Piauí had the lowest per capita income in the region and the country, only US$835, while Sergipe had the highest average income in the region, with US$1,958.

The equatorial North, also known as the Amazon or <a href="Amaz%C3%B4nia">Amazônia</a>, includes, from west to east, the states of <a href="Rond%C3%B4nia">Rondônia</a>, Acre, <a href="Amazonas%20State%2C%20Brazil">Amazonas</a>, <a href="Roraima">Roraima</a>, <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a>, <a href="Amap%C3%A1">Amapá</a>, and, as of 1988, <a href="Tocantins%20%28state%29">Tocantins</a> (created from the northern part of Goiás State, which is situated in the Center-West). Rondônia, previously a federal territory, became a state in 1986. The former federal territories of Roraima and Amapá were raised to statehood in 1988.

With , the North is the country's largest region, covering 45.3% of the national territory. The region's principal <a href="biome">biome</a> is the humid <a href="tropical%20forest">tropical forest</a>, also known as the rain forest, home to some of the planet's richest <a href="biological%20diversity">biological diversity</a>. The North has served as a source of forest products ranging from "backlands drugs" (such as <a href="Smilax%20regelii">sarsaparilla</a>, <a href="cocoa%20bean">cocoa</a>, <a href="cinnamon">cinnamon</a>, and <a href="turtle">turtle butter</a>) in the colonial period to rubber and <a href="Brazil%20nut">Brazil nut</a>s in more recent times. In the mid-twentieth century, nonforest products from <a href="mining">mining</a>, <a href="farming">farming</a>, and livestock-raising became more important, and in the 1980s the <a href="lumber%20industry">lumber industry</a> boomed. In 1990, 6.6% of the region's territory was considered altered by anthropic (man-made) action, with state levels varying from 0.9% in Amapá to 14.0% in Rondônia.

In 1996 the North had 11.1 million inhabitants, only 7% of the national total. However, its share of Brazil's total had grown rapidly in the 1970s and early 1980s as a result of interregional migration, as well as high rates of natural increase. The largest population concentrations are in eastern Pará State and in Rondônia. The major cities are <a href="Bel%C3%A9m">Belém</a> and <a href="Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Par%C3%A1">Santarém</a> in Pará, and <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a> in Amazonas. Living standards are below the national average. The highest <a href="per%20capita%20income">per capita income</a>, US$2,888, in the region in 1994, was in Amazonas, while the lowest, US$901, was in Tocantins.

The Southeast consists of the four states of <a href="Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Espírito Santo</a>, <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28state%29">Rio de Janeiro</a>, and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a>. Its total area of corresponds to 10.9% of the national territory. The region has the largest share of the country's population, 63 million in 1991, or 39% of the national total, primarily as a result of internal migration since the mid-19th century until the 1980s. In addition to a dense urban network, it contains the megacities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which in 1991 had 18.7 million and 11.7 million inhabitants in their metropolitan areas, respectively. The region combines the highest living standards in Brazil with pockets of urban poverty. In 1994 São Paulo boasted an average income of US$4,666, while Minas Gerais reported only US$2,833.

Originally, the principal biome in the Southeast was the Atlantic Forest, but by 1990 less than 10% of the original forest cover remained as a result of clearing for farming, ranching, and charcoal making. Anthropic activity had altered 79.7% of the region, ranging from 75% in Minas Gerais to 91.1% in Espírito Santo. The region has most of Brazil's <a href="industrialization">industrial production</a>. The state of São Paulo alone accounts for half of the country's industries. Agriculture, also very strong, has diversified and now uses modern technology.

The three states in the temperate South: <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29">Paraná</a>, <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, and Santa Catarina—cover , or 6.8% of the national territory. The population of the South in 1991 was 23.1 million, or 14% of the country's total. The region is almost as densely settled as the Southeast, but the population is more concentrated along the coast. The major cities are <a href="Curitiba">Curitiba</a> and <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>. The inhabitants of the South enjoy relatively high living standards. Because of its industry and agriculture, Paraná had the highest average income in 1994, US$3,674, while Santa Catarina, a land of small farmers and small industries, had slightly less, US$3,405.

In addition to the <a href="Atlantic%20Forest">Atlantic Forest</a> and <a href="Araucaria%20moist%20forests">Araucaria moist forests</a>, much of which were cleared in the post-World War II period, the southernmost portion of Brazil contains the <a href="Uruguayan%20savanna">Uruguayan savanna</a>, which extends into <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and Uruguay. In 1982, 83.5% of the region had been altered by anthropic activity, with the highest level (89.7%) in Rio Grande do Sul, and the lowest (66.7%) in Santa Catarina. <a href="Agriculture">Agriculture</a>—much of which, such as <a href="rice">rice</a> production, is carried out by small farmers—has high levels of productivity. There are also some important industries.

The <a href="environmentalism">environmental problem</a> that attracted most international attention in Brazil in the 1980s was <a href="deforestation%20of%20the%20Amazon%20rainforest">deforestation in the Amazon</a>. Of all <a href="Latin%20American">Latin American</a> countries, Brazil still has the largest portion (66%) of its territory covered by forests, but <a href="Deforestation">clearing</a> and <a href="burning">burning</a> in the Amazon proceeded at alarming rates in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the clearing resulted from the activities of ranchers, including large corporate operations, and a smaller portion resulted from <a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash and burn</a> techniques used by small farmers. Technical changes involved in the transition from horizontal expansion of agriculture to increasing productivity also accounted for decreasing rates of deforestation.

<a href="Desertification">Desertification</a>, another important environmental problem in Brazil, only received international attention following the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> Conference on the Environment and Development, also known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Desertification means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are egraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid <a href="caatinga">caatinga</a> ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the risk of becoming even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.

In areas where agriculture is more intense and developed, there are serious problems of <a href="soil%20erosion">soil erosion</a>, <a href="silt">silt</a>ation and <a href="sedimentation">sedimentation</a> of streams and rivers, and pollution with <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s. In parts of the <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s, where irrigated <a href="soybean">soybean</a> production expanded in the 1980s, the <a href="water%20table">water table</a> has been affected. Expansion of pastures for cattle raising has reduced natural <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> in the savannas. Swine effluents constitute a serious environmental problem in Santa Catarina in the South.

In urban areas, at least in the largest cities, levels of <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a> and <a href="Traffic%20congestion">congestion</a> are typical of, or worse than, those found in cities in <a href="Developed%20country">developed countries</a>. At the same time, however, basic environmental problems related to the lack of <a href="sanitation">sanitation</a>, which developed countries solved long ago, persist in Brazil. These problems are sometimes worse in middle-sized and small cities than in large cities, which have more resources to deal with them. Environmental problems of cities and towns finally began to receive greater attention by society and the government in the 1990s.

According to many critics, the <a href="economic%20crisis">economic crisis</a> in the 1980s worsened environmental degradation in Brazil because it led to <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a> of <a href="natural%20resources">natural resources</a>, stimulated settlement in fragile lands in both rural and urban areas, and weakened environmental protection. At the same time, however, the lower level of economic activity may have reduced pressure on the environment, such as the aforementioned decreased level of investment in large-scale clearing in the Amazon. That pressure could increase if economic growth accelerates, especially if consumption patterns remain unchanged and more sustainable forms of production are not found.

In Brazil public policies regarding the <a href="Environment%20%28biophysical%29">environment</a> are generally advanced, although their implementation and the enforcement of <a href="environmental%20law">environmental law</a>s have been far from ideal. Laws regarding forests, water, and wildlife have been in effect since the 1930s. Brazil achieved significant institutional advances in environmental policy design and implementation after the Stockholm Conference on the Environment in 1972. Specialized environmental agencies were organized at the federal level and in some states, and many <a href="National%20park%20%28Brazil%29">national park</a>s and reserves were established. By 1992 Brazil had established 34 national parks and fifty-six <a href="Biological%20reserve%20%28Brazil%29">biological reserve</a>s. In 1981 the National Environment Policy was defined, and the National System for the Environment (Sistema Nacional do Meio Ambiente—Sisnama) was created, with the National Environmental Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente—Conama) at its apex, municipal councils at its base, and state-level councils in between. In addition to government authorities, all of these councils include representatives of civil society.

The 1988 constitution incorporates environmental precepts that are advanced compared with those of most other countries. At that time, the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Brazil">Chamber of Deputies</a> (Câmara dos Deputados) established its permanent Commission for Defense of the Consumer, the Environment, and Minorities. In 1989 the creation of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis--<a href="Ibama">Ibama</a>) joined together the federal environment secretariat and the federal agencies specializing in <a href="forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="rubber">rubber</a>, and fisheries. In 1990 the administration of <a href="Fernando%20Collor%20de%20Mello">Fernando Collor de Mello</a> (president, 1990–92) appointed the well-known environmentalist José Lutzemberger as secretary of the environment and took firm positions on the environment and on Indian lands. In 1992 Brazil played a key role at the <a href="Earth%20Summit">Earth Summit</a>, not only as its host but also as negotiator on sustainable development agreements, including the conventions on climate and biodiversity. The Ministry of Environment was created in late 1992, after President Collor had left office. In August 1993, it became the Ministry of Environment and the <a href="Legal%20Amazon">Legal Amazon</a> and took a more pragmatic approach than had the combative Lutzemberger. However, because of turnover in its leadership, a poorly defined mandate, and lack of funds, its role and impact were limited. In 1995 its mandate and name were expanded to include water resources—the Ministry of Environment, Hydraulic Resources, and the Legal Amazon—it began a process of restructuring to meet its mandate of "shared management of the sustainable use of natural resources." In 1997 the Commission on Policies for Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 began to function under the aegis of the Civil Household. One of its main tasks was to prepare Agenda 21 (a plan for the twenty-first century) for Brazil and to stimulate preparation of state and local agendas.

Institutional development at the official level was accompanied and in part stimulated by the growth, wide diffusion, and growing professional development of <a href="nongovernmental%20organization">nongovernmental organization</a>s (NGOs) dedicated to environmental and socio-environmental causes. The hundreds of NGOs throughout Brazil produce documents containing both useful information and passionate criticisms. Among the Brazilian environmental NGOs, the most visible are SOS Atlantic Forest (<a href="SOS%20Mata%20Atl%C3%A2ntica">SOS Mata Atlântica</a>), the Social-Environmental Institute (Instituto Sócio-Ambiental—ISA), the Pro-Nature Foundation (Fundação Pró-Natureza—Funatura), and the Amazon Working Group (Grupo de Trabalho Amazônico—GTA). The Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and Development and the Brazilian Association of Nongovernmental Organizations (Associacão Brasileira de Organizações Não-Governamentais—ABONG) are national networks, and there are various regional and thematic networks as well. The main international environmental NGOs that have offices or affiliates in Brazil are the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Conservation International (CI), and Nature Conservancy.

Especially after the events of the late 1980s, international organizations and developed countries have allocated significant resources for the environmental sector in Brazil. In 1992 environmental projects worth about US$6.8 million were identified, with US$2.6 in counterpart funds (funds provided by the Brazilian government). More than 70% of the total value was for sanitation, urban pollution control, and other urban environmental projects. Thus, the allocation of resources did not accord with the common belief that funding was influenced unduly by alarmist views on deforestation in the Amazon.

Among the specific environmental projects with international support, the most important was the National Environmental Plan (Plano Nacional do Meio Ambiente—PNMA), which received a US$117 million loan from the World Bank. The National Environmental Fund (Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente—FNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Proteção das Florestas Tropicais do Brasil—PPG-7) was supported by the world's seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rondônia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.

Despite favorable laws, promising institutional arrangements, and external funding, the government has not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it can be attributed to the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.

Politics of Brazil

The politics of Brazil take place in a framework of a <a href="federation">federal</a> <a href="presidential%20system">presidential</a> <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democratic</a> <a href="republic">republic</a>, whereby the <a href="President%20of%20Brazil">President</a> is both <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>, and of a <a href="multi-party%20system">multi-party system</a>. The political and administrative organization of <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> comprises the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20Brazil">federal government</a>, the 26 <a href="States%20of%20Brazil">states</a> and a <a href="Federal%20District%20%28Brazil%29">federal district</a>, and the <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Brazil">municipalities</a>.

The federal government exercises control over the <a href="central%20government">central government</a> and is divided into three independent branches: executive, legislative and judicial. <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the President, advised by a <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Brazil">cabinet</a>. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested upon the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">National Congress</a>, a two-chamber legislature comprising the <a href="Senate%20of%20Brazil">Federal Senate</a> and the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Brazil">Chamber of Deputies</a>. <a href="Judicial%20power">Judicial power</a> is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the <a href="Supreme%20Federal%20Court">Supreme Federal Court</a>, the <a href="Superior%20Court%20of%20Justice%20%28Brazil%29">Superior Court of Justice</a> and other <a href="Federal%20courts%20of%20Brazil">Superior Courts</a>, the <a href="National%20Justice%20Council">National Justice Council</a> and the <a href="Regional%20Federal%20Courts">Regional Federal Courts</a>.

The states are <a href="Autonomy">autonomous</a> <a href="Administrative%20division">sub-national entities</a> with their own governments that, together with the other federal units, form the Federative Republic of Brazil. Currently, Brazil is divided politically and administratively into 27 federal units, being 26 states and one federal district. The executive power is exercised by a <a href="governor">governor</a> elected to a four-year term. The judiciary is exercised by courts of first and second instance addressing the common justice. Each State has a unicameral <a href="legislature">legislature</a> with deputies who vote state laws. The Constitution of Brazil knows also two elements of <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a>, stated in Article 14. The legislative assemblies supervise the activities of the Executive power of the states and municipalities.

The <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Brazil">municipalities</a> are minor federal units of the Federative Republic of Brazil. Each municipality has an autonomous <a href="local%20government">local government</a>, comprising a <a href="mayor">mayor</a>, directly elected by the people to a four-year term, and a legislative body, also directly elected by the people.

Due to a mix of <a href="proportional%20voting">proportional voting</a> (the only <a href="first-past-the-post">first-past-the-post</a> elections are for the 1/3 of senate seats every 8 years and for mayors in small and medium-sized cities every 4 years), the lack of <a href="election%20threshold">election threshold</a> and the cultural aspects of <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>n "<a href="caudillismo">caudillismo</a>"-"<a href="coronelismo">coronelismo</a>", party politics in Brazil tends to be highly fragmented.

Brazil has had seven <a href="constitution">constitution</a>s:

According to sociologist Marcelo Ridenti, Brazilian politics is divided between internationalist <a href="liberalism">liberal</a>s and <a href="Statism">statist</a> nationalists. The first group consists of politicians arguing that internationalization of the <a href="economy%20of%20Brazil">economy</a> is essential for the development of the country, while the latter rely on <a href="interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionism</a>, and protection of <a href="Government-owned%20corporation">state enterprise</a>s. According to Ridenti, who cites the <a href="Fernando%20Henrique%20Cardoso">Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a> administration as an example of the first group and the <a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> administration as an example of the second, "we have it cyclically".

Lula's <a href="Workers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29">Workers' Party</a> tended to the statist nationalist side, although there are <a href="privatization">privatizing</a> forces within his party and government, while Cardoso's <a href="Brazilian%20Social%20Democratic%20Party">Social Democratic Party</a> tended to favor the international private market side by taking <a href="neoliberalism">neoliberal</a> policies. Lula compares himself with <a href="Get%C3%BAlio%20Vargas">Getúlio Vargas</a>, <a href="Juscelino%20Kubitscheck">Juscelino Kubitscheck</a> and <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Goulart">João Goulart</a>, presidents seen as statist nationalists.

As of May 2017, 16,668,589 Brazilians were affiliated with a <a href="political%20party">political party</a>. The largest parties are <a href="Brazilian%20Democratic%20Movement%20Party">PMDB</a> (which accounts for 14.4% of affiliated voters), the <a href="Workers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29">PT</a> (9.5% of affiliated voters), and <a href="Brazilian%20Social%20Democracy%20Party">PSDB</a> (8.7% of affiliated voters).

Brazil is a <a href="Federalism">federal</a> <a href="Presidential%20system">presidential</a> <a href="constitutional%20republic">constitutional republic</a>, based on <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democracy</a>. The federal government has three independent <a href="Separation%20of%20powers">branches</a>: executive, legislative, and judicial. <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the executive branch, headed by the <a href="President%20of%20Brazil">President</a>, advised by a <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Brazil">Cabinet</a>. The President is both the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and the <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested upon the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">National Congress</a>, a two-chamber legislature comprising the <a href="Senate%20of%20Brazil">Federal Senate</a> and the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Brazil">Chamber of Deputies</a>. <a href="Judicial%20power">Judicial power</a> is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the <a href="Supreme%20Federal%20Court">Supreme Federal Court</a>, the <a href="Superior%20Court%20of%20Justice%20%28Brazil%29">Superior Court of Justice</a> and other <a href="Federal%20courts%20of%20Brazil">Superior Courts</a>, the <a href="National%20Justice%20Council">National Justice Council</a> and the <a href="Regional%20Federal%20Courts">Regional Federal Courts</a>.

The 26 Brazilian "states" are semi-autonomous self-governing entities organized with complete administration branches, relative financial independence and their own set of symbols, similar to those owned by the country itself. Despite their relative autonomy they all have the same model of administration, as set by the Federal Constitution.

States hold elections every four years and exercise a considerable amount of power. The 1988 constitution allows states to keep their own taxes, set up <a href="State%20Senator%20%28Brazil%29">State Houses</a>, and mandates regular allocation of a share of the taxes collected locally by the federal government.

The Executive role is held by the "Governador" (Governor) and his appointed "Secretários" (Secretaries); the Legislative role is held by the "Assembléia Legislativa" (Legislative Assembly); and the Judiciary role, by the "Tribunal de Justiça" (Justice Tribunal). The governors and the members of the assemblies are elected, but the members of the Judiciary are appointed by the governor from a list provided by the current members of the State Law Court containing only judges (these are chosen by merit in exams open to anyone with a Law degree). The name chosen by the governor must be approved by the Assembly before inauguration. The 1988 Constitution has granted the states the greatest amount of autonomy since the Old Republic.

Each of the 26 state governors must achieve more than 50% of the vote, including a second round run-off between the top two candidates if necessary. In contrast to the federal level, state legislatures are unicameral, although the deputies are elected through similar means, involving an open-list system in which the state serves as one constituency. State level elections occur at the same time as those for the presidency and Congress. In 2002, candidates from eight different parties won the gubernatorial contest while 28 parties are represented in the country's state legislatures. The last set of elections took place in 2006.

The most important Brazilian states (in terms of population and economic power) are <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29">Paraná</a>, <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> and <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>.

Brazil has no clear distinction between "towns" and "cities" (in effect, the Portuguese word "cidade" means both). The only possible difference is regarding the municipalities that have a court of first instance and those that do not. The former are called "Sedes de Comarca" (seats of a "comarca", which is the territory under the rule of that court). Other than that, only size and importance differs one from another.

The municipality ("município") is a territory comprising one urban area, the "sede" (seat), from which it takes the name, and several other minor urban or rural areas, the "distritos" (districts). The seat of a municipality must be the most populous urban area within it; when another urban area grows too much it usually splits from the original municipality to form another one.

A municipality is relatively autonomous: it enacts its own "constitution", which is called "organic law" ("Lei Orgânica"), and it is allowed to collect taxes and fees, to maintain a municipal police force (albeit with very restricted powers), to pass laws on any matter that do not contradict either the state or the national constitutions, and to create symbols for itself (like a flag, an anthem and a coat-of-arms). However, not all municipalities exercise all of this autonomy. For instance, only a few municipalities keep local police forces, some of them do not collect some taxes (to attract investors or residents) and many of them do not have a flag (although they are all required to have a coat-of-arms).

Municipalities are governed by an elected "prefeito" (<a href="Mayor">Mayor</a>) and a unicameral "Câmara de Vereadores" (Councillors' Chamber). In municipalities with more than 200,000 voters, the Mayor must be elected by more than 50% of the valid vote. The executive power is called "Prefeitura".

Brazilian municipalities can vary widely in area and population. The municipality of <a href="Altamira%2C%20Brazil">Altamira</a>, in the State of <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a>, with 161,445.9 square kilometres of area, is larger than many countries in the world. Several Brazilian municipalities have over 1,000,000 inhabitants, with São Paulo, at more than 9,000,000, being the most populous.

Until 1974 Brazil had one state-level municipality, the <a href="State%20of%20Guanabara">State of Guanabara</a>, now merged with <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28state%29">the State of Rio de Janeiro</a>, which comprised <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28city%29">the city of Rio de Janeiro</a> solely.

The Federal District is an anomalous unit of the federation, as it is not organized in the same manner as a municipality, does not possess the same autonomy as a state (though usually ranked among them), and is closely related to the central power.

It is considered a single and indivisible entity, constituted by the seat, <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a> and some <a href="Satellite%20town">of the satellite cities</a>. Brasília and the satellite cities are governed by the <a href="Regional%20Administrator">Regional Administrator</a>s individually and as a whole are governed by the Governor of the Federal District.

Throughout its history, Brazil has struggled to build a <a href="democracy">democratic</a> and egalitarian society because of its origins as a <a href="plantation">plantation</a> colony and the strong influence of slavery.

In 1822 the <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Prince Pedro de Alcântara</a>, son of King <a href="John%20VI%20of%20Portugal">John VI of Portugal</a>, proclaimed the independence. He was the first Emperor (Pedro I) until his abdication in 1831 in favor of his elder son. Due to his young age (five years) a regency was established and the country had its first elections, though <a href="censitary%20vote">vote</a> was still restricted to a minority of the population.

In 1889, Marshal <a href="Deodoro%20da%20Fonseca">Deodoro da Fonseca</a> declared the republic, by a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>. Until 1930, Brazilian republic was formally a democracy, although the power was concentrated in the hands of powerful land owners.

In 1930, a bloodless <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a> led <a href="Get%C3%BAlio%20Vargas">Getúlio Vargas</a> to power. For about 15 years, he controlled the country's politics, with a brief three-year constitutional interregnum from 1934 to 1937. A longer, heavier regime, the "Estado Novo" had loose ties with European <a href="fascism">fascism</a> and spanned the years 1938 to 1945.

Like most of Latin America, Brazil experienced times of political instability after the Second World War. When Vargas was ousted from the presidency in another bloodless coup d'état, in 1945, a new and modern constitution was passed and the country had its first experience with an effective and widespread democracy. But the mounting tension between populist politicians (like Vargas himself and, later, <a href="J%C3%A2nio%20Quadros">Jânio Quadros</a>) and the right led to a crisis that ultimately brought up the military coup d'état in 1964, now known, through declassified documents, to have been supported by the American <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>.

In 1964 a military-led coup d'état deposed the democratically elected president of Brazil, João Goulart. Between 1964 and 1985, Brazil was governed by the military, with a <a href="two-party%20system">two-party system</a>, with a pro-government <a href="National%20Renewal%20Alliance%20Party">National Renewal Alliance Party</a> (ARENA) and an opposition <a href="Brazilian%20Democratic%20Movement">Brazilian Democratic Movement</a> (MDB). Thousands of politicians (including former president <a href="Juscelino%20Kubitschek">Juscelino Kubitschek</a>) had their political rights suspended, and military-sanctioned indirect elections were held for most elected positions until political liberalization during the government of <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Figueiredo">João Figueiredo</a>.

In 1985, the military were defeated in an election according to the scheme they had set up as a consequence of the loss of political support among the elites. The opposition candidate, <a href="Tancredo%20Neves">Tancredo Neves</a>, was elected President, but died of natural causes before he was able to take office. Fearing a political vacuum that might stifle the democratic effort, Neves' supporters urged vice-president, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Sarney">José Sarney</a> to take the oath and govern the country. Tancredo Neves had said that his election and the demise of military régime would create a "New Republic" and Sarney's term of government is often referred to by this name.

Sarney's government was disastrous in almost every field. The ongoing <a href="recession">recession</a> and the soaring <a href="external%20debt">external debt</a> drained the country's assets while ravaging <a href="inflation">inflation</a> (which later turned into <a href="hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a>) demonetized the currency and prevented any stability. In an attempt to revolutionize the economy and defeat inflation, Sarney carried on an ambitious "heterodox" economic plan (<a href="Cruzado">Cruzado</a>) in 1986, which included price controls, default on the external debts and reduction of salaries. The plan seemed successful for some months, but it soon caused wholesale shortages of consumer goods (especially of easily exportable goods like meat, milk, automobiles, grains, sugar and alcohol) and the appearance of a black market in which such goods were sold for higher prices. Buoyed by the ensuing popularity from the apparent success of the plan, Sarney secured the largest electoral win in Brazilian history; the party he had just joined, <a href="Brazilian%20Democratic%20Movement%20Party">Brazilian Democratic Movement Party</a> (PMDB), won in 26 out of 27 states and in more than 3,000 municipalities. Just after the elections, Sarney's "corrections" to the economy failed to control inflation and the public perception that he had used an artificial control of inflation to win the elections proved to be his undoing. His popularity never recovered and he was plagued by vehement criticism from most sectors of society until the end of his term. Despite popular rejection, Sarney managed to extend his term from four to five years, and exerted pressure on the Constitutional Assembly that was drafting the new constitution to abort the adoption of <a href="Parliamentarism">Parliamentarism</a>.

In 1989 Fernando Collor de Mello was elected president for the term from 1990–1994. The elections were marked by unanimous condemnation of <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Sarney">José Sarney</a>, with all candidates trying to keep distance from him.

Collor made some very bold statements, like saying that the Brazilian industry (of which the Brazilians used to be very proud) was mostly obsolete and polluting or that defaulting the debt was equal to not paying the rent. He also took quite revolutionary measures, like reducing the number of ministries to only 12 and naming <a href="Z%C3%A9lia%20Cardoso%20de%20Mello">Zélia Cardoso de Mello</a> Minister of Economy or removing existing barriers to importing of goods.

His inflation control plan was based on an attempt to control prices and a complicated currency conversion process that prevented people from cashing their bank accounts for 18 months.

All of this made him quite unpopular and denied him support in the parliament that he needed since his own party held few seats. At the beginning of his third year in office, he resigned as a result of in a huge corruption scandal. The charges against him would later be dropped, some on mere technicalities, some for actually being irrelevant or false.

Collor desperately tried to resist <a href="impeachment">impeachment</a> by rallying the support of the youth and of the lower classes, but his call for help was answered by massive popular demonstrations, led mostly by students, demanding his resignation.

In 1992, the vice-president, Itamar Franco, took office as president and managed to evade the most feared consequences of Collor's downfall. He had to face a country with hyper-inflation, high levels of misery and unemployment. Far-left organizations were trying to turn the anti-Collor campaign into a wider revolutionary fight to overthrow the regime. Itamar finally granted full powers to his Minister of Economy, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, so the minister could launch the <a href="Plano%20Real">Plano Real</a>, a new economic plan that seemed to be just the same as the many unsuccessful plans launched by Sarney, Collor and their military predecessor. But the Real was a success, and terminated inflation in a few months.

In 1994, Cardoso launched his <a href="Plano%20Real">Plano Real</a>, a successful economic reform that managed to permanently rid the country of the excessive inflation that had plagued it for more than forty years. The plan consisted of replacing the discredited old currency (<a href="Brazilian%20cruzeiro">cruzeiro</a> and <a href="Brazilian%20cruzeiro%20real">cruzeiro real</a>) and pegging its value temporarily to the United States dollar. Inflation – which had become a fact of Brazilian life – was cut dramatically, a change that the Brazilians took years to get used to. Because of the success of Plano Real, Cardoso was chosen by his party to run for president and, with the strong support of Franco, eventually won, beating <a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a>, who had emerged as the favorite only one year earlier.

Cardoso's term was marked by other major changes in Brazilian politics and economy. Public services and state-owned companies were <a href="privatization">privatized</a> (some for values supposedly too cheap according to his adversaries), the strong <a href="Brazilian%20real">real</a> made it easy to import goods, forcing Brazilian industry to modernize and compete (which had the side effect of causing many of them to be bought by foreign companies). During his first term, a constitutional amendment was passed to enable a sitting Executive chief to run for re-election, after which he again beat Lula in 1998.

In 2002, at his fourth attempt, Lula was elected president. In part his victory was derived from the considerable unpopularity of Cardoso's second term, which failed to decrease the economic inequality, and in part from a softening of his and the party's radical stance, including a vice-presidential candidate from the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28Brazil%29">Liberal Party</a>, acceptance of an <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) accord agreed to by the previous government and a line of discourse friendly to the financial markets.

Despite some achievements in solving part of the country's biggest problems, his term was plagued by multiple corruption scandals that rocked his cabinet, forcing some members to resign their posts.

In 2006 Lula regained part of his popularity and ran for re-election. After almost winning on the first round, he won the run-off against <a href="Geraldo%20Alckmin">Geraldo Alckmin</a> from the <a href="Brazilian%20Social%20Democracy%20Party">Brazilian Social Democracy Party</a> (PSDB), by a margin of 20 million votes.

In 2010, Lula's handpicked successor, <a href="Dilma%20Rousseff">Dilma</a>, was elected to the Presidency.

Economy of Brazil

The economy of <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> is the world's ninth <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29">largest</a> economy by nominal GDP and <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29">eighth largest</a> by <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a>. The Brazilian economy is characterized by a <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a> that relies on import substitution to achieve economic growth. Brazil has an estimated US$21.8 trillion worth of <a href="natural%20resources">natural resources</a> which includes vast amounts of <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="iron">iron</a>, and <a href="timber">timber</a>. 

As of late 2010, Brazil's economy is the largest of Latin America and the second largest in the Americas. From 2000 to 2012, Brazil was one of the <a href="economic%20growth">fastest-growing</a> major economies in the world, with an average annual GDP growth rate of over 5%, with its economy in 2012 surpassing that of the United Kingdom, temporarily making Brazil the world's sixth largest economy. However, Brazil's economy growth decelerated in 2013
and the country <a href="2014%E2%80%932016%20Brazilian%20economic%20recession">entered a recession in 2014</a>. In 2017, however, the economy started to recover, with a 1% GDP growth in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the economy growth 0.3% compared to the same period of the previous year, officially exiting the recession.

According to the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a>, Brazil was the top country in upward evolution of <a href="competitiveness">competitiveness</a> in 2009, gaining eight positions among other countries, overcoming Russia for the first time, and partially closing the competitiveness gap with <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="China">China</a> among the <a href="BRIC">BRIC</a> economies. Important steps taken since the 1990s toward fiscal sustainability, as well as measures taken to liberalize and open the economy, have significantly boosted the country's competitiveness fundamentals, providing a better environment for private-sector development.

In 2012 <a href="Forbes">Forbes</a> ranked Brazil as having the 5th largest number of billionaires in the world, a number much larger than what is found in other Latin American countries, and even ahead of United Kingdom and Japan. Brazil is a member of diverse economic organizations, such as <a href="Mercosur">Mercosur</a>, <a href="Union%20of%20South%20American%20Nations">Unasul</a>, <a href="G8%2B5">G8+5</a>, <a href="G-20%20major%20economies">G20</a>, <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">WTO</a>, and the <a href="Cairns%20Group">Cairns Group</a>.

When the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portuguese</a> explorers arrived in the 16th century, the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20Brazil">native tribes of current-day Brazil</a>, totaled about 2.5  million people and had lived virtually unchanged since the <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>. From Portugal's colonization of Brazil (1500–1822) until the late 1930s, the Brazilian economy relied on the production of <a href="primary%20products">primary products</a> for exports. In the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a>, Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial <a href="mercantile">mercantile</a> policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles – sugar, gold and from the early 19th century on, coffee. The economy of Brazil was heavily dependent on African slave labor until the late 19th century (about 3 million imported African slaves in total). In that period Brazil was also the colony with the largest amount of European settlers, most of them Portuguese (including Azoreans and Madeirans) but also some Dutch (see <a href="Dutch%20Brazil">Dutch Brazil</a>), Spaniards, English, French, Germans, Flemish, Danish, Scottish and Sephardic <a href="Brazilian%20Jews">Jews</a>. Since then, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic growth accompanied by mass immigration from Europe, mainly from <a href="Portuguese%20Brazilian">Portugal</a> (including the Azores and Madeira), <a href="Italian%20Brazilian">Italy</a>, <a href="Spanish%20Brazilian">Spain</a>, <a href="German%20Brazilian">Germany</a>, <a href="Polish%20Brazilian">Poland</a>, <a href="Ukrainian%20Brazilian">Ukraine</a>, <a href="Swiss%20Brazilian">Switzerland</a>, <a href="Austrian%20Brazilian">Austria</a> and Russia. Smaller numbers of immigrants also came from the <a href="Dutch%20Brazilian">Netherlands</a>, <a href="French%20Brazilian">France</a>, <a href="Finnish%20Brazilian">Finland</a>, <a href="Icelandic%20Brazilian">Iceland</a> and the <a href="Scandinavian%20Brazilian">Scandinavian</a> countries, <a href="Lithuanians%20in%20Brazil">Lithuania</a>, <a href="Belgian%20Brazilian">Belgium</a>, <a href="Bulgarian%20Brazilian">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Hungarian%20Brazilian">Hungary</a>, <a href="Greek%20Brazilian">Greece</a>, <a href="Latvian%20Brazilian">Latvia</a>, <a href="English%20Brazilian">England</a>, <a href="Irish%20Brazilian">Ireland</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Brazilian">Scotland</a>, <a href="Croat%20Brazilian">Croatia</a>, <a href="Czech%20Brazilian">Czech Republic</a>, <a href="Maltese%20Brazilian">Malta</a>, <a href="Macedonians%20in%20Brazil">Macedonia</a> and <a href="Luxembourg%20Brazilian">Luxembourg</a>), the <a href="Arab%20Brazilian">Middle East</a> (mainly from <a href="Lebanese%20Brazilian">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Syrian%20Brazilian">Syria</a> and <a href="Armenian%20Brazilian">Armenia</a>), Japan, the <a href="Confederados">United States</a> and <a href="Afrikaners">South Africa</a>, until the 1930s. In the New World, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Uruguay, New Zealand, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, Paraguay, Puerto Rico and Peru (in descending order) were the countries that received most immigrants. In Brazil's case, statistics showed that 4.5  million people emigrated to the country between 1882 and 1934.

Currently, with a population of over 204 million and abundant natural resources, Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of millions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5  million television sets, and 3  million refrigerators. In addition, about 70  million cubic meters of petroleum were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane gas, and a wide range of hundred petrochemicals.

Brazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads, more than 93 Gigawatts of installed electric power capacity and its real per capita GDP surpassed US$10,500 in 2008, due to the strong and continued appreciation of the <a href="Brazilian%20real">real</a> for the first time that decade. Its industrial sector accounts for three-fifths of the Latin American economy's industrial production. The country's <a href="Brazilian%20science%20and%20technology">scientific and technological</a> development is argued to be attractive to <a href="foreign%20direct%20investment">foreign direct investment</a>, which has averaged US$30  billion per year the last years, compared to only US$2 billion per year last decade, remarkable growth. The agricultural sector, locally called the "agronegócio" (agro-business), has also been remarkably dynamic: for two decades this sector has kept Brazil among the most highly productive countries in areas related to the rural sector. The agricultural sector and the mining sector also supported trade surpluses which allowed for massive currency gains (rebound) and external debt paydown. Due to a downturn in Western economies, Brazil found itself in 2010 trying to halt the appreciation of the real.

Data from the <a href="Asian%20Development%20Bank">Asian Development Bank</a> and the <a href="Tax%20Justice%20Network">Tax Justice Network</a> show the untaxed "shadow" economy of Brazil is 39% of GDP.

The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 67.0 percent, followed by the industrial sector at 27.5 percent. Agriculture represents 5.5 percent of GDP (2011). Brazilian labor force is estimated at 100.77 million of which 10 percent is occupied in agriculture, 19 percent in the industry sector and 71 percent in the service sector.

Agribusiness contributes to Brazil's <a href="trade%20balance">trade balance</a>, in spite of trade barriers and subsidizing policies adopted by the developed countries.

In the space of fifty five years (1950 to 2005), the population of Brazil grew from 51 million to approximately 187 million inhabitants, an increase of over 2 percent per year. Brazil created and expanded a complex <a href="agribusiness">agribusiness</a> sector. However, some of this is at the expense of the environment, including the <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon</a>.

The importance given to the rural producer takes place in the shape of the agricultural and cattle-raising plan and through another specific subsidy program geared towards family agriculture (<a href="Pronaf">Pronaf</a>), which guarantee financing for equipment and cultivation and encourage the use of new technology. With regards to family agriculture, over 800 thousand rural inhabitants are assisted by credit, research and extension programs. A special line of credit is available for women and young farmers.

With The Land Reform Program, on the other hand, the country's objective is to provide suitable living and working conditions for over one million families who live in areas allotted by the State, an initiative capable of generating two million <a href="Employment">jobs</a>. Through partnerships, public policies and international partnerships, the government is working towards the guarantee of an infrastructure for the settlements, following the examples of schools and health outlets. The idea is that access to land represents just the first step towards the implementation of a quality land reform program.

Over 600,000 km² of land are divided into approximately five thousand areas of rural <a href="property">property</a>; an agricultural area currently with three borders: the <a href="Central-West%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Central-western region</a> (savanna), the <a href="North%20Region%2C%20Brazil">northern region</a> (area of transition) and parts of the <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">northeastern region</a> (semi-arid). At the forefront of grain crops, which produce over 110 million tonnes/year, is the soybean, yielding 50 million tonnes.

In the cattle-raising sector, the "green ox," which is raised in pastures, on a diet of hay and mineral salts, conquered markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas, particularly after the "<a href="Bovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy">mad cow disease</a>" scare period. Brazil has the largest cattle herd in the world, with 198 million heads, responsible for exports surpassing the mark of US$1 billion/year.

A pioneer and leader in the manufacture of short-fiber timber <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, Brazil has also achieved positive results within the packaging sector, in which it is the fifth largest world producer. In the foreign markets, it answers for 25 percent of global exports of raw cane and refined sugar; it is the world leader in <a href="soybean">soybean</a> exports and is responsible for 80 percent of the planet's orange juice, and since 2003, has had the highest sales figures for beef and chicken, among the countries that deal in this sector.

Brazil has the third-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and <a href="consumer%20durable">consumer durable</a>s. With increased economic stability provided by the <a href="Plano%20Real">Plano Real</a>, Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from US firms.

Brazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16 percent of the GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazil's financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. On 8 May 2008, the São Paulo Stock Exchange (<a href="Bovespa">Bovespa</a>) and the São Paulo-based Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&F) merged, creating <a href="BM%26amp%3BF%20Bovespa">BM&F Bovespa</a>, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world. Also, the previously monopolistic reinsurance sector is being opened up to third party companies.

Proven mineral resources are extensive. Large iron and manganese reserves are important sources of industrial raw materials and export earnings. Deposits of nickel, tin, chromite, uranium, bauxite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten, zinc, gold, and other minerals are exploited. High-quality coking-grade coal required in the steel industry is in short supply.

In 2017, 20 Brazilian companies were listed in the <a href="Forbes%20Global%202000">Forbes Global 2000</a> list – an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by <a href="Forbes%20magazine">Forbes magazine</a>. The 20 companies listed were:

The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil is one of the world's leading producers of hydroelectric power, with a current capacity of about 260,000 megawatts. Existing hydroelectric power provides 90% of the nation's electricity. Two large hydroelectric projects, the 19,900 megawatt <a href="Itaipu%20Dam">Itaipu Dam</a> on the <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20River">Paraná River</a> (the world's largest dam) and the Tucurui Dam in <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a> in <a href="North%20Region%2C%20Brazil">northern Brazil</a>, are in operation. Brazil's first commercial nuclear reactor, <a href="Angra%20I">Angra I</a>, located near <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, has been in operation for more than 10 years. <a href="Angra%20II">Angra II</a> was completed in 2002 and is in operation too. An <a href="Angra%20III">Angra III</a> had a planned inauguration scheduled for 2014. The three reactors would have a combined capacity of 9,000 megawatts when completed. The government also plans to build 19 more nuclear plants by the year 2020.

Portuguese explorers arrived in 1500, but it was only in 1808 that Brazil obtained a permit from the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese colonial government</a> to set up its first factories and manufacturers. In the 21st century, Brazil reached the status of 8th largest economy in the world. Originally, the exports were basic raw and primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold. Today, 84% of exports are of manufactured and semi-manufactured products.

The period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875 and 1975.

In the last decade, domestic production increased by 32.3%. <a href="Agribusiness">Agribusiness</a> (agriculture and cattle-raising), which grew by 47% or 3.6% per year, was the most dynamic sector – even after having weathered international crises that demanded constant adjustments to the Brazilian economy. The Brazilian government also launched a program for economic development acceleration called <a href="Programa%20de%20Acelera%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20do%20Crescimento">Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento</a>, aiming to spur growth.

Brazil's transparency rank in the international world is 75th according to <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a>.

Among measures recently adopted to <a href="Balance%20%28accounting%29">balance</a> the economy, Brazil carried out reforms to its social security (state and retirement pensions) and tax systems. These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of Fiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the executive branches at federal, state and municipal levels. At the same time, investments were made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to encourage exports, industry and trade, thus creating "windows of opportunity" for local and international investors and producers.

With these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it doesn't import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic debt through exchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by 20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector or inflation (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a <a href="liquidity%20crisis">liquidity crisis</a>. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive balance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments, services and overseas payment. Thus, respected economists say that the country won't be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.

In 2017, President <a href="Michel%20Temer">Michel Temer</a> refuses to make public the list of companies accused of "<a href="modern%20slavery">modern slavery</a>". The list, made public since the presidency of <a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva">Lula Da Silva</a> in 2003, ad to oblige companies to settle their fines and to conform to the regulations in a country where corruption of the political class by the private sector would have risked to compromise the respect for the law. The relations of the president-in-office with the "landowner lobby" were denounced by the dismissed president <a href="Dilma%20Rousseff">Dilma Rousseff</a> on this occasion.

Support for the productive sector has been simplified at all levels; active and independent, <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">Congress</a> and the Judiciary Branch carry out the evaluation of rules and regulations. Among the main measures taken to stimulate the economy are the reduction of up to 30 percent on manufactured products tax (IPI), and the investment of $8 billion on road cargo transportation fleets, thus improving distribution logistics. Further resources guarantee the propagation of business and information telecenters.

The policy for industry, technology and foreign trade, at the forefront of this sector, for its part, invests $19.5 billion in specific sectors, following the example of the software and semiconductor, pharmaceutical and medicine product, and capital goods sectors.

Between 1993 and 2010, 7.012 <a href="Mergers%20and%20acquisitions">mergers & acquisitions</a> with a total known value of US$707 billion with the involvement of Brazilian firms have been announced. The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with $115 billion of transactions. The largest transaction with involvement of Brazilian companies has been: <a href="Vale%20%28mining%20company%29">Cia Vale do Rio Doce</a> acquired <a href="Vale%20Inco">Inco</a> in a tender offer valued at $18.9 billion.

According to a search of <a href="Global%20Entrepreneurship%20Monitor">Global Entrepreneurship Monitor</a> in 2011 Brazil had 27 million adults aged between 18 and 64 either starting or owning a business, meaning that more than one in four Brazilian adults were entrepreneurs. In comparison to the other 54 countries studied, Brazil was the third-highest in total number of entrepreneurs. Ipea, a government agency, found that 37 million jobs in Brazil were associated with businesses with up to 10 employees.

Even though Brazil ranks internationally as one of the hardest countries in the region to do business due to its complicated bureaucracy. There is a healthy number of entrepreneurs, thanks to the huge market and the government programs.

The most recent research of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor revealed in 2013 that 50.4% of Brazilian new entrepreneurs are men, 33.8% are in the 35–44 age group, 36.9% completed high school and 47.9% earn 3–6 times the Brazilian minimum wage. In contrast, 49.6% of entrepreneurs are female, only 7% are in the 55–64 age group, 1% have postgraduate education and 1.7% earn more than 9 times the minimum wage.

Brazil's credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor's to BBB in March 2014, just one notch above junk.

Brazil is a country with extreme differences in wages. Members of the national congress make R$33,700 per month, plus an additional 13th salary, totaling R$444,800 per year (USD 140,000), but most of the population only makes <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a> set for the year of 2017 at R$937 per month plus an additional 13th salary in the second half of December, totaling R$12,181 per year (around USD 4,000), which is 35 times less than national politicians. The <a href="GDP%20per%20capita">GDP per capita</a> in 2011 was US$12,906.

Statistics


The history of mobile telephony in Brazil began on 30 December 1990, when the Cellular Mobile System began operating in the city of Rio de Janeiro, with a capacity for 10,000 terminals. At that time, according to Anatel (the national telecommunications agency), there were 667 devices in the country. The number of devices rose to 6,700 in the next year, to 30,000 in 1992. In November 2007 3G services were launched, and increased rapidly to almost 90% of the population in 2012 and the agreements signed as part of the auction specify a 3G coverage obligation of 100% of population by 2019. After the auction that took place in June 2012, LTE tests were undertaken in several cities, tourist locations and international conference venues. The first LTE-compatible devices became available in the local market and LTE services was commercially launched in 2013. Under the 4G licence terms, operators were required to have commercial networks in all twelve state capitals which are acting as host cities for the <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2014 FIFA World Cup</a>.

Transport in Brazil

Transport infrastructure in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> is characterized by strong regional differences and lack of development of the national rail network. Brazil's fast-growing economy, and especially the growth in exports, will place increasing demands on the transport networks. However, sizeable new investments that are expected to address some of the issues are either planned or in progress.

Brazilian Armed Forces

The Brazilian Armed Forces (, ) is the unified <a href="military">military</a> organization comprising the <a href="Brazilian%20Army">Brazilian Army</a> (including the <a href="Brazilian%20Army%20Aviation%20Command">Brazilian Army Aviation</a>), the <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian Navy</a> (including the <a href="Brazilian%20Marine%20Corps">Brazilian Marine Corps</a> and <a href="Brazilian%20Naval%20Aviation">Brazilian Naval Aviation</a>) and the <a href="Brazilian%20Air%20Force">Brazilian Air Force</a>.

Brazil's armed forces are the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20number%20of%20military%20and%20paramilitary%20personnel">third largest</a> in the Americas, after the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States</a> and <a href="Military%20Forces%20of%20Colombia">Colombia</a>, and the largest in Latin America by the level of military equipment, with 318,480 active-duty troops and officers. With no serious external or internal threats, the armed forces are searching for a new role. They are expanding their presence in the Amazon under the Northern Corridor (Calha Norte) program. In 1994 Brazilian troops joined <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) peacekeeping forces in five countries. Brazilian soldiers have been in Haiti since 2004 leading the United Nations Stabilization Mission (<a href="MINUSTAH">MINUSTAH</a>).

The Brazilian military, especially the army, has become more involved in civic-action programs, education, health care, and constructing roads, bridges, and railroads across the nation. Although the <a href="Brazilian%20Constitution">1988 constitution</a> preserves the external and internal roles of the armed forces, it places the military under presidential authority. Thus, the new charter changed the manner in which the military could exercise its moderating power.

The Armed Forces of Brazil are divided into 3 branches:

The <a href="Military%20Police%20%28Brazil%29">Military Police</a> (state police) alongside the <a href="Military%20Firefighters%20Corps">Military Firefighters Corps</a> are described as an auxiliary and reserve force of the Army. All military branches are part of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Brazil%29">Ministry of Defence</a>.

The <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian Navy</a> which is the oldest of the Brazilian Armed Forces, includes the <a href="Brazilian%20Marine%20Corps">Brazilian Marine Corps</a> and the <a href="Brazilian%20Naval%20Aviation">Brazilian Naval Aviation</a>.

19–45 years of age for compulsory military service; conscript service obligation – 9 to 12 months; 17–45 years of age for voluntary service. An increasing percentage of the ranks are "long-service" volunteer professionals; women were allowed to serve in the armed forces beginning in the early 1980s when the Brazilian Army became the first army in South America to accept women into career ranks; women serve in Navy and Air Force only in Women's Reserve Corps.

South America is a relatively peaceful continent in which wars are a rare event; as a result, Brazil hasn't had its territory invaded since year 1865 during the <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a>. Additionally, Brazil has no contested territorial disputes with any of its neighbours and neither does it have rivalries, like <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> have with each other. However, Brazil is the only country besides China and Russia that has land borders with 10 or more nations. Moreover, Brazil has of land borders and of coastline to be patrolled and defended. Overall, the Armed Forces have to defend 8.5 million km (around 3.2 million sq. mi.) of land and patrol 4.4 million km (around 1.7 million sq. mi.) of <a href="territorial%20waters">territorial waters</a> – or "Blue Amazon", as the <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian Navy</a> calls them. In order to achieve this mission properly, significant quantities of both manpower and funding have to be made available.

Since 1648 the Brazilian Armed Forces have been relied upon to fight in defense of Brazilian sovereignty and to suppress civil rebellions. The Brazilian military has also four times intervened militarily to overthrow the <a href="Government%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian government</a>.

The Brazilian Armed Forces were subordinated to the Emperor, its <a href="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a>. He was aided by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Brazil%29">Ministers of War and Navy</a> in regard to matters concerning the <a href="Brazilian%20Army">Army</a> and the <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Armada</a>, respectively. Traditionally, the Ministers of War and Navy were civilians but there were some exceptions. The model chosen was the British parliamentary or Anglo-American system, in which "the country's Armed Forces observed <a href="Civilian%20control%20of%20the%20military">unrestricted obedience</a> to the civilian government while maintaining distance from political decisions and decisions referring to borders' security".

The military personnel were allowed to run and serve in political offices while staying on active duty. However, they did not represent the Army or the Armada but instead the population of the city or province where elected. <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Dom Pedro I</a> chose nine military personnel as <a href="Senate%20of%20Brazil">Senators</a> and five (out of 14) to the State Council. During the Regency, two were chosen to the Senate and none to the State Council as there was no Council at the time. <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Dom Pedro II</a> chose four military personnel to become Senators during the 1840s, two in the 1850s and three until the end of his reign. He also chose seven military personnel to be State Counselors during the 1840s and 1850s and three after that.

It has built a tradition of participating in UN <a href="peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a> missions such as in <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a>. Below a list of some of the historical events in which the Brazilian Armed Forces took part:

Brazilian Expeditionary Force, initially composed of an infantry division, eventually covered all Brazilian military forces who participated in the conflict, including the Brazilian Air Force who did a remarkable job in the last nine months of war with 445 missions executed. Offensive: 2546, Defensive: 4.).

Although no military coups occurred during the 67 years of the <a href="Brazilian%20Empire">Brazilian Empire</a>, the Republican period experienced 4 military coups d'état in the 75 years between 1889 and 1964.

Today, few countries do not bring their Armed Forces under one defense agency, subordinate to the Head of the Executive. In Brazil, until 1999, the three Armed Forces remained in independent ministries. However, the quarrel over the creation of a single Ministry of Defense, integrating the Navy, the Army and the Aeronautics is old. The 1946 Constitution already cited the creation of just one Ministry, that resulted in the institution of the E.M.F.A, at the time called General staff. Ex-President of the Republic <a href="Humberto%20de%20Alencar%20Castelo%20Branco">Castelo Branco</a>, defended the thesis of the creation of a Ministry of the Defense. It signed Decree 200, of 25 February 1967, that the Ministry of the Armed Forces foresaw the promotion of studies to elaborate the law project creating. However, the proposal was abandoned. During the Constitutional conventional of 1988, the subject came back to the quarrel and one more time it was filed. Finally in 1992, President <a href="Fernando%20Henrique%20Cardoso">Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a>, then candidate to the Presidency, declared that in its plan of government the quarrel for creation of the Ministry of Defense was foreseen.

The President of the Republic still intended to create a Ministry in his first term. The idea was to optimize the system of national defense, to legalize one politics of sustainable defense and to integrate the three Forces, rationalizing their activities. But only on 10 June 1999, the Ministry of the Defense was officially created, the General staff of the Armed Forces abolished and the <a href="Aeronautic">Aeronautic</a>s , Army, and Navy Ministries had been transformed into Service Commands. During the years of 1995/96 the EMFA, responsible for the studies on the Ministry of Defense, evidenced that, amongst 179 countries, only 23 did not have integrated Armed Forces. Of these 23, only three, amongst them Brazil, had dimensions politics to justify its creation, as for example, territorial extension and trained and structuralized Armed Forces. The Ministries of Defense of Germany, Argentina, Chile, Spain, USA, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Portugal had been chosen for deepened analysis because they had some type of identification with Brazil, as territorial extension, population, cash of the Armed Forces, amongst others.

To give continuity to the creation studies, President Fernando Henrique created the Inter-ministerial Work group that defined the lines of direction for implantation of the Ministry of Defense. Reelected, he nominated senator Élcio Álvares, Extraordinary minister of the Defense, on 1 January 1999. The former <a href="Senate%20of%20Brazil">senator</a> was the responsible one for the implementation of the agency. The three services are separate from each other, except in three areas: the Armed Forces General Staff (Estado-Maior das Forças Armadas-EMFA), the National Defense Council (Conselho de Defesa Nacional-CDN), and the Armed Forces High Command (Alto Comando das Forças Armadas-ACFA). The EMFA, which is involved in planning and coordination, interprets interservice views about policy and comes the closest to functioning as a ministry of defense. It is headed by a four-star general, and the chair rotates among the services. The ACFA is involved with more immediate, day-to-day problems. It is composed of the ministers of the three services, their chiefs of staff, and the EMFA chief.

According to Article 91 of the constitution, the CDN is "the consultative body of the president of the republic in matters related to national sovereignty and the defense of the democratic state." The members of the CDN are the president, the vice president, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the president of the Senate, the minister of justice, military ministers, the minister of foreign affairs, and the minister of planning. The CDN has authority to "express an opinion in instances of declaration of war and the celebration of peace" and to "express an opinion on the decreeing of a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a>, <a href="state%20of%20siege">state of siege</a>, or <a href="federal%20intervention">federal intervention</a>." In addition, the CDN is authorized to "propose the criteria and conditions for the use of areas that are vital to the security of the national territory and express an opinion on their continued use, especially in the strip along the borders, and on matters related to the conservation and exploitation of natural resources of any kind." The CDN also may "study, propose, and monitor the progress of initiatives necessary to guarantee national independence and the defense of the democratic state."

The highest level consultative body available to the president is the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20Republic%20%28Brazil%29">Council of the Republic</a> (Conselho da República). This body does not include any military minister or officer, although the president may call on a military minister to participate if the matter is related to the respective ministry's agenda. According to Article 89 of the constitution, the Council of the Republic has authority to make declarations of federal intervention, a state of emergency, and a state of siege (all security-related issues).

Joint Staff of the Armed Forces is an agency of the Ministry of Defense of Brazil, which centralizes the coordination of command of the armed forces: Army, Navy and Air Force. It was created by Complementary Law No. 136 of 25 August 2010, and has in Ordinance No. 1429 its operating guidelines.

Advising the Minister of Defense in the upper direction of the armed forces, aiming the organization, preparation and employment, in order to fulfill its constitutional mission and its subsidiaries assignments, with the goals strategic planning and the joint use of the military services.

It is up to JSAF plan together and integrated employment of staff of the Navy, Army and Air Force, optimizing the use of the military and logistical support in the defense of the country and in peacekeeping, humanitarian and rescue operations; border security; and civil defense actions.

The body has its powers and duties according to the Regimental Structure approved by Decree 7.9744, April 1, 2013.

Since its inception, the JSAF has worked with the Central Administration of the Ministry of Defence, on the Esplanade of Ministries in Brasilia (DF).

The head of the JSAF is private of a general officer of the last post, active or reserve, designated by the Ministry of Defence and appointed by the president. Their hierarchical level is the same of the military commanders of the Navy, Army and Air Force.

Under the coordination of the Joint Armed Forces also operates the Committee of Chiefs of Staffs of the military services.

The current head of JSAF is Admiral-of-Fleet Ademir Sobrinho.

As in most South American nations, the Brazilian Army (, ) has been the most influential of the services because of its size, deployment, and historical development. Not only did senior army generals occupy the presidency from 1964 until 1985, but most of the officers who held cabinet posts during that time were from the army. In 1997 the army totaled 200,000 members. Brazil's army has strict up-or-out retirement rules, which were developed in the mid-1960s by President <a href="Humberto%20de%20Alencar%20Castelo%20Branco">Castelo Branco</a>. The internal command structure determines all promotions through the rank of colonel. The president is involved in the promotions to general and chooses one candidate from a list of three names presented to him by the High Command. Once passed over, the colonel must retire. All colonels must retire at age fifty-nine; and all four-star generals must retire at age sixty-six, or after 12 years as general.

Despite the up-or-out system, under President <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Sarney">José Sarney</a> the army became top-heavy as generals began to occupy many positions that previously had been reserved for colonels. In 1991 there were 15 four-star, forty three-star, and 110 two-star generals. The figure for four-star generals did not include four who were ministers in the Superior Military Court (Superior Tribunal Militar-STM). Thus, in the mid-1990s the army sought to reduce the number of active-duty generals. Considering the short conscript tour (usually nine to ten months), the army has a high number of conscripts: 125,000. Because of the need for literate and skilled young men to handle modern weapons, the army has served as a training ground for a large reserve force. Its highly professional officer corps serves as a nucleus around which the trained service would be mobilized if required.

The noncommissioned officer (NCO) corps is not well developed. NCOs have virtually no autonomy or authority. Emphasis on training and professional development is for officers only. The NCOs account for slightly more than one-third of the total army strength. About half of the NCOs are sergeants, who serve as command links between officers and ranks. Some also serve as middle-level technicians. In the early 1990s, the army began to undergo a generational change. The generals of the early 1990s had been junior officers in the early 1960s and had witnessed the military coup in 1964. Their worldview was shaped and influenced by the <a href="anticommunism">anticommunism</a> of that time. These generals were being replaced by colonels who had entered the army in the early 1970s and whose view of the world had been shaped less by <a href="ideology">ideology</a> and more by <a href="pragmatism">pragmatism</a>. The United States, particularly through its counterinsurgency doctrines of the early 1960s, was more influential with the older group of <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officer</a>s.

The Army General Staff (Estado-Maior do Exército-EME) directs training and operations. The EME has expanded from four sections in 1968 to 15 sections in 1994. It is headed by the EME chief, except in the event of a war. From 1946 through 1985, the army was divided into four numbered armies: the First Army was centered in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, the Second Army in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, the Third Army in <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>, and the Fourth Army in <a href="Recife">Recife</a>. Historically, the First Army was the most politically significant because of Rio de Janeiro's position as the nation's capital through the 1950s. The Third Army was also important because of its shared border with <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> (Brazil's traditional rival in Latin America) and <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>. In 1964, for example, close to two-thirds of the Brazilian troops were in the Third Army, and somewhat fewer than one-third were in the First Army. The rest were sprinkled throughout the Second and Fourth Armies. The Planalto Military Command (Comando Militar do Planalto-CMP), comprising the <a href="Federal%20District%20%28Brazil%29">Federal District</a> and <a href="Goi%C3%A1s">Goiás</a> State, and the <a href="Amazon%20Military%20Command">Amazon Military Command</a> (Comando Militar da Amazônia-CMA) supplemented the four armies.

On January 1, 1986, the army was restructured from four numbered armies and two military commands into seven military commands. The major addition was the Western Military Command (Comando Militar do Oeste-CMO), whose territory encompasses the states of <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a> and <a href="Mato%20Grosso%20do%20Sul">Mato Grosso do Sul</a> (previously under the Second Army territory), and <a href="Rond%C3%B4nia">Rondônia</a> (previously under the CMA). Each of the seven military commands has its <a href="headquarter">headquarter</a>s in a major city: Eastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Leste-CML), Rio de Janeiro; Southeastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Sudeste-CMSE), São Paulo; Southern Military Command (Comando Militar do Sul-CMS), <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>; Northeastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Nordeste-CMN), <a href="Recife">Recife</a>; CMO, <a href="Campo%20Grande">Campo Grande</a>; CMP, Brasília; and CMA, <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>. The CMP and CMO are led by major generals (three-star); the other five are headed by full generals (four-star). The army is divided further into 11 military regions. The CMSE is made up of only one state, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, and is in charge of protecting the industrial base of the country.

The changes were instituted as part of a modernisation campaign to make the army better prepared for rapid mobilisation. The reorganization reflected Brazil's geopolitical drive to "occupy the <a href="frontier">frontier</a>" and the growing importance of Brasília, the Amazon, and western Brazil. In 1997 there were major units around <a href="Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a>, four jungle brigades, and five jungle battalions extending from <a href="Amap%C3%A1">Amapá</a> to <a href="Mato%20Grosso%20do%20Sul">Mato Grosso do Sul</a>. A tour with jungle units is a coveted assignment and is considered career-enhancing. The move to occupy the Amazon and the short-term political implications of the army's reorganisation should not be overstated. The army's geographic organization and distribution have continued to reflect a concern with internal rather than external defense. In what is perhaps an anachronism, the CML in Rio de Janeiro continues to have some of the best troop units and the most modern equipment. Command of the CML is still a coveted assignment, and the Military Village (Vila Militar), Rio de Janeiro's garrison or military community, is still considered one of the most important centers of military influence in the entire country. Principal army schools are located there or nearby. The CML is also important in countering the trafficking of drugs and armaments.

In a significant political development, the army established a formal High Command in 1964. Before that time, a clique of generals residing in Rio de Janeiro controlled major decisions of the army. Throughout the authoritarian period, tensions often existed between the High Command and the five generals who served as president. This tension was such that President <a href="Ernesto%20Geisel">Geisel</a> dismissed Minister of Army Sylvio Frota in 1977. Since the January 1986 restructuring, the High Command has been composed of the seven regional commanders, the chief of staff, and the minister of army. The High Command meets to discuss all issues, including those of a political nature, and is responsible for drawing up the list of generals from which the president chooses those who will be promoted to four stars.

The navy (, ) traces its heritage to Admiral Cochrane's mercenary fleet and to the tiny Portuguese ships and crews that protected the earliest coastal colonies from seaborne marauders. The navy is the most aristocratic and conservative of the services and draws a larger share of its officers from the upper middle class and upper class. Although it is involved in "brown-water" (riverine and coastal) operations, the navy's primary goal has been to become an effective "blue-water" navy, able to project power on the high seas. Given its "blue-water" bias, the navy is even less inclined to become involved in counterdrug operations than the army or air force.

The total naval strength of 64,700 in 1997 included Naval Aviation with 1,300 members, the Marines Corpo de Fuzileiros Navais-CFN with 14,600 members, and only 2,000 conscripts. Naval operations are directed from the Ministry of Navy in Brasília through the Navy General Staff (Estado-Maior da Armada-EMA), six naval districts (five oceanic and one riverine), and two naval commands-Brasília Naval Command (Comando Naval de Brasília-CNB) and Manaus Naval Command (Comando Naval de <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>-CNM).

The 1st Naval District is located at the country's main naval base in Rio de Janeiro; the 2nd Naval District is in <a href="Salvador%2C%20Bahia">Salvador</a>; the 3rd Naval District is located in <a href="Natal%2C%20Rio%20Grande%20do%20Norte">Natal</a>; the 4th Naval District is located in <a href="Bel%C3%A9m">Belém</a>; and the 5th Naval District is located in <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>. The 6th Riverine District has its headquarters in <a href="Lad%C3%A1rio">Ladário</a>, near <a href="Corumb%C3%A1">Corumbá</a> on the <a href="Paraguay%20River">Paraguay River</a>.
Until the 1980s, the flagship of the ocean-going navy was the aircraft carrier "Minas Gerais" (the ex-British HMS "Vengeance"), which has been in service since 1945. Purchased from Britain in 1956, the "Minas Gerais" was reconstructed in the Netherlands in 1960 and refitted extensively in Brazil in the late 1970s, and again in 1993. In 1994 Mário César Flores, a former minister of navy, declared in an interview that the navy would be hard-pressed to defend "Minas Gerais" in a conflict.
While the "Minas Gerais" was not considered likely to be replaced until the next century, it was nonetheless decommissioned in 2001 following the purchase of the French aircraft carrier "Foch". The "Foch" upon entering service with the Brazilian Navy, was renamed the "São Paulo". It operates A-4KU. As of July 2002, the fate of the "Minas Gerais" was still unknown, with China having reportedly made a surprise bid for its purchase.

The navy's priority re-equipment plans for the 1990s included the receipt of new Inhaúma-class corvettes, the construction of Tupi-class submarines, the refurbishing of the Niterói-class frigates, the acquisition of nine new Super Lynx and up to six former <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> Sikorsky SH-3G/H Sea King helicopters, the construction of the conventional SNAC-1 <a href="submarine">submarine</a> <a href="prototype">prototype</a>, and the development of nuclear-propulsion technology. In addition, the navy contracted in late 1994 to acquire four Type 22 British Royal Navy frigates and three River-class minesweepers for delivery in the 1995–97 period.

After years of intense rivalry between the navy and the air force for the control of <a href="naval%20aviation">naval aviation</a>, President Castelo Branco decreed in 1965 that only the air force would be allowed to operate fixed-wing aircraft and that the navy would be responsible for <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s. According to many critics, such an unusual division of labor caused serious command and control problems. The complement of aircraft carried by "Minas Gerais" included at one point six Grumman S-2E antisubmarine planes, in addition to several SH-3D Sea King helicopters and Aérospatiale Super Puma and HB-350 Esquilo helicopters.

In accordance with the <a href="Humberto%20de%20Alencar%20Castelo%20Branco">Castelo Branco</a> compromise, the S-2E aircraft were flown by air force pilots and the helicopters by navy pilots. A crew of the "Minas Gerais" with full air complement consisted of 1,300 officers and enlisted personnel. As of late 2002, the Navy had reportedly become responsible for flying all aircraft with the rivalry having subsided between the two branches of the armed forces.

The Brazilian Air Force (, , also known as "FAB", or ) is the 2º largest air force in America (behind only USA) and has around 70,000 active <a href="personnel">personnel</a>. The FAB is subdivided into four operational commands:

I FAE (I Força Aérea) Advanced fixed and rotary wings instruction; II FAE (II Força Aérea)
Maritime patrol, SAR, helicopters transport roles and Navy support; III FAE (III Força Aérea)
Fighter command, it has all first-line combat assets under its control – fighter, attack and reconnaissance aircraft; IV FAE (IV Força Aérea) – responsible for transport missions.

The Aeronautic Ministry was created on January 20, 1941, and absorbed the former Army and Navy aviation under its command. In 1944 the Brazilian Air Force joined Allied forces in Italy and operated there for about seven months, this was the FAB baptism in a real conflict. In 1999 after a creation of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Brazil%29">Ministry of Defence</a> (MoD), the Aeronautic Ministry changed its designation to Aeronautic Command, but no big changes happened to the air force structure, it kept almost the same organization it had before.

The biggest, and most important, program of the FAB in the last years is the SIPAM (Sistema de Proteção da Amazônia – Amazonian Protection System), the operational part of the SIPAM is known by SIVAM (Sistema de Vigilância da Amazônia – Amazon Vigilance System). The SIVAM is a huge network of radars, sensors and personnel integrated to guard and protect the <a href="Amazon%20Rainforest">Amazon Rainforest</a> and its resources. In 2002 the Embraer R-99A AEW&C equipped with the Ericsson Erieye Airborne Radar and the R-99B SR (Electronic Intelligence Gathering version) entered service. The R-99 fleet is one of the principal components of the system, the aircraft are based at Anápolis AB near Brasília and fly 24 hours a day over the Amazonian region.

The backbone of the Brazilian combat aviation made up of three types, the <a href="Northrop%20F-5">Northrop F-5E/F</a>, the Embraer/Aermacchi <a href="AMX%20International%20AMX">A-1A/B (AMX)</a> and the Embraer A/T-29 <a href="Super%20Tucano">Super Tucano</a>. The F-5s are under a modernisation program called F-5BR program, the aircraft official designation is F-5M. The upgrade is being carried out by Embraer and Elbit; it includes a new avionics suite, a full glass cockpit with three MFDs, HOTAS configuration and a new multimode radar, the Italian Grifo F. The first F-5EM was handed over on September 21, 2005, and it is scheduled at a rate of two aircraft being delivered each month from that date onwards.
The A-1s are the main attack/ bomber aircraft of the FAB. There are three squadrons operating the A-1, one of them equipped with the RA-1 variant having a reconnaissance function as its primary role, but retaining all attack capabilities of the A-1. The RA-1s are equipped with RAFAEL's RecceLite reconnaissance system. Like the F-5, the A-1 is under a MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) program as well, this upgrade giving a high commonality between the avionics of the A-1M (MLU aircraft designation), the F-5M and the newly introduced Embraer A/T-29.

With the Mirage III withdrawn, the air defence of Brasília and region is done temporarily by a mix of F-5s from 1st GAv and 1st/14th GAv until 10 Mirage 2000Cs and two Mirage 2000B bought from <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a> surplus stocks arrive at <a href="An%C3%A1polis">Anápolis</a>. The Mirage 2000s are meant to be in service until at least 2015, when the Brazilian Air Force foresee the (postponed) F-X entering in service.

To replace the Embraer P-95 Bandeirulha in the maritime patrol duties, 12 Lockheed P-3A Orions have been bought from <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> surplus and eight (with an option for a ninth) of them are being upgraded by EADS CASA in Spain, the remainder are to be used as spare parts source. On the same day of contract signature for the P-3BR work, 29 April 2005, EADS CASA was also awarded a contract to supply 12 C-295M medium transport aircraft. Deliveries started in 2006 with the first aircraft arriving in October 2006. The first three C-295s, designated C-105A Amazonas in Brazilian service, were commissioned into service in a formal ceremony at Base Aérea de <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a> on March 31, 2007. The C-105 replaces the FAB's C-115 Buffalo fleet and will supplement the C-130 Hercules.

The main heavy transport aircraft is the Lockheed C-130H Hercules and it will not change soon. The "Herks" are receiving major upgrades, receiving a full glass cockpit besides many other modifications. The first upgraded C-130 entering operational service recently. There are four Boeing KC-137 used as transport and tankers roles. In 2005 FAB received one <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> ACJ, callsign "Air Force One" and dubbed as "Santos Dumont." The ACJ is now the main presidential transport and it is assisted by two <a href="Boeing%20737-200">Boeing 737-200</a> and one AS-332 Super Puma, with the KC-137 still serving as presidential transport in case of necessity. The basic pilot training is concentrated in <a href="Pirassununga">Pirassununga</a> (AFA – Academia da Força Aérea) and uses the Neiva T-25 and the well known Embraer T-27 Tucano for basic instruction. Advanced training is done at Natal AB in the AT-29 Super Tucano, which replaced the Embraer AT-26 Xavante in the conversion training course.

Brazil has the need to patrol its of land borders. Since the 1990s Brazil has been relocating its forces in accordance to this <a href="national%20security">national security</a> requirement.

Between 1992 and 2008, the "1st, 2nd" and "16th Jungle Infantry Brigades", the "3rd Infantry Battalion", the "19th Logistics Battalion", and the "22nd Army Police Platoon" were transferred by the <a href="Brazilian%20Army">Army</a> from the states of <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28state%29">Rio de Janeiro</a> and <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a> to the <a href="Brazilian%20Amazon">Amazon</a> region in accordance with the <a href="Argentina%E2%80%93Brazil%20relations%23Democratization%20%281985%29">friendship policy with Argentina</a>. After those redeployments the number of Army troops in that region rose to 25,000. Also relocated from the state of Rio de Janeiro were the "1st" and "3rd Combat Cars Regiment", now stationed in the city of <a href="Santa%20Maria%2C%20Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Santa Maria</a>, in the state of <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>.

However, despite those efforts, the presence of the Armed Forces on the border regions of the <a href="Brazilian%20Amazon">Brazilian Amazon</a> continues to be sparse and disperse, given the fact that the Army has just 28 border detachments in that area, a total of 1,600 soldiers, or 1 man for every of borders. More redeployments are expected since the states of Rio de Janeiro, <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> and <a href="Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Espírito Santo</a> still concentrate over 49,000 soldiers. In May 2008, the Navy announced new plans to reposition its forces throughout Brazil.

The Brazilian <a href="Amazon%20Rainforest">Amazon</a> sustains about 40% of the world's remaining tropical rainforests and plays vital roles in maintaining biodiversity, regional hydrology and climate, and terrestrial carbon storage. Recent studies suggest that deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon could increase sharply in the future as a result of over US$40 billion in planned investments in highway paving and major new infrastructure projects in the region.

These studies have been challenged by several Brazilian ministries, which assert that recent improvements in <a href="environmental%20law">environmental law</a>s, enforcement and public attitudes have fundamentally reduced the threat posed to forests by such projects.

Among tropical nations, Brazil probably has the world's best monitoring of deforestation activity. Estimates are produced by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) for the entire Brazilian <a href="Legal%20Amazon">Legal Amazon</a> by visually interpreting satellite imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The relevance of the CBERS program does not limit itself only to applications of the satellite-generated images. The program also takes part in the Space Activities National Program (PNAE) which objective is to lead the country toward the autonomy of this technology, vital in a path to <a href="sustainable%20development">sustainable development</a>.

The INPE participation in this complex project accelerates the capability of the country in important space technologies, besides contributing to increase and modernize the national industry in the space sector and the infrastructure (laboratories and centers) dedicated to space projects. There has been participation of the national industry in all satellite subsystems on charge of Brazil.

Foreign relations of Brazil

The <a href="Ministry%20of%20External%20Relations%20%28Brazil%29">Ministry of External Relations</a> is responsible for managing the foreign relations of Brazil. <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> is a significant political and economic power in Latin America and a key player on the world stage. Brazil's <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign policy</a> reflects its role as a <a href="regional%20power">regional power</a> and a potential <a href="world%20power">world power</a> and is designed to help protect the country's <a href="national%20interests">national interests</a>, <a href="national%20security">national security</a>, <a href="ideology">ideological goals</a>, and <a href="prosperity">economic prosperity</a>.

Between World War II and 1990, both <a href="democratic%20government">democratic</a> and <a href="Military%20dictatorship">military</a> governments sought to expand Brazil's influence in the world by pursuing a state-led <a href="industrial%20policy">industrial policy</a> and an independent foreign policy. Brazilian foreign policy has recently aimed to strengthen ties with other South American countries, engage in multilateral diplomacy through the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> and the <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a>, and act at times as a countervailing force to U.S. political and economic influence in Latin America.

Brazil's international relations are based on article 4 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Brazil">Federal Constitution</a>, which establishes <a href="Non-interventionism">non-intervention</a>, <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a>, <a href="Internationalism%20%28politics%29">international cooperation</a> and the <a href="Peacebuilding">peaceful settlement of conflicts</a> as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations. According to the Constitution, the <a href="President%20of%20Brazil">President</a> has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">Congress</a> is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and <a href="Treaty">international treaties</a>, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.

The <a href="Ministry%20of%20External%20Relations%20%28Brazil%29">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, also known as Itamaraty, is the government department responsible for advising the President and conducting Brazil's foreign relations with other countries and international bodies. Itamaraty's scope includes political, commercial, economic, financial, cultural and consular relations, areas in which it performs the classical tasks of diplomacy: represent, inform and negotiate. Foreign policy priorities are established by the President.

Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a <a href="regional%20power">regional power</a> in Latin America, a leader among <a href="Developing%20country">developing countries</a>, and an emerging <a href="world%20power">world power</a>. Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of <a href="multilateralism">multilateralism</a>, peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries. Brazil engages in multilateral <a href="diplomacy">diplomacy</a> through the Organization of American States and the United Nations, and has increased ties with developing countries in Africa and Asia. Brazil is currently commanding a multinational U.N. stabilization force in Haiti, the <a href="MINUSTAH">MINUSTAH</a>. Instead of pursuing unilateral prerogatives, Brazilian foreign policy has tended to emphasize regional integration, first through the <a href="Mercosur">Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosul)</a> and now the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20American%20Nations">Union of South American Nations</a>. Brazil is also committed to cooperation with other Portuguese-speaking nations through joint-collaborations with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world, in several domains which include military cooperation, financial aid, and cultural exchange. This is done in the framework of <a href="CPLP">CPLP</a>, for instance. Lula da Silva recently visited to Africa included State visits to three Portuguese-speaking African nations (<a href="Angola">Angola</a>, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20and%20Pr%C3%ADncipe">São Tomé and Príncipe</a>, and <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>). Finally, Brazil is also strongly committed in the development and restoration of peace in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a>, where it has a very powerful influence.

Brazil's political, business, and military ventures are complemented by the country's <a href="trade%20policy">trade policy</a>. In Brazil, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Relations%20of%20Brazil">Ministry of Foreign Relations</a> continues to dominate trade policy, causing the country's commercial interests to be (at times) subsumed by a larger foreign policy goal, namely, enhancing Brazil's influence in Latin America and the world. For example, while concluding meaningful trade agreements with <a href="developed%20countries">developed countries</a> (such as the United States and the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>) would probably be beneficial to Brazil's long-term economic self-interest, the Brazilian government has instead prioritized its leadership role within Mercosul and expanded trade ties with countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Brazil's <a href="soft%20power">soft power</a> diplomacy involves institutional strategies such as the formation of diplomatic coalitions to constrain the <a href="Power%20%28politics%29">power</a> of the established <a href="great%20power">great power</a>s. In recent years, it has given high priority in establishing political dialogue with other <a href="middle%20power">strategic actors</a> such as India, Russia, China and South Africa through participation in international groupings such as <a href="BASIC%20countries">BASIC</a>, <a href="IBSA%20Dialogue%20Forum">IBSA</a> and <a href="BRICS">BRICS</a>. The BRICS states have been amongst the most powerful drivers of incremental change in world diplomacy and they benefit most from the connected global power shifts.

The Brazilian foreign policy under the <a href="Luiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva">Lula da Silva</a> administration focused on the following directives: to contribute toward the search for greater equilibrium and attenuate <a href="unilateralism">unilateralism</a>; to strengthen <a href="Bilateralism">bilateral</a> and <a href="Multilateralism">multilateral</a> relations in order to increase the country's weight in political and economic negotiations on an international level; to deepen relations so as to benefit from greater economical, financial, technological and cultural interchange; to avoid agreements that could jeopardize development in the long term.

These directives implied precise emphasis on: the search for political coordination with <a href="Newly%20industrialized%20country">emerging</a> and <a href="Developing%20country">developing countries</a>, namely India, South Africa, Russia and China; creation of the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20American%20Nations">Union of South American Nations</a> and its derivative bodies, such as the South American Security Council; strengthening of <a href="Mercosul">Mercosul</a>; projection at the <a href="Doha%20Development%20Round">Doha Round</a> and <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">WTO</a>; maintenance of relations with <a href="developed%20country">developed countries</a>, including the United States; undertaking and narrowing of relations with African countries; campaign for the <a href="reform%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">reform of the United Nations Security Council</a> and for a permanent seat for Brazil; and defense of social objectives allowing for a greater equilibrium between the States and populations.

The foreign policy of the <a href="Dilma%20Rousseff">Rousseff</a> administration sought to deepen Brazil's regional commercial dominance and diplomacy, expand Brazil's presence in Africa, and play a major role in the <a href="G-20%20major%20economies">G20</a> on <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a> and in other multilateral settings.

At the United Nations, Brazil continues to oppose <a href="Economic%20sanctions">sanctions</a> and <a href="Interventionism%20%28politics%29">foreign military intervention</a>, while seeking to garner support for a permanent seat at the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">Security Council</a>. Cooperation with other <a href="Emerging%20Powers">emerging powers</a> remain a top priority in Brazil's global diplomatic strategy. On the recent airstrike resolution supporting <a href="2011%20military%20intervention%20in%20Libya">military action in Libya</a>, Brazil joined fellow <a href="BRICS">BRICS</a> in the Council and <a href="Abstention">abstained</a>. On the draft resolution condemning <a href="2011%20Syrian%20uprising">violence in Syria</a>, Brazil worked with India and South Africa to try to bridge the Western powers' divide with Russia and China.

Over the past decade, Brazil has firmly established itself as a regional power. It has traditionally been a leader in the inter-American community and played an important role in collective security efforts, as well as in economic cooperation in the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>. Brazilian foreign policy supports economic and political integration efforts in order to reinforce long-standing relationships with its neighbors. It is a founding member of the <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a> (OAS) and the <a href="Inter-American%20Treaty%20of%20Reciprocal%20Assistance">Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance</a> (Rio Treaty). It has given high priority to expanding relations with its South American neighbors and strengthening regional bodies such as the <a href="Latin%20American%20Integration%20Association">Latin American Integration Association</a> (ALADI), the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20American%20Nations">Union of South American Nations</a> (UNASUR) and <a href="Mercosur">Mercosur</a>. Although <a href="Regional%20integration">integration</a> is the primary purpose of these organizations, they also serve as forums in which Brazil can exercise its leadership and develop consensus around its positions on regional and global issues. Most scholars agree that by promoting integration through organizations like Mercosur and UNASUR, Brazil has been able to solidify its role as a <a href="regional%20power">regional power</a>. In addition to consolidating its power within South America, Brazil has sought to expand its influence in the broader region by increasing its engagement in the Caribbean and Central America., although some think this is still a fragile, ongoing process, that can be thwarted by secondary regional powers in South America.<a href="https%3A//www.academia.edu/12944490/Unveiling_the_South_American_Balance"></a>

Brazil regularly extends <a href="Export%20credit%20agency">export credits</a> and university <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a>s to its Latin American neighbors. In recent years, the <a href="Brazilian%20Development%20Bank">Brazilian Development Bank</a> (BNDES) has provided US$5 billion worth of loans to countries in the region. Brazil has also increasingly provided Latin American nations with <a href="Aid">financial aid</a> and technical assistance. Between 2005 and 2009, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>, and <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> were the top three recipients of Brazilian assistance, receiving over $50 million annually.

Brazil has a large global network of <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a>s, and maintains <a href="diplomatic%20relations">diplomatic relations</a> with every <a href="United%20Nations%20member%20states">United Nations member state</a>, in addition to <a href="State%20of%20Palestine">Palestine</a> and the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>. As of 2011, Brazil's diplomatic network consisted of 179 overseas posts.

Relations with non-U.N. member states: 

Brazil is a founding member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> and participates in all of its specialized agencies. It has participated in 33 <a href="United%20Nations%20peacekeeping">United Nations peacekeeping missions</a> and contributed with over 27,000 soldiers. Brazil has been a member of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> ten times, most recently 2010-2011. Along with Japan, Brazil has been elected more times to the Security Council than any other U.N. member state.

Brazil is currently seeking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. It is a member of the <a href="G4%20nations">G4</a>, an alliance among Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan for the purpose of supporting each other's bids for permanent seats on the <a href="Security%20Council">Security Council</a>. They propose the Security Council be expanded beyond the current 15 members to include 25 members. The G4 countries argue that a reform would render the body "more representative, legitimate, effective and responsive" to the realities of the international community in the 21st century.


<a href="Overseas%20aid">Overseas aid</a> has become an increasingly important tool for Brazil's foreign policy. Brazil provides <a href="aid">aid</a> through the Brazilian Agency of Cooperation (Abbreviation: ABC; ), in addition to offering scientific, economical, and technical support. More than half of Brazilian aid is provided to Africa, whereas Latin America receives around 20 % of Brazilian aid. The share of aid allocated to the Asian continent is small. Within Africa, more than 80 % of Brazilian aid is received by Portuguese-speaking countries. Brazil concentrates its aid for Portuguese-speaking countries in the education sector, specially in secondary and post-secondary education, but it is more committed to agricultural development in other countries. Estimated to be around $1 billion annually, Brazil is on par with China and India and ahead of many more traditional donor countries. The aid tends to consist of technical aid and expertise, alongside a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to development results. Brazil's aid demonstrates a developing pattern of South-South aid, which has been heralded as a 'global model in waiting'. Some studies have suggested that, by giving aid, Brazil could be trying to get access to mineral and energy resources.

Economy of the British Virgin Islands

The <a href="economic%20system">economy</a> of the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">British Virgin Islands</a> is one of the most prosperous in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. Although tiny in absolute terms, because of the very small population of the British Virgin Islands, in 2010 the Territory had the 19th highest <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP per capita</a> in the world according to the <a href="CIA%20World%20factbook">CIA World factbook</a>. In global terms the size of the Territory's GDP measured in terms of purchasing power is ranked as 215th out of a total of 229 countries. The economy of the Territory is based upon the "twin pillars" of <a href="Offshore%20financial%20centre">financial services</a>, which generates approximately 60% of government revenues, and <a href="tourism">tourism</a>, which generates nearly all of the rest.

Historically the British Virgin Islands has normally produced a Government budget surplus, but during the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a> the Territory began to run at a deficit, which continued after the global recession receded. In 2011 the Territory had its largest ever budget deficit, of US$29 million (approximately 2.6% of GDP). By 2012 public debt had quadrupled from pre-crisis levels to approximately US$113 million (approximately 10.3% of GDP). Nearly 84% of that public debt was attributable to a <a href="Peebles%20Hospital">new public hospital</a> built in <a href="Road%20Town">Road Town</a> between 2003 and 2014. "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" argued that deteriorating economic conditions in the British Virgin Islands were caused "not [by] sagging revenues but public-sector profligacy". By 2014 public debt had been reduced to US$106 million and the annual deficit reduced to US$25 million (including budgeted capital expenditure).

By 2016, the Government had returned to a <a href="primary%20surplus">primary budget surplus</a>, but public debt had increased to approximately US$141 million and debt service accounted for over US$12 million of the primary surplus. However, because of an ongoing aggressive capital investment programme, and budget overruns on key public projects, the Government ran dangerously low on available cash. Cash in the consolidated fund fell below US$7 million (with average monthly expenditure at nearly US$30 million), and Government accrued over US$13 million in due but unpaid invoices.

In 2015, British Virgin Islands has been assessed as the 34th in terms of global financial centres. This was the highest ranking of any <a href="offshore%20financial%20centre">offshore financial centre</a>, and of any Latin American country. The Territory scored strongly in areas such as <a href="taxation%20in%20the%20British%20Virgin%20Islands">local taxation</a>, <a href="rule%20of%20law">rule of law</a>, regulatory environment and quality of law for human resources. It scored less highly on infrastructure, access to capital and access to labour.
The <a href="G-20">G-20</a> considers it a <a href="tax%20haven">tax haven</a> and its banking system is described as 'opaque'.

In 2006, a total of 825,603 people visited the islands (of whom 443,987 were cruise ship passengers), mainly from the United States. The bulk of the tourism income in the British Virgin Islands is generated by the <a href="yacht">yacht</a> <a href="charter">charter</a>ing industry. The Territory has relatively few large <a href="hotel">hotel</a>s compared to other tourism centres in the Caribbean. The British Virgin Islands also entertain <a href="cruise%20ship">cruise ship</a>s, although these generate relatively little revenue. However, cruise ship passengers are an important source of revenue for <a href="Taxicab">taxi</a> drivers, who represent a politically important voice in the Territory.

Between 2007 and 2011, tourist visitors to be the British Virgin Islands declined by approximately 12.4%, largely due to the global recession which particularly affected North America, a key source of visitors for the Territory. However, by November 2013 tourist numbers had begun to recover.

According to the <a href="World%20Travel%20and%20Tourism%20Council">World Travel and Tourism Council</a>:

However, these statistics include travel as well as tourism, and so non-tourist related travel (i.e. travel relating to domestic consumption and other industries and services) are included and inflate the figures.

In the mid-1980s, the government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate an estimated 51.4% of Government revenues.

According to official statistics 447,801 BVI companies were 'active' (i.e. incorporated and not yet struck-off, liquidated or dissolved) as at 30 June 2012. There are no recent official statistics on total numbers of incorporations (including struck, liquidated and dissolved companies) but these are estimated at approximately 950,000. Many of these companies were originally formed under the <a href="International%20Business%20Companies%20Act">International Business Companies Act</a>, 1984, but have now been consolidated into the <a href="BVI%20Business%20Companies%20Act">BVI Business Companies Act</a>, 2004. In 2000, <a href="KPMG">KPMG</a> were commissioned by the British Government to produce a report on the offshore financial industry generally, and the report indicated that nearly 45% of the offshore companies in the world were formed in the British Virgin Islands. The British Virgin Islands is now one of the <a href="Offshore%20financial%20centre%23List%20of%20main%20offshore%20financial%20centres">world's leading offshore financial centres</a>, and boasts one of the highest incomes per capita in the Caribbean.

In addition to basic company incorporations, the British Virgin Islands also forms limited partnerships and trusts (including signature "VISTA" trusts) but these have not proved to be as popular as companies.

On 12 April 2007, the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" reported that the British Virgin Islands was the second largest source of <a href="foreign%20direct%20investment">foreign direct investment</a> in the world (behind <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>) with over US$123,000,000,000. Almost all of these sums are directly attributable to investment through the Territory's <a href="Offshore%20financial%20centre">offshore finance industry</a>.

The British Virgin Islands also promotes a number of regulated financial services products. The most important of these is the formation and regulation of <a href="offshore%20fund">offshore investment funds</a>. The Territory is also the second largest domicile for formation of offshore investment funds (behind the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a>) with 2,422 licensed <a href="Open-end%20fund">open-ended funds</a> as at 30 June 2012 (there is no official statistics for <a href="Closed-end%20fund">closed-ended funds</a> which are not regulated in the British Virgin Islands).

The British Virgin Islands also operates as a domicile for <a href="captive%20insurance">captive insurance</a> services, but a prolonged period of overzealous Government regulation combined with the Government's increasing pressure to hire only locals ("<a href="Belonger%20status">belongers</a>") in the insurance industry decimated the industry. Official reports from the Financial Services Commission reflect as of 30 June 2012 only 161 captives remain registered in the jurisdiction.

Former president of the BVI's <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands%20Financial%20Services%20Commission">Financial Services Commission</a>, <a href="Michael%20Riegels">Michael Riegels</a>, recites the anecdote that the offshore finance industry commenced on an unknown date in the 1970s when a lawyer from a firm in New York telephoned him with a proposal to incorporate a <a href="company">company</a> in the British Virgin Islands to take advantage of a <a href="double%20taxation">double taxation</a> <a href="tax%20treaty">relief treaty</a> with the United States. Within the space of a few years, hundreds of such companies had been incorporated.

This eventually came to the attention of the United States government, who unilaterally revoked the Treaty in 1981.

In 1984, the British Virgin Islands, trying to recapture some of the lost offshore business, enacted a new form of companies legislation, the <a href="International%20Business%20Companies%20Act">International Business Companies Act</a>, under which an <a href="offshore%20company">offshore company</a> which was exempt from local taxes could be formed. The development was only a limited success until 1991, when the United States invaded <a href="Panama">Panama</a> to oust General <a href="Manuel%20Noriega">Manuel Noriega</a>. At the time Panama was one of the largest providers of offshore financial services in the world, but the business fled subsequent the invasion, and the British Virgin Islands was one of the main beneficiaries.

<a href="Livestock">Livestock</a> raising is the most important agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements. Fewer than 0.6% are estimated to work in agriculture. Despite its tiny economic impact, agriculture has its own dedicated Government minister (unlike financial services).

Because of traditionally close links with the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a>, the British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as its currency since 1959.

In 2006, the British Virgin Islands government undertook a <a href="deregulation">deregulation</a> of the telephone industry. Prior to 2006, in common with many other Caribbean countries, <a href="Cable%20%26amp%3B%20Wireless%20%28Caribbean%29">Cable & Wireless (Caribbean)</a> had a statutory <a href="monopoly">monopoly</a> on telephone and other electronic communications services. However, in the 1990s, a local company called CCT Boatphone, which had previously provided radio boatphones to tourists on charter boats, expanded into cellular (mobile) telecommunications for land-based users. Although technically in breach of the statutory monopoly, CCT Boatphone was backed by a powerful collection of local interests known as the BVI Investment Club. Negotiations between Cable & Wireless and CCT Boatphone led to a split of the monopolies, with Cable & Wireless retaining a monopoly over fixed line and internet services, and CCT Boatphone keeping a "de facto" monopoly over cellular telephones.

In 2007 the government abolished the previously existing monopolies under an order made pursuant to the new legislation. The process proved politically fraught, and the government's Minister for Communications and Works, <a href="Alvin%20Christopher">Alvin Christopher</a>, ended up leaving the government and joining the opposition party as a result of the furore. The process was also criticised as cumbersome and slow, the initial deregulation having been announced in 2004, and taking no less than three years to come to fruition through delays in legislation and regulation.

Although there have been no new entrants into the fixed line industry, the government issued three licences under the new regime to cellular telephone service providers. The existing provider, CCT Boatphone, obtained one licence. <a href="LIME%20%28Cable%20%26amp%3B%20Wireless%29">"B"mobile</a>, the cellular arm of Cable & Wireless, obtained a second. The third licence was obtained by BVI Cable TV, a local cable television service. The licence in favour of BVI Cable was controversial, as the Regulator had announced in advance that only three licences in total would be issued, and BVI Cable TV had crumbling cable television infrastructure, and was in no position to office cellular telephone services (and to date, has not offered any cellular telephone services, or anything other than simple cable television). However, "b"mobile's main regional competitor, <a href="Digicel">Digicel</a>, was rejected for a licence. The decision was regarded as highly controversial in the local media.

Digicel then issued court proceedings against the Regulator, arguing that he had acted improperly by imposing an arbitrary limit of three licences (although interestingly no complaint was made about the decision to prefer BVI Cable TV's improbable licence over Digicel). "B"mobile was joined to the suit as an interested party. High Court Judge Rita Joseph-Olivetti found in favour of Digicel and quashed the original decision. Digicel commenced separate proceedings against <a href="Cable%20%26amp%3B%20Wireless%20plc">Cable and Wireless</a> (as "b"mobile's parent company) in the <a href="Courts%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">English courts</a>, claiming that Cable & Wireless has unfairly stifled competition in several Caribbean jurisdictions. During the intervening period, "b"mobile has obtained a virtual stranglehold on the cellular telecommunications market in the British Virgin Islands by a combination of low prices and aggressive advertising, as well as significant investment in infrastructure and technology.

Digicel was finally granted a licence on 17 December 2007 and started operations in the BVI on 28 November 2008.

Economy of Brunei

It is almost totally supported by exports of <a href="crude%20oil">crude oil</a> and natural gas, with revenues from the petroleum sector accounting for over half of GDP.

The government has shown progress in its basic policy of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal social cohesion although it has taken steps to become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Growth in 1999 was estimated at 2.5% due to higher oil prices in the second half.

Brunei is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia, averaging about . It also is the fourth-largest producer of <a href="liquefied%20natural%20gas">liquefied natural gas</a> in the world.

This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Brunei Darussalam at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of <a href="Bruneian%20dollar">Bruneian dollar</a>s.

For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 1.52 Bruneian dollars only. Mean wages were $25.38 per <a href="man-hour">man-hour</a> in 2009.

The government regulates the immigration of foreign labor out of concern it might disrupt Brunei's society. Work permits for foreigners are issued only for short periods and must be continually renewed. Despite these restrictions, foreigners make up a significant portion of the work force. The government reported a total work force of 122,800 in 1999, with an unemployment rate of 5.5%.

Oil and natural gas account for almost all exports. Since only a few products other than petroleum are produced locally, a wide variety of items must be imported. Brunei statistics show Singapore as the largest point of origin of imports, accounting for 25% in 1997. However, this figure includes some transshipments, since most of Brunei's imports transit Singapore. Japan and Malaysia were the second-largest suppliers. As in many other countries, Japanese products dominate local markets for motor vehicles, construction equipment, electronic goods, and household appliances. The United States was the third-largest supplier of imports to Brunei in 1998.

Brunei's substantial foreign reserves are managed by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance. BIA's guiding principle is to increase the real value of Brunei's foreign reserves while pursuing a diverse investment strategy, with holdings in the United States, Japan, western Europe, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.

The Brunei Government actively encourages more foreign investment. New enterprises that meet certain criteria can receive pioneer status, exempting profits from income tax for up to 5 years, depending on the amount of capital invested. The normal corporate income tax rate is 30%. There is no personal income tax or capital gains tax.

One of the government's most important priorities is to encourage the development of Brunei Malays as leaders of industry and commerce. There are no specific restrictions of foreign equity ownership, but local participation, both shared capital and management, is encouraged. Such participation helps when tendering for contracts with the government or Brunei Shell Petroleum.

Companies in Brunei must either be incorporated locally or registered as a branch of a foreign company and must be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Public companies must have a minimum of seven shareholders. Private companies must have a minimum of two but not more than 50 shareholders. At least half of the directors in a company must be residents of Brunei.

The government owns a cattle farm in Australia that supplies most of the country's beef. At , this ranch is larger than Brunei itself. Eggs and chickens are largely produced locally, but most of Brunei's other food needs must be imported. Agriculture and fisheries are among the industrial sectors that the government has selected for highest priority in its efforts to diversify the economy.

<a href="Brunei%20Shell%20Petroleum">Brunei Shell Petroleum</a> (BSP), a joint venture owned in equal shares by the Brunei Government and the <a href="Royal%20Dutch">Royal Dutch</a>/Shell group of companies, is the chief oil and gas production company in Brunei. It also operates the country's only refinery. BSP and four sister companies constitute the largest employer in Brunei after the government. BSP's small refinery has a distillation capacity of . This satisfies domestic demand for most petroleum products.

The French oil company <a href="Elf%20Aquitaine">Elf Aquitaine</a> became active in petroleum exploration in Brunei in the 1980s. Its affiliate Elf Petroleum Asia BV has discovered commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas in three of the four wells drilled since 1987, including a particularly promising discovery announced in early 1990. Recently, <a href="UNOCAL">UNOCAL</a>, partnered with New Zealand's <a href="Fletcher%20Challenge">Fletcher Challenge</a> has been granted concessions for oil exploration. Brunei is preparing to tender concessions for deep water oil and gas exploration.

Brunei's oil production peaked in 1979 at over . Since then it has been deliberately cut back to extend the life of <a href="oil%20reserves">oil reserves</a> and improve recovery rates. Petroleum production is currently averaging some . Japan has traditionally been the main customer for Brunei's oil exports, but its share dropped from 45% of the total in 1982 to 19% in 1998. In contrast, oil exports to South Korea increased from only 8% of the total in 1982 to 29% in 1998. Other major customers include <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> (6%), and the countries of ASEAN (27%). Brunei's oil exports to the United States accounted for 17% of the total exported.

Almost all of Brunei's natural gas is liquefied at <a href="Brunei%20LNG">Brunei Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant</a>, which opened in 1972 and is one of the largest LNG plants in the world. Over 82% of Brunei's LNG produced is sold to Japan under a long-term agreement renewed in 1993. The agreement calls for Brunei to provide over 5 million tons of LNG per year to three Japanese utilities. The Japanese company, Mitsubishi, is a joint venture partner with Shell and the Brunei Government in Brunei LNG, Brunei Coldgas, and Brunei Shell Tankers, which together produce the LNG and supply it to Japan. Since 1995, Brunei has supplied more than 700,000 tons of LNG to the Korea Gas Corporation as well. In 1999, Brunei's natural gas production reached 90 cargoes per day. A small amount of natural gas is used for domestic power generation. Brunei is the fourth-largest exporter of LNG in the Asia-Pacific region behind Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia.

Brunei's proven oil and gas reserves are sufficient until at least 2015, and planned deep sea exploration is expected to find significant new reserves. The government sought in the past decade to diversify the economy with limited success. Oil and gas and government spending still account for most of Brunei's economic activity. Brunei's non-petroleum industries include agriculture, forestry, fishing, and banking.

In 2015, Brunei registered its third year of economic recession, the only ASEAN nation to do so. Declining oil prices and a drop in production due to maintenance and repair work at major oil wells have dented the country’s budget which will see a deficit in the fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17.

In the western part of the country, <a href="Liang%2C%20Belait">Liang</a> is currently experiencing a major development with the establishment of SPARK
, which is a 271 hectare site developed to be a world class <a href="petrochemical">petrochemical</a> hub. The first major investment at SPARK is the USD450 million <a href="Methanol">Methanol</a> plant developed by the Brunei Methanol Company, a joint venture between <a href="Petroleum">Petroleum</a> Brunei and two leading Japanese companies, <a href="Mitsubishi%20Chemical%20Holdings">Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings</a> and <a href="Itochu">Itochu</a>. The plant design will give an output of 2,500t of <a href="methanol">methanol</a> per day (850,000t annually). The plant was officially launched by <a href="Sultan%20of%20Brunei">Sultan of Brunei</a> <a href="Hassanal%20Bolkiah">Hassanal Bolkiah</a> on the 25th of May 2010.

Brunei Darussalam in July 2009 launched its national <a href="halal">halal</a> branding scheme Brunei Halal which allows manufacturers in Brunei and in other countries to use the premium Brunei Halal trademark to help them penetrate lucrative markets in countries with significant numbers of Muslim consumers. The Brunei Halal brand is said to be the first proper attempt to put together a global halal brand that will reap the potential commercial returns of catering to the consumption needs of Muslims worldwide.

As envisioned by the Sultanate, the use of the Brunei Halal brand would signify to Muslim consumers the manufacturers' strict compliance with laws relating to Islamic teachings. Brunei also aims to build confidence in the brand through strategies that will both ensure the halal integrity of the products and unfaltering compliance with set rules governing the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing process, logistics and distribution.

A new company, government-owned Brunei Wafirah Holdings Sdn Bhd, has been established as the owner of the Brunei Halal brand. Wafirah has entered into a joint venture with Brunei Global Islamic Investment and Hong Kong-based logistics firm Kerry FSDA Limited to form Ghanim International Food Corporation Sdn Bhd. Ghanim International manages the use of the Brunei Halal trademark. Producers that want to use the brand are required to first acquire the Brunei halal label (or the certification for compliance with accepted manufacturing and slaughtering practices under Islam) through the Department of Syariah Affairs' Halal Food Control Section. They can then approach Ghanim for their application to use the brand.

This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Brunei Darussalam at market prices <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20100611172746/http%3A//www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm%3FG%3D2001">estimated</a> by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of <a href="Bruneian%20Dollar">Bruneian Dollar</a>s.

In the 1970s, Brunei invested sharply increasing revenues from petroleum exports and maintained government spending at a low and constant rate. Consequently, the government was able to build its foreign reserves and invest them around the world to help provide for future generations. Part of the reserve earnings were reportedly also used to help finance the government's annual budget deficit. Since 1986, however, petroleum revenues have decreased, and government spending has increased. The government has been running a budget deficit since 1988. The disappearance of a revenue surplus has made Brunei's economy more vulnerable to petroleum price fluctuations.

Brunei's gross domestic product (GDP) soared with the petroleum price increases of the 1970s to a peak of $5.7 billion in 1980. It declined slightly in each of the next 5 years, then fell by almost 30% in 1986.

This drop was caused by a combination of sharply lower petroleum prices in world markets and voluntary production cuts in Brunei. The GDP recovered somewhat since 1986, growing by 12% in 1987, 1% in 1988, and 9% in 1989. In recent years, GDP growth was 3.5% in 1996, 4.0% in 1997, 1.0% in 1998, and an estimated 2.5% in 1999. However, the 1999 GDP was still only about $4.5 billion, well below the 1980 peak.

The <a href="Asian%20financial%20crisis">Asian financial crisis</a> in 1997 and 1998, coupled with fluctuations in the price of oil have created uncertainty and instability in <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a>'s economy. In addition, the 1998 collapse of Amedeo Development Corporation, Brunei's largest construction firm whose projects helped fuel the domestic economy, caused the country to slip into a mild recession.

The borders of Bulgaria have a total length of 1,867 km; of them 1,181 km are land boundary and 686 km are formed by rivers. The coastline is 378 km.

The northern border with <a href="Romania">Romania</a> is 609 km. Most of the frontier (470 km) is formed by the river Danube from the mouth of the river <a href="Timok%20%28river%29">Timok</a> in the west to the city of <a href="Silistra">Silistra</a> in the east. The land border from Silistra to Cape Sivriburun at the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> is 139 km long. The Danube, with steep bluffs on the Bulgarian side and a wide area of swamps and marshes on the Romanian side, is crossed by two bridges — <a href="New%20Europe%20Bridge">New Europe Bridge</a> between <a href="Vidin">Vidin</a> and <a href="Calafat">Calafat</a>, and <a href="Danube%20Bridge">Danube Bridge</a> between <a href="Ruse%2C%20Bulgaria">Ruse</a> and <a href="Giurgiu">Giurgiu</a>. There are 48 Bulgarian and 32 Romanian islands along the river Danube; the largest one, <a href="Belene">Belene</a> (41 km), belongs to Bulgaria. The land frontier has three border crossings at Silistra, <a href="Kardam%2C%20Dobrich%20Province">Kardam</a> and <a href="Durankulak">Durankulak</a> at the Black Sea. It is also crossed by a major gas pipeline transporting natural gas from <a href="Russia">Russia</a> to Bulgaria. 

The eastern border (378 km) is maritime and encompasses the <a href="Bulgarian%20Black%20Sea%20Coast">Bulgarian Black Sea Coast</a> from Cape Sivriburun in the north to the mouth of the <a href="Rezovo%20River">Rezovo River</a> in the south.

The <a href="Terrain">relief</a> of Bulgaria is varied. In the relatively small territory of the country there are extensive lowlands, plains, hills, low and high mountains, many valleys and deep gorges. The main characteristic of Bulgaria's topography is four alternating bands of high and low terrain that extend east to west across the country. From north to south, those bands, called <a href="geomorphological">geomorphological</a> regions, are the <a href="Danubian%20Plain%20%28Bulgaria%29">Danubian Plain</a>, the <a href="Balkan%20Mountains">Balkan Mountains</a>, the Transitional region and the <a href="Rila">Rilo</a>-<a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope</a> region. The easternmost sections near the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> are hilly, but they gradually gain height to the west until the westernmost part of the country is entirely high ground.

Table, showing the distribution of the height zones in Bulgaria:

More than two-thirds of the country is plains, plateaus, or hilly land at an altitude less than 600 m. Plains (below 200 m) make up 31% of the land, plateaus and hills (200 to 600 m) 41%, low mountains (600 to 1,000 m) 10%, medium-high mountains (1,000 to 1,500 m) 10%, and high mountains (over 1,500 m) 3%. The average altitude of Bulgaria is 470 m.

The contemporary relief of Bulgaria is a result of continuous <a href="geological">geological</a> evolution. The Bulgarian lands were often submerged by ancient seas and lakes, some land layers rose others sank. <a href="Volcanic%20eruption">Volcanic eruption</a>s were common both on land and in the water basins. All three main groups of rocks, <a href="magmatic%20rocks">magmatic</a>, <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary</a> and <a href="metamorphic%20rocks">metamorphic</a>, are found in the country. The oldest rock formations in Bulgaria date from the <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> period than 500 million years ago. During the <a href="Archean">Archean</a>, <a href="Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> and <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> eras (4.0 billion to 252 million years ago) the magmatic rocks were formed. Throughout most of that period the only land areas were Rila, Pirin and the western Rhodope Mountains. The <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era (252 million to 66 million years ago) saw the beginning of the <a href="Alpine%20orogeny">Alpine orogeny</a> that has formed the mountain ranges of the <a href="Alpide%20belt">Alpide belt</a>, including the Balkan Mountains and <a href="Sredna%20Gora">Sredna Gora</a>. The <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> era (since 66 million years ago) is characterized with active tectonic processes, the definitive formation of the Balkan Mountains, the formation of <a href="graben">graben</a>s and <a href="Horst%20%28geology%29">horsts</a> in Rila, Pirin and Kraishte region.

Examples of <a href="List%20of%20rock%20formations%20in%20Bulgaria">rock formations in Bulgaria</a>:

<a href="Exogeny">Exogenous processes</a> such as <a href="weathering">weathering</a>, <a href="erosion">erosion</a> and <a href="sedimentation">sedimentation</a> have an important impact on modelling the land surface and creating rock formations. The exogenous processes have formed <a href="Stone%20run">stone rivers</a> in Vitosha; <a href="scree">scree</a>s in the Balkan Mountains, Rila and Pirin; <a href="Hoodoo%20%28geology%29">earth pyramids</a> in <a href="Melnik%2C%20Bulgaria">Melnik</a>, <a href="Stob%20%28village%29">Stob</a> and Katina; <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s, mainly along the Danube banks and the northern Black Sea coast; <a href="fluvial%20terrace">fluvial terrace</a>s; <a href="Aeolian%20processes">aeolian forms</a>, such as <a href="dune">dune</a>s; <a href="karst">karst</a> forms, including numerous <a href="cave">cave</a>s, <a href="sinkhole">sinkhole</a>s, <a href="ponor">ponor</a>s, etc.

The <a href="Danubian%20Plain%20%28Bulgaria%29">Danubian Plain</a> encompasses the Moesian plate and extends from the river Timok in the west to the Black Sea in the east and from the river <a href="Danube">Danube</a> in the north to the Balkan Mountains in the south, covering 31,520 km, or almost 1/3 of Bulgaria's total area. Its width varies from 25–30 km in the west to 120 km in the east. The highest point is Tarnov Dyal (502 m) in the <a href="Shumen%20Plateau">Shumen Plateau</a>; the average altitude is 178 m. As a result of the rock weathering processes the relief is uneven with fertile <a href="alluvial%20plain">alluvial plain</a>s along the Danube (Vidinska, Chernopolska, <a href="Zlatia%20%28region%29">Zlatia</a>, Belenska, Pobrezhie, Aidemirska), and hilly terrain in the remaining area, including plateaus in the east. The altitude rises from west to east. The valleys of the rivers <a href="Vit">Vit</a> and <a href="Yantra%20River">Yantra</a> divide the Danubian Plain into three parts — western, central and eastern. The topography of the plain is characterized with hilly heights and plateaus. Most of the heights and all plateaus are situated in the eastern parts. There are 14 <a href="basalt">basalt</a> mounds between <a href="Svishtov">Svishtov</a> and the village of <a href="Dragomirovo%2C%20Veliko%20Tarnovo%20Province">Dragomirovo</a>.

The predominant soil types are <a href="loess">loess</a> in the north, reaching a depth of up to 100 m at the banks of the Danube, and <a href="chernozem">chernozem</a> in the south. The climate is <a href="Temperate%20climate">temperate</a>. The flat relief and the openness of plain to the north facilitate arrival of moist air masses in spring, summer and autumn. In winter the Danubian Plain falls under the influence of the Eastern European anticyclone, which brings cold Arctic air masses. The mean temperature in January is –1 °C and in July is 24 °C, making it the geomorphological region with the highest average annual amplitude in Bulgaria — 25 °C.

The <a href="Balkan%20Mountains">Balkan Mountains</a> range is a geological continuation of the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathian Mountains</a>, forming part of the <a href="Alpide%20belt">Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt</a>. This region is subdivided into two geomorphological units, the Pre-Balkan and the Balkan Mountains, also known in Bulgarian as "Стара Планина" — "Old Mountain". Their average altitude is 370 m and 735 m, respectively. Its total area is 26,720 km, of them the Pre-Balkan spans 15,730 km and the Balkan Mountains — almost 11,000 km. The mountain range stretches from the valley of the river Timor in the west to <a href="Cape%20Emine">Cape Emine</a> at the Black Sea coast in the east, spanning a length of 555 km and width between 20 and 70 km. The Balkan Mountains are divided into western, central and eastern part by the <a href="Zlatitsa%20Pass">Zlatistsa</a> and <a href="Vratnik%20Pass%20%28Bulgaria%29">Vratnik Pass</a>es. The range is highest in its central part, which includes <a href="Botev%20Peak">Botev Peak</a> at 2,376 m; the altitude drops slowly to the east until it reaches the sea. The relief is varied, with many mountain passes, gorges and landforms. The southern slopes are steeper than the northern. For the most part the Balkan Range defines the most important watershed in Bulgaria with rivers draining north to the Danube or south to the river <a href="Maritsa">Maritsa</a> and the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. Several rivers in the east drain directly into the Black Sea. In the west, the river <a href="Iskar%20%28river%29">Iskar</a> forms a <a href="Iskar%20Gorge">97-km long gorge</a> that runs north through the mountains.

The Transitional geomorphological region encompasses the territory between the Balkan Mountains and the Rilo-Rhodope Massif and has complex, mosaic relief composed mainly of medium-high and low mountains, valleys and plains. The altitude decreases from west to east. This region includes the <a href="Sub-Balkan%20valleys">Sub-Balkan valleys</a>; the mountains and valleys of the Kraishte region, such as <a href="Ruy%20Mountain">Ruy Mountain</a>, <a href="Miloslavska%20planina">Miloslavska Planina</a> and <a href="Milevska%20Planina">Milevska Planina</a>; the mountains <a href="Lyulin%20Mountain">Lyulin</a>, <a href="Vitosha">Vitosha</a>, <a href="Sredna%20Gora">Sredna Gora</a>, <a href="Strandzha">Strandzha</a> and <a href="Sakar%20Mountain">Sakar</a>; the <a href="Dervent%20Heights">Dervent Heights</a>; as well as the fertile <a href="Upper%20Thracian%20Plain">Upper Thracian Plain</a>. The highest point is <a href="Cherni%20Vrah">Cherni Vrah</a> in Vitosha at 2,290 m.

The Sub-Balkan valleys includes nine valleys, situated between the Balkan Mountains in the north and Vitosha and Sredna Gora in the south. With an area of 1,186 km and an average altitude, <a href="Sofia%20Valley">Sofia Valley</a> is the largest of the nine and contains the nation's capital, <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>. The <a href="Rose%20Valley%2C%20Bulgaria">Rose Valley</a> encompasses the valleys of <a href="Karlovo">Karlovo</a> and <a href="Kazanlak">Kazanlak</a> and is renowned for its <a href="Rosa%20%C3%97%20damascena">rose-growing industry</a>, which have been thriving there for centuries, producing 85% of the world's <a href="rose%20oil">rose oil</a>. The Kazanlak Valley is also known as the <a href="The%20Valley%20of%20the%20Thracian%20Rulers">Valley of the Thracian Kings</a> due to the extremely high concentration and variety of monuments of the <a href="Thracians">Thracian culture</a>.

Srednogorie region stretches between the Sub-Balkan valleys in the north and the Rilo-Rhodope Massif in the south and from west to east includes the mountains <a href="Zavalska%20Mountain">Zavalska</a>, <a href="Viskyar%20Mountain">Viskyar</a>, Lyulin, Vitosha, <a href="Plana%20Mountain">Plana</a> and Sredna Gora. The largest of these, Sredna Gora, is 280 km and reaches a maximum width of 50 km. Kraishte region covers the western parts of the Transitional geomorphological region and consists of two almost parallel mountain groups, Ruysko–Verilska and Konyavsko–Milevska, as well as numerous valleys.

The Upper Thracian Plain encompasses the middle valley of the river <a href="Maritsa">Maritsa</a> and has a roughly triangular shape, situated between Sredna Gora in the north, the Rhodope Mountains in the south and Sakar Mountain in the east. The lowland is 180 km long and up to 50 km wide, spanning an area of 6,000 km. To the east are located the Burgas Plain, Svetliyski Heights, Manastirski Heights, Dervent Heights, and the low mountains Sakar and Strandzha.

The Rilo-Rhodope geomorphological region covers the south-western regions of Bulgaria and includes the <a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope Mountains</a>, <a href="Rila">Rila</a>, <a href="Pirin">Pirin</a>, <a href="Osogovo">Osogovo</a>, <a href="Vlahina">Vlahina</a>, <a href="Maleshevo">Maleshevo</a>, <a href="Ograzhden%20%28mountain%29">Ograzhden</a> and <a href="Belasica">Belasitsa</a>, as well as the valleys of the rivers <a href="Struma%20%28river%29">Struma</a> and <a href="Nestos%20%28river%29">Mesta</a>. The Rhodopes are the most extensive mountain range in Bulgaria, spanning an area of 14,730 km with an average altitude of 785 m, characterized with gentle and densely forested slopes. Their length from west to east is 249 km and reach width of 100 km. The altitude decreases from west to east.

To the west are located Rila and Pirin, Bulgaria's two highest mountains. Rila includes <a href="Musala">Mount Musala</a>, whose 2,925 m peak is the highest in the <a href="Balkans">Balkan Peninsula</a>, while Pirin's highest peak <a href="Vihren">Vihren</a> at 2,915 m is the third-highest in the Balkans. Both Rila and Pirin have rocky peaks, stony slopes, extensive <a href="Alpine%20tundra">Alpine zone</a> and hundreds <a href="glacial%20lake">glacial lake</a>s. Further west is the Osogovo–Belasitsa mountain group along the border with the Republic of Macedonia, whose highest peak is <a href="Ruen%20%28peak%29">Ruen</a> in Osogovo at 2,251 m.

The <a href="Bulgarian%20Black%20Sea%20Coast">Bulgarian Black Sea coast</a> has a total length of 378 km from <a href="Durankulak">Durankulak</a> in the north to the mouth of the river <a href="Rezovska%20River">Rezovska</a> in the south. The northernmost section between the Bulgarian-Romanian border to <a href="Shabla">Shabla</a> has extensive sandy beaches and several coastal lakes, then the elevation rises as the coast reaches Cape <a href="Kaliakra">Kaliakra</a>, with 70 m high vertical cliffs. Near <a href="Balchik">Balchik</a> and <a href="Kavarna">Kavarna</a> the limestone rocky coast is cut by wooded valleys. The landscape around the coast resorts of <a href="Albena">Albena</a> and <a href="Golden%20Sands">Golden Sands</a> is hilly, with a clearly expressed landslides. Dense forests at the mouth of the river <a href="Batova">Batova</a> mark the beginning of Frangensko plateau. South of <a href="Varna">Varna</a> the coastline is densely wooded, especially at the alluvial longose groves of the <a href="Kamchia%20%28biosphere%20reserve%29">Kamchia Biosphere Reserve</a>. <a href="Cape%20Emine">Cape Emine</a> marks the end of the Balkan Mountain and divides the Bulgarian Black Sea coast in northern and southern parts. The southern section has wide and long beaches, with a number of small bays and headlands. All Bulgarian Black Sea islands are situated in the southern coast: <a href="St.%20Anastasia%20Island">St. Anastasia</a>, <a href="St.%20Cyricus%20Island">St. Cyricus</a>, <a href="St.%20Ivan%20Island">St. Ivan</a>, <a href="St.%20Peter%20Island">St. Peter</a> and <a href="St.%20Thomas%20Island">St. Thomas</a>. Sandy beaches occupy 34% of the Bulgarian coastline. The two most important gulf are the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Varna">Gulf of Varna</a> in the north and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Burgas">Gulf of Burgas</a> in the south, which is the largest in the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.

Considering its relatively small area, Bulgaria has variable and complex climate. The country occupies the southernmost part of the <a href="continental%20climate">continental climatic zone</a>, with small areas in the south falling within the <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climatic zone</a>. The continental zone is predominant, because continental air masses flow easily into the unobstructed <a href="Danubian%20Plain%20%28Bulgaria%29">Danubian Plain</a>. The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfall; the Mediterranean influence increases during the second half of summer and produces hot and dry weather. Bulgaria is subdivided into five climatic zones: continental zone (Danubian Plain, Pre-Balkan and the higher valleys of the Transitional geomorphological region); transitional zone (Upper Thracian Plain, most of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the lower Sub-Balkan valleys); continental-Mediterranean zone (the southernmost areas of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the eastern Rhodope Mountains, Sakar and Strandzha); Black Sea zone along the coastline with an average length of 30–40 km inland; and alpine zone in the mountains above 1000 m altitude (central Balkan Mountains, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha, western Rhodope Mountains, etc.).

Despite the large distance, the most important climate-forming factor is the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> through the atmospheric circulation of the <a href="Icelandic%20Low">Icelandic cyclone</a> and the <a href="Azores%20High">Azores anticyclone</a>, which bring cool and rainy weather in summer and relatively mild weather with abundant snowfall in winter. The influence of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> is strongest in the southern parts of Bulgaria, mainly through the Mediterranean cyclones. Due to its small area, the influence of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> only affects a 30–40 km long strip along the coastline, mainly in summer, when the daily <a href="Sea%20breeze">breeze circulation</a> is most pronounced.

Another important factor is the relief. The Bulgarian mountains and valleys act as barriers or channels for air masses, causing sharp contrasts in weather over relatively short distances. The Balkan Mountains form a barrier which effectively stops the cool air masses coming from the north and the warm masses from the south. The barrier effect of the Balkan Mountains is felt throughout the country: on the average, northern Bulgaria is about one degree cooler and receives about 192 mm more rain than lowlands of southern Bulgaria. The Rilo-Rhodope Massif bars the warm Mediterranean air masses and limits the Mediterranean influence to the southern valleys of the rivers Struma, Mesta, Maritsa and Tundzha, despite the close proximity of the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>.

The mean annual temperature in Bulgaria is 10.6 °C and varies from –2.9 °C at the nation's highest peak Musala to 13.9 °C at the town of <a href="Sandanski">Sandanski</a> in the southern Struma valley. The average temperature in the Danubian Plain is 11.4 °C, in the Upper Thracian Plain — 13.9 °C, in the lower mountains — 8.1 °C and in the higher mountains — 2.4 °C. The highest absolute temperature was measured at the town of <a href="Sadovo">Sadovo</a> in 1916 — 45.2 °C; the lowest absolute temperature was measured at the town of <a href="Tran%2C%20Bulgaria">Tran</a> in 1947 — –38.3 °C. The highest temperature in the lowlands and the hilly regions is in June, while in the higher mountains the warmest month is August. The lowest temperature is measured in January and February, respectively. Many valleys experience regular <a href="Inversion%20%28meteorology%29">temperature inversions</a> and fogs in winter. The country's lowest absolute temperature was measured during an inversion in the Tran valley.

The average <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> in Bulgaria is about 670 mm. It is uneven in terms of seasons and territory. In northern Bulgaria the highest precipitation is in May–June, while in southern Bulgaria it is in winter. The average amount of precipitation also varies in term of altitude — from 450–850 mm in the plains to 850–1200 mm. The lowest mean precipitation is in the eastern part of <a href="Dobrudzha">Dobrudzha</a> and the Burgas Plain (450 mm) and in the area between <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a> and <a href="Pazardzhik">Pazardzhik</a> (500 mm); the highest rainfall falls in the mountains — the <a href="Petrohan%20Pass">Petrohan Pass</a> in the western Balkan Mountains and <a href="Zlatograd">Zlatograd</a> in the Rhodope Mountains. The highest annual rainfall was measured in 1957 in the upper valley of the river <a href="Ogosta">Ogosta</a> in the western Balkan Mountains (2293 mm); the highest daily rainfall was recorded at <a href="Saints%20Constantine%20and%20Helena%2C%20Bulgaria">Saints Constantine and Helena resort</a> (342 mm) near <a href="Varna">Varna</a> in 1951. The total annual amount of the rainfall is 74 billion km; of them 70% evaporate, 20% flow into the rivers and 10% soak into the soil. Most of the country is affected by droughts in June and August. The snow cover lasts from 20–30 days in the lowlands to 9 months in the highest mountains.

Bulgaria has a dense network of about 540 rivers, but with the notable exception of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, most have short length and low water-level. The density is highest in the mountain areas and lowest in Dobrudzha, the Danubian Plain and the Upper Thracian Plain. There are two catchment basins: the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> (57% of the territory and 42% of the rivers) and the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> (43% of the territory and 58% of the rivers) basins.

The <a href="Balkan%20Mountains">Balkan Mountains</a> divide Bulgaria into two nearly equal <a href="Drainage%20system%20%28geomorphology%29">drainage systems</a>. The larger system drains northward to the Black Sea, mainly by way of the Danube. This system includes the entire Danubian Plain and a stretch of land running 48–80 km inland from the coastline in the south. The Danube gets slightly more than 4% of its total volume from its Bulgarian tributaries. As it flows along the northern border, the Danube averages 1.6 to 2.4 km in width. The river's highest water levels usually occur during the May floods; it is frozen over an average of 40 days per year. The longest river located entirely in Bulgarian territory, the <a href="Iskar%20%28river%29">Iskar</a>, with a length of 368 km and a catchment area of 8,640 km, is the only Bulgarian Danubian tributary that does not rise in the Balkan Mountains. Instead, the Iskar has its origin in the Rila Mountains. It passes through Sofia's eastern suburbs and crosses the Balkan Mountains through a spectacular 163 km–long gorge. Other important tributaries of the Danube include the rivers <a href="Lom%20%28river%29">Lom</a>, <a href="Ogosta">Ogosta</a>, <a href="Vit">Vit</a>, <a href="Osam">Osam</a> and <a href="Yantra%20%28river%29">Yantra</a>. The longest river flowing directly to the Black Sea is the <a href="Kamchiya">Kamchiya</a> (254 km), while other rivers include the <a href="Batova">Batova</a>, <a href="Provadiya%20River">Provadiya</a>, <a href="Aheloy%20%28river%29">Aheloy</a>, <a href="Ropotamo">Ropotamo</a>, <a href="Veleka">Veleka</a> and <a href="Rezovo%20River">Rezovo</a>.

The Aegean Sea catchment basin drains the <a href="Thracian%20Plain">Thracian Plain</a> and most of the higher lands to the south and southwest. Several major rivers flow directly to the Aegean Sea. Most of these streams fall swiftly from the mountains and have cut deep, scenic gorges. The 480 km–long <a href="Maritsa">Maritsa</a> (of them 321 km in Bulgaria) and its tributaries drain all of the western <a href="Thracian%20Plain">Thracian Plain</a>, all of <a href="Sredna%20Gora">Sredna Gora</a>, the southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains, and the northern slopes of the eastern Rhodopes. After it leaves Bulgaria, the Maritsa forms most of the Greco-Turkish border. Maritsa's major tributaries are the <a href="Tundzha">Tundzha</a>, <a href="Arda%20%28Maritsa%29">Arda</a>, <a href="Topolnitsa%20River">Topolnitsa</a>, <a href="Vacha%20%28river%29">Vacha</a>, etc. The other Bulgarian rivers flowing directly to the Aegean are the <a href="Struma%20%28river%29">Struma</a> and the <a href="Nestos%20%28river%29">Mesta</a>.

Bulgaria has around 400 natural lakes with a total area of 95 km and volume of 278 million km. The <a href="Liman%20%28landform%29">limans</a> and <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s along the Black Sea coast include from north to south <a href="Durankulak">Lake Durankulak</a>, <a href="Lake%20Shabla">Lake Shabla</a>, <a href="Lake%20Varna">Lake Varna</a>, <a href="Lake%20Beloslav">Lake Beloslav</a>, <a href="Lake%20Pomorie">Lake Pomorie</a>, <a href="Lake%20Atanasovsko">Lake Atanasovsko</a>, <a href="Lake%20Burgas">Lake Burgas</a> and <a href="Lake%20Mandrensko">Lake Mandrensko</a>. Of them, Lake Burgas is the most extensive with 27,6 km and Lake Varna has the largest volume with 165,5 million km. The lakes along the Danube were dried to clear land for agriculture with the notable exception of the <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> <a href="Srebarna%20Nature%20Reserve">Lake Srebarna</a>. There are 170 <a href="glacial%20lake">glacial lake</a>s in Rila and 164 in Pirin. They are an important tourist asset. The most renown lakes include the <a href="Seven%20Rila%20Lakes">Seven Rila Lakes</a>, <a href="Popovo%20Lake">Popovo Lake</a>, <a href="Banderishki%20Lakes">Banderishki Lakes</a>, <a href="Vasilashki%20Lakes">Vasilashki Lakes</a>, <a href="Vlahini%20Lakes">Vlahini Lakes</a>, etc. <a href="Swamp">Swamp</a>s and <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es include <a href="Alepu">Alepu</a>, <a href="Arkutino">Arkutino</a>, <a href="Aldomirovtsi%20marsh">Aldomirovtsi marsh</a>, <a href="Dragoman%20marsh">Dragoman marsh</a>, etc. There are around 2,200 <a href="reservoir">reservoir</a>s with a total volume of c. 7 billion km. The largest ones are <a href="Iskar%20Reservoir">Iskar Reservoir</a>, <a href="Ogosta%20Reservoir">Ogosta Reservoir</a>, <a href="Dospat%20Reservoir">Dospat Reservoir</a>, <a href="Batak%20Reservoir">Batak Reservoir</a>, <a href="Kardzhali%20Reservoir">Kardzhali Reservoir</a>, <a href="Ivaylovgrad%20Reservoir">Ivaylovgrad Reservoir</a>, <a href="Studen%20Kladenets">Studen Kladenets</a>, <a href="Koprinka%20Reservoir">Koprinka Reservoir</a>, <a href="Ticha%20Reservoir">Ticha Reservoir</a>, etc.
Bulgaria is rich in <a href="mineral%20water">mineral water</a>s, with 225 mineral springs and a total discharge of 5000 l/s, mainly in the south-western and central parts of the country along the faults between the mountains. Most of them, 148, are situated in southern Bulgaria, while the other 77 are in the northern part of the country. The springs in the north tend to be with cool water, while those to the south are mainly warm and hot. The hottest spring in Bulgaria and the Balkans is situated in <a href="Sapareva%20Banya">Sapareva Banya</a> and reaches 101.4 °C. The Bulgarian word for spa, "баня", transliterated as "banya", appears in some of the names of more than 50 <a href="spa%20town">spa town</a>s and resorts. They are located in several zones: "Balkan Mountains zone" (<a href="Varshets">Varshets</a>, <a href="Shipkovo">Shipkovo</a>, <a href="Voneshta%20Voda">Voneshta Voda</a>), "Srednogorie zone" (Sofia, <a href="Ovcha%20kupel">Ovcha kupel</a>, <a href="Bankya">Bankya</a>, <a href="Pancharevo">Pancharevo</a>, <a href="Strelcha">Strelcha</a>, <a href="Hisarya%2C%20Bulgaria">Hisarya</a>, <a href="Banya%2C%20Plovdiv%20Province">Banya</a>, <a href="Pavel%20Banya">Pavel Banya</a>), "Maritsa zone" (<a href="Kostenets">Kostenets (town)</a>, <a href="Kostenets%20%28village%29">Kostenets (village)</a>, <a href="Dolna%20Banya">Dolna Banya</a>, <a href="Momin%20Prohod">Momin Prohod</a>), "Rilo-Rhodope zone" (<a href="Devin%2C%20Bulgaria">Devin</a>, <a href="Velingrad">Velingrad</a>, <a href="Banite">Banite</a>, <a href="Beden%2C%20Bulgaria">Beden</a>, <a href="Mihalkovo">Mihalkovo</a>, Sapareva Banya), "Struma zone" (<a href="Kyustendil">Kyustendil</a>, <a href="Sandanski">Sandanski</a>, <a href="Ognyanovo%2C%20Blagoevgrad%20Province">Ognyanovo</a>, <a href="Marikostinovo">Marikostinovo</a>, <a href="Dobrinishte">Dobrinishte</a>).

The <a href="soil">soil</a> cover of Bulgaria is diverse. The soil resources of the country are adequately researched and include 17 <a href="soil%20type">soil type</a>s and 28 sub-types. Of them, six types form 88,7% of the soil cover: cinnamon soils (22,0%); <a href="chernozem">chernozem</a> (20,4%); grey forest soils (17,0%); brown forest soils (14,8%); <a href="Alluvium">alluvial soils</a> (9,0%) and smolnitsi (5,4%).

There are three soil zones. The "Northern forest-steppe zone" covers the Danubian Plain and the Pre-Balkan up to 600–700 m altitude. The Danubian Plain is characterised by the fertile black earth chernozem, that accounts for 54% of the zone's area, while the Pre-Balkan is dominated by grey forest soils (39%), which have good physical characteristics but are low in organic matter and phosphorus. The "Southern xerothermal zone" encompasses Southern Bulgaria up to 700–800 m altitude and includes several specific soil types due to the more diverse topography and climate. The most common soil types are the cinnamon forest soils with acidic (cinnamonic) traces, smolnitsi and yellow-podzolic soils. The "Mountain zone" covers the mountainous regions above 700–800 m altitude and has a zonal soil cover. The brown forest soils are distributed at altitudes of 1000–2000 m, the dark mountain forest soils can be found at 1700–2200 m altitude and the mountain meadow soils — above 1700 m. These soils are typically shallow and prone to erosion and are usually acid to strongly acid.

Bulgaria has substantial land in agriculture and forest. In 2006 <a href="land%20use">land use</a> and <a href="land%20cover">land cover</a> was 5% intensive human use, 52% agriculture including pasture, 31% forest, 11% woodland-shrub, grassland, and non-vegetated, and 1% water. The table to the right above lists the 36 classes of land use and land cover along with the percent of total land, the number of hectares, and the colour for the class in the map above the table. When the map and legend are enlarged to their full size individual polygons of land use and land colour are detectable and the type of land use or cover can be determined by matching the colour to the colour of the class in the legend.

There are approximately 60 types of minerals that are extracted commercially in Bulgaria. The mineral resources are divided into three groups: <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a>s, <a href="metal">metal</a>s and <a href="industrial%20mineral">industrial mineral</a>s.

The fossil fuels include <a href="coal">coal</a>, <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> and <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>. Bulgaria possesses significant reserves of coal estimated at 4,8 billion tons. More than 92% of them, or 4,5 billion tons, is <a href="lignite">lignite</a>, which is the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content but is widely used for electricity generation. With reserves of 2,856 billion tons Maritsa Iztok, situated in the Upper Thracian Plain, is by far the largest coal basin in the country which powers <a href="Maritsa%20Iztok%20Complex">Maritsa Iztok Complex</a>, the largest energy complex in South-Eastern Europe. Other lignite basins include Sofia valley (reserves of 870 million tons), <a href="Elhovo">Elhovo</a> (656 million tons), <a href="Lom%2C%20Bulgaria">Lom</a> (277 million tons), Maritsa Zapad (170 million tons). The reserves of <a href="sub-bituminous%20coal">sub-bituminous coal</a> are 300 million tons, situated mainly near <a href="Bobov%20Dol">Bobov Dol</a>, <a href="Pernik">Pernik</a> and <a href="Burgas">Burgas</a>. The recoverable reserves of <a href="bituminous%20coal">bituminous coal</a> and <a href="anthracite">anthracite</a> are insignificant — only 10 and 2,5 million tons respectively. However, there is a huge basin of bituminous coal in <a href="Southern%20Dobruja">Southern Dobruja</a> with estimated reserves of over 1 billion tons but its large depth (1370–1950 m) is an obstacle for its commercial exploitation. 

<a href="Petroleum">Petroleum</a> and <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> are found in northern Bulgaria and within the Bulgarian <a href="exclusive%20economic%20zone">exclusive economic zone</a> in the Black Sea. Crude oil is extracted in <a href="Dolni%20Dabnik">Dolni Dabnik</a> and <a href="Gigen">Gigen</a> in <a href="Pleven%20Province">Pleven Province</a> and in <a href="Tyulenovo">Tyulenovo</a>, <a href="Dobrich%20Province">Dobrich Province</a>. The proven reserves are 20 million tons but there are prospects for new discovering in the EEZ. Gas fields have been discovered off cape <a href="Kaliakra">Kaliakra</a> (reserves of 3 billion m), <a href="Deventsi">Deventsi</a> (6 billion m), between <a href="Lovech">Lovech</a> and <a href="Etropole">Etropole</a> (est. 22 billion m), as well as near <a href="Devetaki">Devetaki</a> and <a href="Butan%2C%20Bulgaria">Butan</a>. It is estimated that the 14,220 m "Khan Asparukh" Block in the northern section of the Bulgarian EEZ has natural gas reserves of 100 billion m.

Bulgaria has significant reserves of metal ores, especially copper, zinc and lead, situated mainly in the southern half of the country. The two largest <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> mines are located in <a href="Kremikovtsi">Kremikovtsi</a> near Sofia and <a href="Krumovo%2C%20Yambol%20Province">Krumovo, Yambol Province</a> with total reserves of 430 million tons. <a href="Manganese">Manganese</a> ore is extracted near <a href="Obrochishte">Obrochishte</a> in Dobrich Province (reserves of 85 million tons), as well as in the provinces of Sofia and Varna. The reserves of <a href="chromium">chromium</a> are small and are scattered in the Rhodope Mountains. Bulgaria possesses important reserves of <a href="lead">lead</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, of them 60% are situated in the southern reaches of the Rhodope Mountains along the border with Greece at <a href="Madan%2C%20Smolyan%20Province">Madan</a>, <a href="Zlatograd">Zlatograd</a>, <a href="Madzharovo">Madzharovo</a>, <a href="Rudozem">Rudozem</a>, <a href="Laki%2C%20Plovdiv%20Province">Laki</a>, etc. Other mines are located near <a href="Ustrem%20%28village%29">Ustrem</a> and <a href="Gyueshevo">Gyueshevo</a>.

Bulgaria is rich in industrial minerals, with 70 types being mined. There are important reserves of <a href="halite">rock salt</a> near the town of <a href="Provadia">Provadia</a> (4,4 billion tons). <a href="Solnitsata">Solnitsata</a>, an ancient town located nearby is believed by Bulgarian archaeologists to be the oldest in Europe and was the site of a salt production facility approximately six millennia ago. The reserves of <a href="kaolinite">kaolinite</a> are estimated at 70 million tons, situated mainly in north-eastern Bulgaria — <a href="Kaolinovo">Kaolinovo</a>, <a href="Todor%20Ikonomovo">Todor Ikonomovo</a>, <a href="Senovo%2C%20Bulgaria">Senovo</a> and <a href="Vetovo">Vetovo</a>. <a href="Marble">Marble</a> is extracted in the mountainous regions — Pirin, Rhodopes, Strandzha, the western Balkan Mountains. There are important quantities of <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>, <a href="baryte">baryte</a>, <a href="perlite">perlite</a>, <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a>, <a href="granite">granite</a>, etc.

The interaction of complex climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions make Bulgaria one of the most biologically diverse countries of Europe. <a href="Phytogeography">Phytogeographically</a>, Bulgaria straddles the <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>n and <a href="Euxinia">Euxinia</a>n provinces of the <a href="Circumboreal%20Region">Circumboreal region</a> within the <a href="Boreal%20Kingdom">Boreal kingdom</a>. The country falls within six terrestrial <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a>s of the <a href="Palearctic%20ecozone">Palearctic ecozone</a>: <a href="Balkan%20mixed%20forests">Balkan mixed forests</a>, <a href="Rodope%20montane%20mixed%20forests">Rodope montane mixed forests</a>, <a href="Euxine-Colchic%20deciduous%20forests">Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests</a>, <a href="Aegean%20and%20Western%20Turkey%20sclerophyllous%20and%20mixed%20forests">Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests</a>, <a href="Forest%20steppe">East European forest steppe</a> and <a href="Pontic%E2%80%93Caspian%20steppe">Pontic–Caspian steppe</a>. Around 35% of Bulgaria's land area consists of forests, which include some of the oldest trees in the world, such as <a href="Baikushev%27s%20pine">Baikushev's pine</a> and the <a href="Granit%20oak">Granit oak</a>. Bulgaria's flora contains between 3,800 and 4,200 <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a> species of which 170 are <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> and 150 are considered endangered. There more than 6,500 species of <a href="non-vascular%20plant">non-vascular plant</a>s and <a href="Fungus">fungi</a>.

Bulgaria's vertebrate fauna is among the most diverse in Europe. The zoogeograhical regions are three: the Eurosiberian region, encompassing the Danubian Plain and the mountainous regions of the country; the <a href="Irano-Turanian%20Region">Irano-Turanian region</a> encompassing Southern Dobrudzha; and the Mediterranean region that includes the Upper Thracian Plain, the lower Struma valley and the Black Sea coast. Bulgaria is inhabited by around 100 <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20Bulgaria">mammal</a> species, including <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>s, <a href="gray%20wolf">grey wolves</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20lynx">Eurasian lynx</a>es, <a href="golden%20jackal">golden jackal</a>s, <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> and <a href="roe%20deer">roe deer</a> among other. The <a href="List%20of%20birds%20of%20Bulgaria">avian fauna</a> is represented by 426 species of <a href="birds">birds</a>, which is the second highest number in Europe. Important conservation species are the <a href="eastern%20imperial%20eagle">eastern imperial eagle</a>, the <a href="cinereous%20vulture">cinereous vulture</a>, the <a href="great%20white%20pelican">great white pelican</a>, the <a href="Dalmatian%20pelican">Dalmatian pelican</a>, etc. The <a href="List%20of%20reptiles%20of%20Bulgaria">reptiles</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20amphibians%20of%20Bulgaria">amphibians</a> found in Bulgaria are 38 and 20 species respectively. The <a href="fish">ichtyofauna</a> of the country has not been fully researched. As of 2000 there are 207 fish species. There are an estimated 27,000 species of insects and other invertebrates.

Concern about biodiversity conservation remains strong within the country. In 1998 the <a href="Government%20of%20Bulgaria">Government of Bulgaria</a> approved the National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy, which was inspired by the Pan European Strategy for Biological and Landscape Diversity. Bulgaria has some of the largest <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a> areas in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> covering 33.8% of its territory. The national policy for governing and management of the protected areas is implemented by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Environment%20and%20Water%20%28Bulgaria%29">Ministry of Environment and Water</a>. Bulgaria's biodiversity <a href="List%20of%20protected%20areas%20of%20Bulgaria">is conserved</a> in three national parks, 11 nature parks and 54 <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a>s.

Politics of Bulgaria

The politics of Bulgaria take place in a framework of a <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary</a> <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democratic</a> <a href="republic">republic</a>, whereby the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Bulgaria">Prime minister</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>, and of a <a href="multi-party%20system">multi-party system</a>. <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the government. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the <a href="Forms%20of%20government">government</a> and the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Bulgaria">National Assembly</a>. The <a href="Judiciary">Judiciary</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature.

After 1989, after forty-five years of single party system, Bulgaria had an unstable party system, dominated by democratic parties and opposition to socialists - the <a href="Union%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20%28Bulgaria%29">Union of Democratic Forces</a> and several personalistic parties and the post-communist <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a> or its creatures, which emerged for a short period of time in the past decade, personalistic parties could be seen as the governing <a href="Simeon%20Saxe-Coburg-Gotha">Simeon II</a>'s <a href="NDSV">NDSV</a> party and <a href="Boyko%20Borisov">Boyko Borisov</a>'s <a href="GERB">GERB</a> party. Today, the president is Rumen Radev

Bulgaria has generally good <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> records as reported by the US Library of Congress Federal Research Division in 2006, while <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a> listed it as "free" in 2011, giving it scores of 2 for political rights and 2 for civil liberties. However, in 2014, there is some concern that the proposed new Penal Code would limit freedom of the press and assembly, and as a consequence freedom of speech.

After the fall of the communism in 1989, the <a href="Bulgarian%20Communist%20Party">former communist party</a> was restructured and succeeded by the <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a> (BSP), which won the first post-communist elections for the Constitutional Assembly in <a href="Bulgarian%20Constitutional%20Assembly%20election%2C%201990">1990</a> with a small majority. Meanwhile, <a href="Zhelyu%20Zhelev">Zhelyu Zhelev</a>, a communist-era dissident from the new democratic party - <a href="Union%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20%28Bulgaria%29">Union of Democratic Forces</a> (abbreviated in Bulgarian as SDS), was elected President by the Assembly in 1990. In the first years after the change of regime, Bulgarian politics had to (re)establish the foundations of a democratic society in the country after nearly fifty years of de facto totalitarian communism. The so-called period of transition (from a Soviet socialist model to an economic structure focused on development through economic growth) began in the early 1990s. The politics of Bulgaria was aimed at joining the European Union and the NATO fold, as the alliances were recognised to have political agendas similar to the goals of the new Bulgarian democracy.

In contemporary Bulgaria, the government and its leader - the Prime Minister, have more political influence and significance than the President. Thus, the parliamentary elections set the short-term social and political environment in the country since the cabinet (chosen by the Prime Minister and approved by the parliament) decides how the country is governed while the President can only make suggestions and impose vetoes.

In the first parliamentary elections held under the new <a href="constitution%20of%20Bulgaria">constitution of Bulgaria</a>, in <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201991">October 1991</a>, the <a href="Union%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20%28Bulgaria%29">Union of Democratic Forces</a> (SDS) party won a plurality of the seats, having won 110 out of the 240 seats, and created a cabinet alone with the support of the <a href="Movement%20for%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms">Movement for Rights and Freedoms</a> — a liberal party (in Bulgarian abbreviated: DPS) which is widely perceived as a party of the ethnic Turks minority in Bulgaria. Yet, their government collapsed in late 1992, and was succeeded by a technocratic team put forward by the <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a> (BSP), which served until 1994 when it also collapsed. The President dissolved the government and appointed a provisional one to serve until early parliamentary elections could be held in December.

BSP won convincingly these elections in <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201994">December 1994</a> with a majority of 125 seats out of the 240. Due to the severe economic crisis in Bulgaria during their government, BSP's cabinet collapsed and in 1997 a caretaker cabinet was appointed by the President, again, to serve until early parliamentary elections could be held in April 1997.

The <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201997">April 1997</a> elections resulted in a landslide victory for the SDS, winning a majority of 137 seats in parliament, and allowing them to form the <a href="Kostov%20Government">next government</a>. This proved to be the first post-communist government that did not collapse and served its full 4-year term until 2001.

In <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202001">2001</a>, the former monarch of Bulgaria <a href="Simeon%20Saxe-Coburg-Gotha">Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha</a> returned to power, this time as Prime Minister with his <a href="National%20Movement%20Simeon%20II">National Movement Simeon II</a> (in Bulgarian abbreviated: NDSV), having won half (120) of the seats. His party entered a <a href="Sakskoburggotski%20Government">coalition</a> with the DPS and invited two functionaries of the BSP (who sat as independents). In opposition were the two previously governing parties - the Socialist Party and the Union of Democratic Forces. In the four years in opposition the SDS suffered the defection of numerous splinter groups. The ruling party NDSV itself <a href="Sakskoburggotski%20Government%23Changes%20on%20February%2023%2C%202005">ruptured</a> into a pro-right core and a pro-liberal <a href="New%20Time%20%28Bulgarian%20political%20party%29">fringe</a> group. Bulgarian entered <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in 2004.

In the aftermath, the BSP won the parliamentary elections in <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202005">2005</a> with 82 out of the 240 seats, but as it didn't get the majority of the seats, a <a href="Stanishev%20Government">coalition government</a> was formed by the three biggest parties - BSP, NDSV and DPS. The elections also put in parliament some of the right-wing parties, as well as the extreme-right nationalist coalition led by the party <a href="Attack%20%28political%20party%29">Ataka</a> as an answer to the former coalition government of NDSV with DPS. Bulgarian entered the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> in 2007.

In the parliamentary elections of <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202009">2009</a> the centre-right party of the mayor of <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> won <a href="GERB">GERB</a> picking up 117 seats. The party formed a <a href="First%20Borisov%20Government">minority government</a> with the support of the right-wing parties. Once the governing party - the <a href="National%20Movement%20Simeon%20II">National Movement Simeon II</a> did not amass enough votes to enter the parliament. The austerity measures required in the stagnation of the <a href="Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%9308">Global Financial Crisis</a> led to <a href="2013%20Bulgarian%20protests%20against%20the%20Borisov%20cabinet">massive protests</a> and the resignation of the cabinet in early 2013, months before the end of GERB's term.

In the early <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202013">elections</a> the former leading party GERB received highest vote from the people. This was the first time since 1989 that a ruling party was re-elected; in the past painful and unpopular reforms had to be implemented. However, as GERB received only 97 of the 240 seats, and failed to make a coalition, they refused the mandate, handing it down to the next party BSP. The socialist party chose the non-party former Minister of Finance <a href="Plamen%20Oresharski">Plamen Oresharski</a> to form a <a href="Oresharski%20Government">cabinet</a>. His cabinet was supported by the BSP and the DPS, opposed by GERB, while Ataka was absent.

Only two weeks after its initial formation the Oresharski government came under criticism and had to deal with <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bulgarian%20protests%20against%20the%20Oresharski%20cabinet">large-scale protests</a> some with more than 11 000 participants. One of the main reasons for these protests was the controversial appointment of media mogul <a href="Delyan%20Peevski">Delyan Peevski</a> as a chief of the National Security State Agency. The protests continued over the lifetime of the Oresharski government. In all, the government survived 5 <a href="vote%20of%20confidence">votes of no-confidence</a> before voluntarily resigning. Following an agreement from the three largest parties (GERB, BSP and DPS) to hold early parliamentary elections for 5 October 2014, the cabinet agreed to resign by the end of July, with the resignation of the cabinet becoming a fact on 23 July 2014. The next day parliament voted 180-8 (8 abstained and 44 were absent) to accept the government's resignation. Following the vote, President Plevneliev offered the mandate to GERB to try and form government, but it was refused. The next day the BSP returned the mandate as well. On 30 July, the DPS refused the mandate as well. Finally, on 6 August, a <a href="Bliznashki%20Government">caretaker government</a> led by <a href="Georgi%20Bliznashki">Georgi Bliznashki</a> was sworn into office and the Oresharski government was officially dissolved.

As agreed, <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202014">parliamentary elections</a> were held on 5 October 2014 to elect the 43rd <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Assembly</a>. <a href="GERB">GERB</a> remained the largest party, winning 84 of the 240 seats with around a third of the vote. A total of eight parties won seats, the first time since the beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Bulgaria">President</a> <a href="Rosen%20Plevneliev">Rosen Plevneliev</a> to form a government, Borisov's GERB <a href="Second%20Borisov%20Government">formed a coalition</a> with the <a href="Reformist%20Bloc">Reformist Bloc</a>, had a partnership agreement for the support of the <a href="Alternative%20for%20Bulgarian%20Revival">Alternative for Bulgarian Revival</a>, and also had the outside support of the <a href="Patriotic%20Front%20%28Bulgaria%29">Patriotic Front</a>. The cabinet of twenty ministers was approved by a majority of 136-97 (with one abstention). Borisov was then chosen as prime minister by an even larger vote of 149-85. Borisov become the first person to be elected twice as Prime Minister in the <a href="History%20of%20Bulgaria%20since%201989">recent history of Bulgaria</a>. With the support of the coalition partner (the Reformist Bloc) members of the parties in the Bloc (<a href="Democrats%20for%20a%20Strong%20Bulgaria">Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB)</a>, <a href="Union%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20%28Bulgaria%29">Union of Democratic Forces (SDS)</a>, <a href="Bulgaria%20for%20Citizens%20Movement">Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG)</a> and <a href="Bulgarian%20Agrarian%20National%20Union">Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS)</a>) were chosen for Minister positions. The vice chairman of the <a href="Alternative%20for%20Bulgarian%20Revival">Alternative for Bulgarian Revival</a> party <a href="Ivaylo%20Kalfin">Ivaylo Kalfin</a> was voted for Depute Prime Minister and Minister of Labor and Social Policy.

In 1992 Zhelev won Bulgaria's first presidential <a href="Bulgarian%20presidential%20election%2C%201992">elections</a> and served as President until 1997. The <a href="Bulgarian%20presidential%20election%2C%201996">second</a> President was another member of the Union of Democratic Forces - <a href="Petar%20Stoyanov">Petar Stoyanov</a>, who served until 2002. In <a href="Bulgarian%20presidential%20election%2C%202001">2001</a> leader of the <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a> - <a href="Georgi%20Parvanov">Georgi Parvanov</a> defeated Stoyanov and took office in 2002 and served until 2012; becoming the only president to be reelected after his successful <a href="Bulgarian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">2006</a> campaign. In <a href="Bulgarian%20presidential%20election%2C%202011">2011</a> GERB candidate <a href="Rosen%20Plevneliev">Rosen Plevneliev</a> was elected to serve as President from 2012 until January, 2017.

The <a href="president%20of%20Bulgaria">president of Bulgaria</a> is directly elected for a 5-year term with the right to one re-election. The president serves as the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> and commander in chief of the armed forces. The President's main duties are to schedule elections and referendums, represent Bulgaria abroad, conclude international treaties, and head the Consultative Council for National Security. The President may return legislation to the National Assembly for further debate—a kind of veto—but the legislation can be passed again by an absolute majority vote.

The Council of Ministers is the principal organ of the executive branch. It is usually formed by the majority party in Parliament, if one exists, or by the largest party in Parliament along with coalition partners. Chaired by the Prime Minister, it is responsible for carrying out state policy, managing the state budget, and maintaining law and order. The Council must resign if the National Assembly passes a vote of no confidence in the Council or the Prime Minister or rejects a vote of confidence.
The current <a href="Government%20of%20Bulgaria">government</a> is a coalition between the left-wing Bulgarian Socialist Party and the liberal Movement for Rights and Freedoms.

The Bulgarian <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> <a href="parliament">parliament</a>, the National Assembly or <a href="Narodno%20Sabranie">Narodno Sabranie</a>, consists of 240 deputies who are elected for 4-year-terms by popular vote. The votes are for party or coalition lists of candidates for each of the 28 administrative divisions. A party or coalition must garner a minimum of 4% of the vote in order to enter parliament. Parliament is responsible for enactment of laws, approval of the budget, scheduling of presidential elections, selection and dismissal of the <a href="prime%20Minister%20of%20Bulgaria">prime minister</a> and other ministers, declaration of war, deployment of troops outside of Bulgaria, and ratification of international treaties and agreements.

The Bulgarian judicial system consists of regional, district and appeal courts, as well as a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Cassation%20of%20Bulgaria">Supreme Court of Cassation</a> and one Specialized Criminal Court. In addition, there is a <a href="Supreme%20Administrative%20Court%20of%20Bulgaria">Supreme Administrative Court</a> and a system of military courts. The Presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court as well as the <a href="Prosecutor%20General">Prosecutor General</a> are elected by a qualified majority of two-thirds from all the members of the Supreme Judicial Council and are appointed by the President of the Republic. The Supreme Judicial Council is in charge of the self-administration and organisation of the Judiciary.

A qualified majority of two-thirds of the membership of the Supreme Judicial Council elects the Presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and of the Supreme Administrative Court, as well as the Prosecutor General, from among its members; the President of the Republic then appoints those elected.

The Supreme Judicial Council has charge of the self-administration and organization of the Judiciary.

The <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Bulgaria">Constitutional Court of Bulgaria</a> supervises the review of the constitutionality of laws and statutes brought before it, as well as the compliance of these laws with international treaties that the Government has signed. Parliament elects the 12 members of the Constitutional Court by a two-thirds majority. The members serve for a nine-year term.

The territory of the Republic of Bulgaria is divided into provinces and municipalities. In all Bulgaria has 28 provinces, each headed by a provincial governor appointed by the government. In addition, there are 263 municipalities.

Economy of Bulgaria

The economy of Bulgaria functions on the principles of the <a href="free%20market">free market</a>, having a large private sector and a smaller public one. <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> is an industrialised upper-middle-income country according to the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>, and is a member of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU), <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO), <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) and <a href="BSEC">Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation</a> (BSEC). Bulgarian economy has experienced rapid growth reaching estimated <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP) of $152 billion (PPP, 2017 est), GDP per capita of $21,498 (PPP, 2017 est), and average monthly gross salary of 1,060 <a href="Bulgarian%20lev">leva</a> (542 <a href="euro">euro</a>) (April, 2017). The national currency is the <a href="Bulgarian%20lev">lev</a> (plural leva), pegged to the <a href="euro">euro</a> at a rate of 1.95583 leva for 1 euro. The lev is the strongest and most stable currency in Eastern Europe.

The strongest sectors in the economy are <a href="energy">energy</a>, <a href="mining">mining</a>, <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, <a href="machinery">machine building</a>, <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> and <a href="tourism">tourism</a>. Primary industrial exports are clothing, iron and steel, machinery and refined fuels.

The trading partners with largest contribution to the import/export are Germany, Russia, Italy, Turkey, Romania, Greece, France and Spain.

<a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> is the capital and economic heart of Bulgaria and home to most major Bulgarian and international companies operating in the country, as well as the <a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Bank">Bulgarian National Bank</a> and the <a href="Bulgarian%20Stock%20Exchange%20%E2%80%93%20Sofia">Bulgarian Stock Exchange</a>.

<a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a> is the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20cities%20and%20second%20largest%20cities%20by%20country">second-largest city</a> and has one of the largest economies in Bulgaria.

<a href="Varna">Varna</a> is the third largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, economically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities.

The Bulgarian economy has developed significantly in the last 26 years, despite all difficulties after the disband of <a href="Comecon">Comecon</a> in 1991. In the early 1990s, the country's slow pace of privatization, contradictory government tax and investment policies, and bureaucratic red tape kept the <a href="foreign%20direct%20investment">foreign direct investment</a> (FDI) among the lowest in the region. Total <a href="foreign%20direct%20investment">FDI</a> from 1991 through 1996 was $831 million.

In December 1996, Bulgaria joined the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a>. After this, in the years since 1997, however, Bulgaria has begun to attract substantial foreign investment. In 2004 alone, over 2.72 billion euro ($3.47 billion) were invested by foreign companies. In 2005, economists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euro ($2.3 billion) in the <a href="Foreign%20direct%20investment">FDI</a>, which is attributed mainly to the end of the privatization of the major state owned companies.

After joining the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> in 2007, Bulgaria registered a peak in foreign investment of about 6 bln euro.
Low productivity and competitiveness on the European and world markets alike due to inadequate R&D funding, however, still remain a significant obstacle for foreign investment.
Nevertheless, according to the latest Annual report of the Economic Research Institute at the <a href="Bulgarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a>, the average salary in Bulgaria is a quarter (1/4) of the average salary in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, and should be two times higher when the labour productivity is calculated in the formula.

During the <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a>, Bulgaria marked a decline in its economy of 5.5% in 2009, but quickly restored positive growth levels to 0.2% in 2010, in contrast to other <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a> countries. However, the growth continued to be weak in the following years, allowing the pre-crisis level of GDP to be reached in 2014.

The first modern factory in Bulgaria was set up in Sliven in 1836; since then and especially after the 1860s, the economy of Bulgaria as a whole was in a state of upswing, this being particularly felt in the early 20th century and especially in the 1920s. During the 1930s, the Bulgarian economy was described as an economy militarily bound to Germany. In the early 1940s, as Germany began to lose the Second World War, the Bulgarian economy suffered a decline. As a whole, the period between the 1880s and 1945 was marked by strong industrialization (during the 17th and 18th century Bulgaria had a largely undeveloped industry with <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="crafts">crafts</a>, and partly <a href="trade">trade</a> being the only developed industry sectors). During the Socialism era, Bulgarian economy continued to be industrialized, although free market trade substantially decreased, as private market initiatives became state-regulated. Still, the Bulgarian economy made significant overall progress in modernizing <a href="transport%20infrastructure">road infrastructure</a>, airline transportation, as well as developing the tourism sector by building tourist resorts along the Black sea coast and the mountain regions.

From the end of World War II until the widespread change of regime in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> in November 1989, the <a href="Bulgarian%20Communist%20Party">Bulgarian Communist Party</a> (BCP) exerted complete economic, social and political control in Bulgaria. The party's ascent to power in 1944 had marked the beginning of economic change towards <a href="planned%20economy">planned economy</a>. During that time, Bulgaria followed the Soviet model of economic development more closely than any other member of the Eastern Bloc, while becoming one of the first members of <a href="Comecon">Comecon</a>. The new regime shifted the economy type from a predominantly agrarian one towards an <a href="industrial%20economy">industrial economy</a>, while encouraging the relocation of the labour force from the countryside to the cities, thus providing workers for the newly built large-scale industrial complexes. At the same time, the focus of Bulgarian international trade shifted from Central Europe to Eastern Europe and the USSR.

These new policies resulted in impressive initial rates of economic development. Bulgarian economy closely resembled that of the Soviet Union. Soviet-style centralised planning formed by consecutive five-year plan periods had more immediate benefits there compared to the other Eastern European states where it was first applied in the early 1950s. Throughout the postwar period, economic progress was also substantially assisted by a level of internal political stability unseen in other Eastern European countries during the same period. That represented a change on the Bulgarian political scene as political turbulence was common before BCP's ascent to power.

Nonetheless, beginning in the early 1960s, low capital and labour productivity, as well as expensive material inputs, plagued the Bulgarian economy. With disappointing rates of growth came a high degree of economic experimentation. This experimentation took place within the socialist economic framework, although never approaching a market-based economy.

In the late 1980s, continuing poor economic performance intensified economic hardship. By that time, the misdirection and irrationality of BCP economic policies had become quite clear. Bulgaria's economy contracted dramatically after 1987 when Comecon, with which the Bulgarian economy had integrated closely, dissolved. On 10 November 1989, at the November plenum of BCP, <a href="Todor%20Zhivkov">Todor Zhivkov</a> was dismissed from his long-held party leader and head of state positions. The communist regime gave way to democratic elections and government. Unlike the communist parties in most other Eastern European states, the BCP (changing its name to <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a>) retained power by winning the first free national elections in June 1990. That was made possible by changes in party leadership, programme, reduction of its power base and other moves which permitted economic re-orientation toward a market system. This difficult transition combined with political vagueness and unpreparedness of the Bulgarian people for social and economic changes led to dramatically worsening economic conditions during the early 1990s.

Economic performance declined dramatically at the beginning of the 1990s after the disbandment of the <a href="Comecon">Comecon</a> system and the loss of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> and Comecon market, to which the country had been entirely tied. Also, as a result of political unrest with the first attempts to re-establish a democratic political system and free <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> (Bulgaria was a democratic monarchy with free market economy prior to the Socialist era) the <a href="standard%20of%20living">standard of living</a> fell by about 40%, and only started to stabilize significantly after 1998 after the fall of <a href="Jean%20Videnov">Jean Videnov</a>'s socialist government. It regained pre-1989 levels by June 2004.

First signs of recovery showed 1994 when <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> grew by 1.4%. This progress continued with 2.5% rise in 1995. Inflation, which surged to 122% in 1994, fell to normal rates of 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed during Jean Videnov's government. That was due to the <a href="Bulgarian%20Socialist%20Party">Bulgarian Socialist Party</a>'s inability to introduce vital economic reforms and failure to set legislative standards for banking and financial institutions, thus forcing an unstable banking system. All this led to an inflation rate of 311%, and the collapse of the <a href="Bulgarian%20lev">lev</a>. In the spring 1997, the pro-reform <a href="United%20Democratic%20Forces">United Democratic Forces</a> coalition came to power with its ambitious economic reform package. The reforms included introduction of a currency board regime, which was agreed to with the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> and the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>, allowed the economy to stabilize. The 2000s saw a steady pace of growth and budget surpluses, but shaky inflation.

Successful foreign direct investment and successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning that have contributed greatly to the Bulgarian economy, with a historical growth rate average of 6% a year. Corruption in the public administration and a weak judiciary have continued to be long-term problems, with presence of organized crime remaining very high.

Although politicians were giving warranties that the <a href="late-2000s%20recession">late-2000s recession</a> would not hit Bulgaria, the economy suffered a 5.5% GDP decline in that period. Unemployment rose for at least five quarters bringing Bulgaria's worst recession since the early 1980s. Still, economic circumstances were not too severe when compared to the rest of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. Future prospects are tied to the country's increasingly important integration with the European Union member states.

Members of the government promised to move forward on cash and mass <a href="privatization">privatization</a> upon taking office in January 1995 but were slow to act. United Nations sanctions against <a href="Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="Iraq%20sanctions">Iraq</a> (1990–2003), two of the country's most significant trading partners, took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged in 1994 when the GDP grew and inflation fell. The first round of mass privatisation finally began in January 1996, and auctions began toward the end of that year. The second and third rounds were conducted in Spring 1997 under a new government. In July 1998, the UDF-led government and the IMF reached an agreement on a 3-year loan worth about $800 million, which replaced the 14-month stand-by agreement that expired in June 1998. The loan was used to develop financial markets, improve <a href="social%20safety%20net">social safety net</a> programmes, strengthen the tax system, reform agricultural and energy sectors, and further liberalise trade. The <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>, in its 2002 country report, recognised Bulgaria as a functioning market economy, acknowledging the progress made by Prime Minister <a href="Ivan%20Kostov">Ivan Kostov</a>'s government toward market-oriented reforms.

In April 1997, the <a href="Union%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20%28Bulgaria%29">Union of Democratic Forces</a> (SDS) won pre-term parliamentary <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201997">elections</a> and introduced an IMF currency board system which succeeded in stabilizing the economy. The triple digit inflation of 1996 and 1997 has given way to an official <a href="economic%20growth">economic growth</a>, but forecasters predicted accelerated growth over the next several years. The government's structural reform program includes:
Despite reforms, weak control over privatization led many successful state enterprises to bankruptcy. The SDS government also failed to stop the growing negative account balance, which has since then continued to increase, reaching a negative of $12.65 billion in 2008. The <a href="Sakskoburggotski%20Government">government</a> elected in <a href="Bulgarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202001">2001</a> pledged to maintain the fundamental economic policy objectives adopted by its predecessor in 1997, specifically: retaining the Currency Board, implementing sound financial policies, accelerating <a href="privatisation">privatisation</a>, and pursuing structural reforms. Both governments failed to implement sound social policies.

The economy really took off between 2003 and 2008 and growth figures quickly shot up, fluctuating between figures as high as 6.6% (2004) and 5.0% (2003). Even in the last pre-crisis year, 2008, the Bulgarian economy was growing rapidly at 6.0%, despite significantly slowing down in the last quarter.

On 1 January 2007 Bulgaria entered the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>. This led to some immediate international trade liberalization, but there was no shock to the economy. The government ran annual surpluses of above 3%. This fact, together with annual GDP growth of above 5%, has brought the government indebtedness to 22.8% of GDP in 2006 from 67.3% five years earlier. This is to be contrasted with enormous <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20current%20account%20balance">current account deficits</a>. Low <a href="interest%20rate">interest rate</a>s guaranteed availability of funds for investment and consumption. For example, a boom in the <a href="real%20estate%20market">real estate market</a> started around 2003. At the same time annual <a href="inflation">inflation</a> in the economy was variable and during the last five years (2003–2007) has seen a low of 2.3% and high of 7.3%. Most importantly, this poses a threat to the country's accession to the <a href="Eurozone">Eurozone</a>. The <a href="Bulgarian%20government">Bulgarian government</a> originally planned to adopt the <a href="Euro">Euro</a> no sooner than 2015. Although Bulgaria will have to adopt the euro as a condition to membership, plans have since been postponed for better economic times. From a political point of view, there is a trade-off between Bulgaria's economic growth and the stability required for early accession to the <a href="monetary%20union">monetary union</a>. Bulgaria's per-capita <a href="Purchasing%20power%20parity">PPP</a> <a href="GDP">GDP</a> is still only about a half of the <a href="2007%20enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU27</a> average, while the country's <a href="nominal%20GDP">nominal GDP</a> per capita is about 20% of the EU27 average. However, Bulgaria ranks 38th (2015) in the <a href="Ease%20of%20Doing%20Business%20Index">Ease of Doing Business rank list</a>, higher than most other Eastern European states, and 40th (2012) in the <a href="Economic%20Freedom%20of%20the%20World">Economic Freedom of the World</a> index, outperforming Belgium, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Portugal. Bulgaria also has the lowest personal and corporate income tax rates in the EU, as well as the second lowest <a href="public%20debt">public debt</a> of all European Union member states at 16.2% of GDP in 2010.

The country suffered a difficult start to 2009, after gas supplies were cut in the <a href="Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine%20gas%20disputes%23Dispute%20of%202008%E2%80%932009">Russia-Ukraine gas dispute</a>. Industrial output suffered, as well as public services, exposing Bulgaria's overdependence on Russian raw materials.
The <a href="Global%20financial%20crisis%20of%202008%E2%80%932009">global financial crisis</a> started to apply downward pressure on growth and employment in the last quarter of 2008. The real estate market, although not plummeting, ground to a halt and growth is expected to be significantly lower in the short-to-medium run.

During the course of 2009, the grim forecasts for the effects of the global crisis on the Bulgarian economy largely materialized. Although suffering less than the worst-hit countries, Bulgaria recorded its worst economic results since the 1997 meltdown. GDP shrank by around 5% and unemployment jumped. Consumer spending and foreign investment dropped dramatically and depressed growth in 2010 to 0.3%. Unemployment remains consistently high at around 10%.

The government of <a href="Boyko%20Borisov">Boyko Borisov</a> elected in 2009 undertook steps to restore economic growth, while attempting to maintain a strict financial policy. The fiscal discipline set by Finance Minister Djankov proved successful and together with reduced budget spending it placed Bulgarian economy on the stage of steadily though slowly growing in the midst of world crisis. On 1 December 2009, <a href="Standard%20%26amp%3B%20Poor%27s">Standard & Poor's</a> upgraded Bulgaria's investment outlook from "negative" to "stable," which made Bulgaria the only country in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> to receive positive upgrade that year. In January 2010 Moody's followed with an upgrade of its rating perspective from "stable" to "positive."

Bulgaria was expected to join the Eurozone in 2013 but after the rise of some instability in the zone Bulgaria is withholding its positions towards the Euro, combining together positive and realistic attitudes. The Bulgarian lev is anyway bound to the euro. Bulgaria regards becoming a member of the Eurozone at present as too risky. The 2012 Transatlantic Trends poll found that 72 percent of Bulgarians did not approve of the economic policy pursued by the government of the (then) ruling center-right GERB party and Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.

Much of Bulgaria’s communist-era industry was heavy industry, although biochemicals and computers were significant products beginning in the 1980s. Because Bulgarian industry was configured to Soviet markets, the end of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact caused a severe crisis in the 1990s. After showing its first growth since the communist era in 2000, Bulgaria’s industrial sector has grown slowly but steadily in the early 2000s. The performance of individual manufacturing industries has been uneven, however. Food processing and tobacco processing suffered from the loss of Soviet markets and have not maintained standards high enough to compete in Western Europe. Textile processing generally has declined since the mid-1990s, although clothing exports have grown steadily since 2000.

Oil refining survived the shocks of the 1990s because of a continuing export market and the purchase of the Burgas refinery by the Russian oil giant LUKoil. The chemical industry has remained in good overall condition but is subject to fluctuating natural gas prices. Growth in ferrous metallurgy, which is dominated by the Kremikovtsi Metals Combine, has been delayed by a complex privatization process and by obsolete capital equipment. Non-ferrous metallurgy has prospered because the Pirdop copper smelting plant was bought by Union Minière of Belgium and because export markets have been favourable.

The end of the Warsaw Pact alliance and the loss of Third World markets were grave blows to the defence industry. In the early 2000s, the industry’s plan for survival has included upgrading products to satisfy Western markets and doing cooperative manufacturing with Russian companies. The electronics industry, which also was configured in the 1980s to serve Soviet markets, has not been able to compete with Western computer manufacturers. The industry now relies on contract agreements with European firms and attracting foreign investment. The automotive industry has ceased the manufacture of cars, trucks, and buses. Manufacture of forklifts, a speciality in the communist era, also has stopped. In the early 2000s, shipbuilding has prospered at the major Varna and Ruse yards because of foreign ownership (Ruse) and privatization (Varna).

Only in recent years electronics and electric equipment production has regained higher levels. The largest centres include <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a> and the surrounding area, <a href="Botevgrad">Botevgrad</a>, <a href="Stara%20Zagora">Stara Zagora</a>, <a href="Varna">Varna</a>, <a href="Pravets">Pravets</a> and many other cities. <a href="Household%20appliance">Household appliance</a>s, <a href="computer">computer</a>s, <a href="CD">CD</a>s, <a href="telephone">telephone</a>s, <a href="medical%20equipment">medical</a> and scientific equipment are being produced. In 2008 the <a href="electronics">electronics</a> industry shipped more than $260 million in exports, primarily of components, computers and consumer electronics.

Many factories producing transportation equipment still do not operate at full capacity. Plants produce trains (<a href="Burgas">Burgas</a>, <a href="Dryanovo">Dryanovo</a>), trams (<a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>), <a href="tram">trolleys</a> (<a href="Dupnitsa">Dupnitsa</a>), buses (<a href="Botevgrad">Botevgrad</a>), trucks (<a href="Shumen">Shumen</a>), <a href="motor%20truck">motor truck</a>s (Plovdiv, <a href="Lom%2C%20Bulgaria">Lom</a>, Sofia, Lovech). Lovech has an automotive assembly plant. <a href="Rousse">Rousse</a> serves as the main centre for agricultural machinery. Bulgarian arms production mainly operates in central Bulgaria (<a href="Kazanlak">Kazanlak</a>, <a href="Sopot">Sopot</a>, <a href="Karlovo">Karlovo</a>).

Construction output fell dramatically in the 1990s as industrial and housing construction declined, but a recovery began in the early 2000s. The sector, now dominated by private firms, has resumed the foreign building programs that led to prosperity in the communist era. The Glavbolgostroy firm has major building projects in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine as well as domestic contracts.

Bulgaria relies on imported oil and natural gas (most of which comes from Russia), together with domestic generation of electricity from coal-powered and hydro plants, and the Kozloduy nuclear plant. The economy remains energy-intensive because conservation practices have developed slowly. The country is a major regional electricity producer. Bulgaria produced 38.07 billion kWh of electricity in 2006
(in comparison, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, which has a population nearly three times larger than Bulgaria, produced 51.7 billion kW·h in the same year). The domestic power-generating industry, which was privatized in 2004 by sales to interests from Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States, suffers from obsolete equipment and a weak oversight agency. To solve the latter problem, in 2008 the government set up a state-owned energy holding-company (<a href="Bulgarian%20Energy%20Holding%20EAD">Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD</a>), composed of gas company <a href="Bulgargaz">Bulgargaz</a>, <a href="Bulgartransgaz">Bulgartransgaz</a>, power company <a href="NEK%20EAD">NEK EAD</a>, Electricity System Operator EAD, <a href="Kozloduy%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">Kozloduy nuclear power station</a>, <a href="Maritsa%20Iztok%20Complex">Maritza-Iztok II thermal power station</a>, the Mini Maritza Iztok (Maritza Iztok mines), and Bulgartel EAD. The state holds a 100% stake in the holding company. Most of Bulgaria’s conventional power stations will require large-scale modernization in the near future. Bulgaria has some 64 small hydroelectric plants, which together produce 19 percent of the country’s power output.

The Kozloduy nuclear plant, which in 2005 supplied more than 40 percent of Bulgaria’s electric power, will play a diminishing role because two of its remaining four reactors (two were closed in 2002) must be closed by 2007 to comply with European Union (EU) standards. Kozloduy, which exported 14 percent of its output in 2006, was expected to cease all exportation in 2007. Construction of the long-delayed Belene nuclear plant resumed in 2006 but will not be complete until at least 2011. Belene, planned in the 1980s but then rejected, was revived by the safety controversy at Kozloduy.

Oil exploration is ongoing offshore in the Black Sea (the Shabla block) and on the Romanian border, but Bulgaria’s chief oil income is likely to come as a transfer point on east-west and north-south transit lines. Burgas is Bulgaria’s main oil port on the Black Sea. Bulgaria’s largest oil refinery, Neftochim, was purchased by Russian oil giant LUKoil in 1999 and underwent modernization in 2005. Bulgaria’s only significant coal resource is low-quality lignite, mainly from the state-owned Maritsa-Iztok and Bobov Dol complexes and used in local thermoelectric power stations.

<a href="Thermal%20power%20station">Thermal power station</a>s (TPPs) provide a significant amount of energy, with most of the capacity concentrated in the <a href="Maritsa%20Iztok%20Complex">Maritsa Iztok Complex</a>. The largest TPPs include:

A $1.4 bln. project for the construction of an additional block for the <a href="Maritsa%20Iztok%20Complex">Maritza Iztok 1</a> Thermal Power Station is expected to be completed by the middle of 2010.

Bulgaria ranks as a minor oil producer (97th in the world) with a total production of 3,520 bbl/day.
Prospectors discovered Bulgaria's first <a href="oil%20field">oil field</a> near <a href="Tyulenovo">Tyulenovo</a> in 1951. <a href="Proved%20reserves">Proved reserves</a> amount to .

Although the contribution of services to gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled in the post-communist era, a substantial share of that growth has been in government services, and the qualitative level of services varies greatly. The Bulgarian banking system, which was weak in the first post-communist years, was fully reformed in the late 1990s, including stronger oversight from the National Bank of Bulgaria and gradual privatisation. In 2003 the banking system was fully privatised, and substantial consolidation began making the system more efficient in 2004. Several smaller banks grew substantially between 2004 and 2006. These processes increased public confidence in the banks. Although the system still requires consolidation, loan activity to individuals and businesses increased in the early 2000s. The insurance industry has grown rapidly since a market reform in 1997, with the help of foreign firms. An example is the Bulgarian Insurance Group (BIG), a pension-fund and insurance management company owned by the Dutch-Israeli TBI Holding Company and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The introduction of health and pension insurance plans has expanded the private insurance industry. A series of reform laws in the early 2000s enabled the Bulgarian Stock Exchange to begin regular operation. As of 2005, stock market activity was limited by lack of transparency, although the growth rate increased beginning in 2004.

After a decline in the 1990s, in the 21st century the tourism industry has grown rapidly. In 2016 some 10 million foreigners visited Bulgaria, up from 4 million in 2004 and 2.3 million in 2000. This trend is based on a number of attractive destinations, low costs, and restoration of facilities. Most of the industry had been privatised by 2004. Infrastructure items such as recreation facilities and booking services require improvement. Development of Bulgaria’s retail sales sector was slow until the early 2000s, when a large number of Western-style outlets began to appear, and Sofia developed as a retail center. By 2006, several major European retail chains had opened stores, and others planned to enter the Bulgarian market.

Bulgaria has attracted considerable investment from foreigners buying property either for their own use or for investment. In 2006, more than 29% of property deals were signed by foreigners, more than half of whom were UK citizens. Various companies, such as <a href="Bulgarian%20Dreams">Bulgarian Dreams</a>, actively marketed Bulgarian properties to buyers overseas.

In 2007 Bulgaria was visited by 5,200,000 tourists, ranking 39th in the world. Tourists from Greece, Romania and Germany account for 40% of visitors. Significant numbers of <a href="British%20people">British</a> (+300,000), <a href="Russians">Russian</a> (+200,000), <a href="Serbs">Serbian</a> (+150,000), <a href="Poles">Polish</a> (+130,000) and <a href="Danes">Danish</a> (+100,000) tourists also visit Bulgaria. Most of them are attracted by the varying and beautiful landscapes, well-preserved historical and cultural heritage, and the tranquility of rural and mountain areas.

Main destinations include the capital <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, coastal resorts Sunny Beach, <a href="Albena">Albena</a>, <a href="Sozopol">Sozopol</a>, <a href="Sveti%20Vlas">Sveti Vlas</a>; winter resorts <a href="Bansko">Bansko</a>, <a href="Pamporovo">Pamporovo</a>, <a href="Chepelare">Chepelare</a> and <a href="Borovetz">Borovetz</a>. <a href="Arbanasi%2C%20Bulgaria">Arbanasi</a> and <a href="Bozhentsi">Bozhentsi</a> are rural tourist destinations with well-preserved ethnographic traditions. Other popular attractions are the 10th century <a href="Rila%20Monastery">Rila Monastery</a> and the 19th century <a href="Euxinograd">Euxinograd</a> <a href="ch%C3%A2teau">château</a>.

In the communist era, Bulgaria’s agriculture was heavily centralized, integrated with agriculture-related industries, and state-run. In the postcommunist era, the process of restoring agricultural land to private owners in a form that ensures productivity has been slow. Bank investment and insecurity in the land market contributed to slow development in the 1990s. By 2004 some 98 percent of the workforce and output of Bulgaria’s agricultural sector was private, including a number of large private cooperative enterprises. A significant amount of food also is produced for direct consumption by non-farmers on small plots, which are an important support for parts of the population. In 2000 and 2003, droughts limited agricultural production, and floods had the same effect in 2005. Bulgaria’s main field crops are wheat, corn, and barley. The main industrial crops are sugar beets, sunflowers, and tobacco. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers are the most important vegetable exports. Production of apples and grapes, Bulgaria’s largest fruit products, has decreased since the communist era, but the export of wine has increased significantly. The most important types of livestock are cattle, sheep, poultry, pigs, and buffaloes, and the main dairy products are yogurt, cow and sheep cheese. Bulgaria is the world's 13th largest <a href="sheep%20milk">sheep milk</a> producer and is the 15th largest producer of <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> and 13th largest producer of <a href="raspberry">raspberries</a> in Europe. Specialized equipment amounts to some 25,000 <a href="tractor">tractor</a>s and 5,500 <a href="combine%20harvester">combine harvester</a>s, with a fleet of light aircraft.
In 2004 an estimated one-third of Bulgaria’s land mass was covered by forests, of which about 40 percent was conifers. Between 1980 and 2000, the forested area increased by 4.6 percent. In 2002 a total of 4,800 tons of timber was harvested, 44 percent of which was fuel wood and 20 percent, pulpwood. Although nominal state timber standards are very strict, in 2004 an estimated 45 percent of Bulgaria’s timber harvest was logged illegally because of corruption in the forest service. Some 7.5 percent of forests are protected from all uses, and 65 percent are designated for ecological and commercial use. In 2005 about 70 percent of the total forest resource was rated economically viable.

Since Bulgaria stopped high-seas fishing in 1995, the country has imported increasing amounts of fish. The fish farming industry (particularly sturgeon) has expanded in the early 2000s, and some environmental improvements in the Black Sea and the Danube River, the principal sources of fish, may increase the take in future years. However, the catch from those sources has decreased sharply in recent decades, yielding only a few species of fish for domestic markets in 2004. Between 1999 and 2001, Bulgaria’s total fish harvest, wild and cultivated, dropped from 18,600 tons to 8,100 tons, but in 2003 the harvest had recovered to 16,500 tons.

Production of the most important crops (according to the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a>) in 2006 (in '000 tons) amounted to: <a href="wheat">wheat</a> 3301.9; <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a> 1196.6; <a href="maize">maize</a> 1587.8; <a href="grape">grape</a>s 266.2; <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> 42.0; <a href="tomato">tomato</a>es 213.0; <a href="barley">barley</a> 546.3; <a href="potato">potato</a>es 386.1; <a href="Capsicum">peppers</a> 156.7; <a href="cucumber">cucumber</a>s 61.5; <a href="Cherry">cherries</a> 18.2; <a href="watermelon">watermelon</a>s 136.0; <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a> 72.7; <a href="apple">apple</a>s 26.1; <a href="plum">plum</a>s 18.0; <a href="Strawberry">strawberries</a> 8.8.

Bulgaria’s mining industry has declined in the post-communist era. Many deposits have remained underdeveloped because of a lack of modern equipment and low funding. Mining has contributed less than 2 percent of GDP and engaged less than 3 percent of the workforce in the early 2000s. Bulgaria has the following estimated deposits of metallic minerals: 207 million tons of iron ore, 127 million tons of manganese ore, 936 million tons of copper ore, 238 million tons of chromium ore, and 150 million tons of gold ore. Several of Bulgaria’s minerals are extracted commercially; 80 percent of mining is done by open-pit excavation. Iron extraction at Kremikovtsi and elsewhere is not sufficient to support the domestic steel industry, but copper, lead, and zinc deposits fully supply the nonferrous metallurgy industries. A British firm has exploratory gold mines at Dikanyite and Gornoseltsi, and a domestic copper and gold mine operates at Chelopech. About 50 nonmetallic minerals are present in significant amounts. Substantial amounts of uranium are present in the Rhodope Mountains, but no extraction has occurred in the last 10 years.

Despite the poor performance of the mining sector, productivity has increased in recent years. Mining remains one of the most important sources of export earnings and is still a significant contributor to economic growth. The mining industry is worth $760 mln, and, along with related industries, employs 120,000 people. The rising global prices of <a href="gold">gold</a>, lead and copper in 2010, as well as investments in <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and coal production, have boosted economic growth in the mining sector after the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a>. As of 2010 Bulgaria ranks as the 19th largest <a href="coal">coal</a> producer in the world, 9th largest <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a> producer, 19th largest <a href="copper">copper</a> producer, and the 26th largest <a href="zinc">zinc</a> producer. In Europe, the country ranks fourth in gold production and sixth in coal production.

The "Elatsite" copper mine and reprocessing facility, built during <a href="Vulko%20Chervenkov">Vulko Chervenkov</a>'s rule, takes its place as one of the largest in South-Eastern Europe. It extracts 13 million tonnes of ore annually, producing about 42,000 tonnes of <a href="copper">copper</a>, 1.6 tonnes of <a href="gold">gold</a> and 5.5 tonnes of <a href="silver">silver</a>.

Ferrous <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a> has major importance. Much of the production of <a href="steel">steel</a> and <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a> takes place in <a href="Kremikovtsi">Kremikovtsi</a> and <a href="Stomana">Stomana</a> steel in <a href="Pernik">Pernik</a>, with a third metallurgical base in <a href="Debelt">Debelt</a>. In production of steel and steel products per capita the country heads the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. the fate of Kremikovtsi steel factories has come under debate because of serious pollution in the capital, Sofia.

The largest refineries for <a href="lead">lead</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a> operate in <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>, <a href="Kardzhali">Kardzhali</a> and <a href="Novi%20Iskar">Novi Iskar</a>; for <a href="copper">copper</a> in <a href="Pirdop">Pirdop</a> and <a href="Eliseina">Eliseina</a> (now defunct); for <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> in <a href="Shumen">Shumen</a>. In production of many metals "per capita", such as zinc and iron, Bulgaria ranks first in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>.

Bulgaria's national road network has a total length of , of which are paved, but nearly half of them fall into the lowest international rating for paved roads. The <a href="Highways%20in%20Bulgaria">motorways in Bulgaria</a>, such as <a href="Trakia%20motorway">Trakia</a>, <a href="Hemus%20motorway">Hemus</a>, <a href="Struma%20motorway">Struma</a> and <a href="Maritsa%20motorway">Maritsa</a>, are being improved and elongated to a total length of as of November 2015. Railroads are a major mode of freight transportation, although highways carry a progressively larger share of freight. Bulgaria also has of railway track and plans to construct a <a href="high-speed%20rail">high-speed rail</a>way by 2017, at a cost of €3 bln. Sofia and Plovdiv are major air travel hubs, while Varna and Burgas are the principal maritime trade ports.

Bulgaria has an extensive, but antiquated telecommunications network which requires substantial modernization. <a href="Telephone">Telephone</a> service is available in most villages, and a central digital trunk line connects most regions. Currently there are three active mobile phone operators - <a href="Mobiltel">Mtel</a>, <a href="Telenor%20%28Bulgaria%29">Telenor</a> and <a href="Vivacom">Vivacom</a>. Since 2000, a rapid increase in the number of Internet users has occurred – from 430,000 they grew to 1,545,100 in 2004, and 3.4 million (48% penetration rate) in 2010. Bulgaria has the fastest average Broadband Internet speed in the world after Romania and South Korea.

In 2010, Bulgaria spent 0.25% of its GDP on scientific research, which represents one of the lowest scientific budgets in Europe.
Chronic underinvestment in the sector since 1990 forced many scientific professionals to leave the country. As a result, Bulgaria's economy scores low in terms of innovation, competitiveness and high added value exports. Nevertheless, Bulgaria ranked 8th in the world in 2002 by total number of <a href="Information%20and%20communication%20technologies">ICT</a> specialists, outperforming countries with far larger populations, and it operates the only supercomputer in the Balkan region, an IBM <a href="Blue%20Gene">Blue Gene</a>/P, which entered service in September 2008.

The <a href="Bulgarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a> (BAS) is the leading scientific institution in the country and employs most of Bulgaria's researchers in its numerous branches. The principal areas of research and development are energy, <a href="nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a> and medicine. 
With <a href="major%20general">major-general</a> <a href="Georgi%20Ivanov">Georgi Ivanov</a> flying on <a href="Soyuz%2033">Soyuz 33</a> in 1979, Bulgaria became the 6th country in the world to have an astronaut in space. Bulgaria has deployed its own experiments on various missions, such as the <a href="RADOM-7">RADOM-7</a> dosimeters on the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> and <a href="Chandrayaan-1">Chandrayaan-1</a> and the space <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a> (a Bulgarian invention) on the <a href="Mir%20space%20station">Mir space station</a>. In 2011 the government announced plans to reboot the space program by producing a new microsatellite and joining the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a>.

From June 2017, Bulgaria will have its first <a href="Geostationary%20orbit">geostationary</a> <a href="communications%20satellite">communications satellite</a>. <a href="BulgariaSat-1">BulgariaSat-1</a> is a geostationary communications satellite operated by <a href="Bulgaria%20Sat">Bulgaria Sat</a> and manufactured by <a href="SSL%20%28company%29">SSL</a>, based on the space-proven <a href="SSL%201300">SSL 1300</a> satellite platform.
BulgariaSat-1 is the first in the history of the country geostationary communications satellite at the Bulgarian orbital position and it is designed to provide Direct-to-Home (DTH) television service and data communications services to the Balkans and other European regions.
In this way, Bulgaria will be among other European countries with their satellites, namely Belarus, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

Due to its large-scale computing technology exports to <a href="COMECON">COMECON</a> states, in the 1980s Bulgaria became known as the <a href="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>.

In 2005 the labour force was estimated at 3.3 million; in 2004, 11 percent worked in agriculture, 33 percent in industry, and 56 percent in services. The unemployment rate has been in double digits throughout the post-communist era, reaching a high point of 19 percent in 2000. Since then, the rate has decreased substantially with the creation of new jobs in private and state enterprises. In 2005 the official figure was 11.5 percent, compared with 16.9 percent at the end of 2002. However, in 2003 an estimated 500,000 Bulgarians were unemployed but not officially counted because they were not seeking work. In January 2005, the government raised the minimum wage by 25 percent, to US$90 per month. The largest labour unions are Podkrepa (Support) and the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. They represent labour in the National Council for Tripartite Partnership, in which they join government and business representatives to discuss issues of labour, social security, and living standards. The unions were an important political force in the fall of the Zhivkov regime. In late autumn of 2016 reported an unemployment rate of 7%. In 2016, the government increased the minimum wage to 215 euros per month. At the end of 2016 the average monthly salary is about 480 euros a month, but there are differences in the regions of the country.
The average monthly gross salary has reached the value of 1,036 leva (530 euro) in March, 2017. According to the latest Annual report of the Institute of Economic Studies at the <a href="Bulgarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a>, the average salary in Bulgaria is only a quarter (1/4) of the average salary in the EU, and should be two times higher when the labour productivity is calculated in the formula.

Bulgaria’s unit of currency is the <a href="Bulgarian%20lev">lev</a> (pl., leva). In October 2006, the U.S. dollar was worth 1.57 leva. In 1999 the value of the lev was <a href="Currency%20board">pegged</a> to that of the German <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">Deutschmark</a>, which was replaced by the <a href="euro">euro</a> in 2001. Following the <a href="2007%20enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Bulgaria’s admission to the EU</a>, the lev is scheduled to be replaced by the euro.

In 2003 Bulgaria’s inflation rate was estimated at between 2.3 and 3 percent. The rate was 6 percent in 2004 and 5 percent in 2005. In 2015 and 2016 it was recorded minimum level of deflation.

As of 1 January 2008 the <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> for all citizens is set to a flat rate of 10%. This <a href="flat%20tax">flat tax</a> is one of the lowest income rates in the world and the lowest income rate in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>. The reform was done in pursue for higher GDP growth and greater tax collection rates. Some called it a "revolution" in taxation, but the changes were met with mild discussions and some protests by affected working classes. The proposal was modified to allow for compensating the perceived losers from the changes in the tax formula. The <a href="corporate%20income%20tax">corporate income tax</a> is also 10% as of 1 January 2007 which is also among the lowest in Europe. Currently this taxation is kept while other countries raised their taxes during the crisis. However, most of the state revenues come from <a href="Value-added%20tax">VAT</a> and <a href="excise">excise</a>s, but share of income and corporate taxes in the revenues is increasing.

For 2005 Bulgaria’s estimated state revenues totaled US$11.2 billion, and its estimated state expenditures, including capital expenditures, were US$10.9 billion, yielding a surplus of US$300 million. In 2004 revenues totaled US$10.1 billion and expenditures US$9.7 billion, for a surplus of US$400 million.

After the political changes, in 1991, Bulgaria had a US$11.25 billion state debt, which represented 180% of the GDP. The state debt peaked in 1994, when it reached US$14.4 billion. During 1998-2008 Bulgaria maintained policy of <a href="Government%20budget%20balance">budget surpluses</a>, which reduced the state debt to 5.07 billion euro. Combined with the economic growth in that period, the state debt dropped to a record low of 13.7% of GDP, one of the lowest in the European Union. In 2008 Bulgaria also maintained 4.286 billion euro fiscal reserve, meaning that net state debt at this moment was only 0.784 billion euro. After the <a href="Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%9308">2008 financial crisis</a> Bulgaria turned to policy of <a href="Deficit%20spending">budget deficits</a> and at the end of 2013 the state debt rose up to 7.219 billion euro, representing 18.1% of the GDP. In 2015, the debt rate increased further to 26.7% of the GDP, still remaining the third lowest in EU after Estonia and Luxembourg. Part of the increase was driven by the collapse of <a href="Corporate%20Commercial%20Bank">Corporate Commercial Bank</a> in 2014, the fourth largest bank in the country, and the subsequent paying out of <a href="Deposit%20insurance">guaranteed deposits</a>.

In the 1990s, Bulgaria moved gradually away from dependence on markets in the former Soviet sphere, increasing its exports to the European Union (EU). In 1999 Bulgaria joined the Central European Free-Trade Agreement (CEFTA), with whose members (Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia; Macedonia was added in 2006) it has established important trade relations. The admission of all but Croatia and Romania to the EU in 2004 reduced the significance of CEFTA trade, however. In 2004 some 54 percent of Bulgaria’s import trade and 58 percent of its export trade was with EU member countries. Bulgaria has bilateral free-trade agreements with Albania, Croatia, Estonia, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, and Turkey.

In the early 2000s, hydrocarbon fuels remained an important import, although beginning in the late 1990s those commodities’ share of total imports decreased significantly, from 29 percent in 1996 to 13 percent in 2004. During that period, the diversification of imported products
improved as the volume of machinery and equipment, consumer products, and automobiles increased. A large percentage of imports is accounted for by raw materials such as cloth, metal ore, and petroleum, which are processed and re-exported. The most important imports in 2005 were machinery and equipment, metals and ores, chemicals and plastics, fuels, and minerals. The major sources of imports, in order of volume, were Germany, Russia, Italy, Turkey, and Greece. In 2005 Bulgaria’s largest export markets, in order of volume, were Italy, Germany, Turkey,
Greece, and Belgium. The most important export commodities were clothing, footwear, iron and steel, machinery and equipment, and fuels. In 2005 Bulgaria’s exports totaled US$11.7 billion and its imports totaled US$15.9 billion, incurring a trade deficit of US$4.2 billion. The trade deficit is especially severe with Russia, where markets for Bulgarian goods have shrunk drastically in the early 2000s.

In the first half of 2006, Bulgaria had a current account deficit of US$2.3 billion, a substantial increase over the deficit for the same period of 2005, which was some US$1.4 billion. Its trade deficit was US$2.78 billion, foreign direct investment totaled US$1.8 billion, and the financial account balance was US$2.29 billion. In mid-2006 the overall balance of payments was US$883 million, compared with US$755 million for the same period of 2005.

Bulgaria’s large foreign debt has been an economic burden throughout the postcommunist era. At the end of 2005, Bulgaria reported an external debt of US$15.2 billion, an increase in value but a decrease as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 2002 and previous years. As a percentage of GDP, the external debt remained constant between 2004 and 2005.

Beginning in the late 1990s, investment from the West and from Russia has contributed significantly to recovery from the economic crisis of 1996–97, but the rate of investment has remained lower than that in other countries of Eastern Europe. In 2003 the largest national sources of foreign direct investment, in order of volume, were Austria, Greece, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. In 1997 the Belgian Solve company bought the Deny Soda Combine, and in 1999 LUKoil of Russia bought the Neftochim Oil Refinery at Burgas. Union Minière, a Belgian mining company, bought the large Pirdop copper-smelting plant, giving an important boost to Bulgarian nonferrous metallurgy. A number of foreign companies have invested in the chemical fertilizer and food-processing industries In the early 2000s, China invested in the Bulgarian electronics industry. Some cooperative agreements have been made for manufacture of vehicle components. Daimler-Chrysler of Germany has a contract to update Bulgaria’s military transport vehicles between 2003 and 2015. The French Eurocopter company has a bilateral protocol involving a variety of machinery, computer software, and other industrial products. In 2004 Bulgarian oil reserves attracted interest from Melrose Resources of Edinburgh. Russia’s natural gas giant, Gazprom, has pledged investment in Bulgaria’s natural gas infrastructure in exchange for increased purchase of its product. A three-company Israeli consortium agreed in 2004 to work with the domestic Overgas company (which is half-owned by Gazprom) on a major natural-gas distribution network in Bulgaria. In 2005 three European consortia submitted bids for construction of the Belene nuclear power plant. One such investor is the Italian ENEL energy consortium, which also owns the Maritsa–Iztok–3 thermal power plant. In 2006 Russia’s Gazprom company bid against several European energy companies for ownership of newly privatized regional heating utilities, and the Austrian Petromaxx Energy Group invested US$120 million in a new oil refinery at Silistra.

In December 1996, Bulgaria joined the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a>. In the early 1990s Bulgaria's slow pace of privatization, contradictory government tax and investment policies, and bureaucratic red tape kept foreign investment among the lowest in the region. Total direct foreign investment from 1991 through 1996 was $831 million. In the years since 1997, however, Bulgaria has begun to attract substantial foreign investment. In 2004 alone over 2.72 billion Euro (3.47 billion US dollars) were invested by foreign companies. In 2005 economists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euros (2.3 billion US dollars) in <a href="Foreign%20direct%20investment">FDI</a> which is attributed mainly to the end of the privatization of the major state owned companies. After joining the EU in 2007 Bulgaria registered a peak in foreign investment of about 6 billion euros.

Transport in Bulgaria

Transport in <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> is dominated by road transport, despite nearly half of all paved roads belonging to the lowest category of roads. As of December 2015, the country had 774 kilometers of <a href="Highways%20in%20Bulgaria">highways</a>.

Buses play a significant role in long distance public transport, coaches are operated by public and private companies. Sofia has three major national bus terminals, the Central, the Western and the Southern Terminals, and a separate terminal for international routes. In the countryside <a href="share%20taxi">share taxi</a>s are in operation between smaller settlements.

Railway systems are mostly outdated, the average speed is very low, however, upgrading projects are underway. The national railways company is <a href="BD%C5%BD">BDŽ</a>, but private freight operators are also present. The <a href="Sofia%20Metro">Sofia Metro</a> has two lines, and a third is being built as of 2016. 

Air traffic has been growing since the 2000s, which was facilitated by the opening of a second terminal at <a href="Sofia%20Airport">Sofia Airport</a>, as well as the implementation of new destinations and routes. The flag carrier is <a href="Bulgaria%20Air">Bulgaria Air</a>, but a number of private charter companies also exist, operating domestic and international flights.

Ports along the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> are the most important concerning Bulgaria's water transport system. The two largest ports are in <a href="Varna%2C%20Bulgaria">Varna</a> and in <a href="Burgas">Burgas</a>.

After the second terminal of International Airport Sofia was built the total number of passengers for the country rose and reached 6,595,790 in 2008, and in April 2011 Airport Sofia serviced 282 694 passengers, 13% more than the same period of 2009, when the record was 250 000 passengers. In 2011 passenger traffic at Bulgaria's three major airports - Sofia, Varna and Bourgas - grew up to near 10% on the year to 3.89 million in the first half of 2011, due to rise of customers using international routes and launch of new destinations. In 2014, Bulgarian airports served 7,728,612 passengers and handled 23,101 tons of goods.

In the past aviation compared with road and railroad transport used to be a minor mode of freight movement, and only 860,000 passengers used Bulgarian airlines in 2001. In 2013 Bulgaria had 68 airports, 57 of which had paved runways. Two airports, <a href="Sofia%20Airport">Sofia Airport</a> and <a href="Burgas%20Airport">Burgas Airport</a>, had a runway longer than 3,000 meters, and there were four heliports. The second- and third-largest airports, <a href="Varna%20Airport">Varna Airport</a> and <a href="Burgas%20Airport">Burgas Airport</a>, serve mainly charter flights and have regular domestic links with the capital. In the early 2000s, Sofia Airport received substantial renovation, with aid from a <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>i-led consortium, in anticipation of increased air connections with Europe. A three-phase expansion was scheduled for completion in 2010. The communist-era state airline, <a href="Balkan%20Airlines">Balkan Airlines</a>, was replaced by <a href="Bulgaria%20Air">Bulgaria Air</a>, which was privatised in 2006. In 2004 Bulgaria Air transported 365,465 passengers to international destinations, including all major European cities, while in 2014 this number was at 897,422.

In 2005 Bulgaria had some 6,238 kilometers of open access track owned by the state company "National Company Railway Infrastructure", including a 125 kilometers long 760 mm narrow gauge railway - the <a href="Septemvri-Dobrinishte%20narrow%20gauge%20line">Septemvri-Dobrinishte narrow gauge line</a> and 4,316 km were considered main lines. Sofia, Plovdiv and Gorna Oriahovitsa are the hubs of the domestic system and of international rail connections. 

Bulgaria's rail system has not expanded since the 1980s, in 2014 there were 4,023 kilometers of main lines. There are upgrading projects underway. After the completion of the Plovdiv - Dimitrovgrad <a href="high-speed%20rail">high-speed line</a> on 1 July 2012 the top operating speed was raised to 200 km/h and the national top speed record of 197 km/h set between Iskar and Elin Pelin with a leased <a href="Siemens">Siemens</a> Taurus electric locomotive is soon expected to be broken. There are also plans for upgrading for high speed operation and doubling (where needed) of the <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a> - <a href="Burgas">Burgas</a> railway. By the end of 2013, a total of 461 km of <a href="high-speed%20rail">high-speed lines</a> were expected to be built.

In the mid-2000s, railways remained a major mode of freight transportation, but with increasing problems with the maintenance of the infrastructure and lowering speeds, highways carried a progressively larger share of freight. The national passenger and freight operator is called <a href="Bulgarian%20State%20Railways">Bulgarian State Railways</a>, but there are also a number of private operators including Bulgarian Railway Company and <a href="DB%20Schenker">DB Schenker</a> Rail Bulgaria.

In 2014 the Bulgarian railways carried 14,225,000 tons of freight and 21,433,000 people.

In 1998 the first six kilometres of an often-interrupted 52 km standard gauge subway project (the <a href="Sofia%20Metro">Sofia Metro</a>) opened in Sofia. Additional stations were later built, and in 2012 a second line opened. By April 2015 the total length was 36 km with 31 stations and Line 1 <a href="Sofia%20Airport%20Metro%20Station">serving Sofia Airport</a> (SOF). In 2016 the expansion of the network continued, as construction works on the third line commenced, and the system reached a total length of 40 km, with 35 stations along its two lines.

In the early 2000s, Bulgaria had some 37,300 kilometers of roads, but nearly half of which (18,000 kilometers) fell into the lowest international rating for paved roads. 324 kilometers of high-speed highways were in service in 2000. As of December 2014, of national roads and of motorways are in service and 98% of all national roads are paved. Another of highways are under various stages of construction. Roads have overtaken the railroads as the chief mode of freight transportation.

Long-term plans call for upgrading higher-quality roads and integrating the road system into the European grid. The focus is on improving road connectors with the neighbouring countries and domestic connections linking Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas and Varna. Bulgaria has delayed building some key highway connections since the 1990s, but European Union membership is a strong incentive for completion. A 114-kilometer link between eastern Bulgaria and the Turkish border is scheduled for completion in 2013. As of 2004, two international highways passed through Bulgaria, and a major highway ran from Sofia to the Black Sea coast. Proposed international corridors would pass from north to south, from Vidin to the border with Greece and from Ruse to the border with Greece, and west to east, from Serbia through Sofia to Burgas, Varna, and Edirne (Turkey). The <a href="New%20Europe%20Bridge">Vidin-Calafat bridge</a> was completed in 2013, relieving road and railroad traffic to Romania.



Buses are frequently used in Bulgaria for long-distance travel. Long-distance coaches depart from Sofia from the Central, West and South Bus Stations, international routes are served by the Serdika Station. Besides public buses, coaches are also operated by private companies, like Union-Ivkoni, Biomet or Etap-Grup. Tickets can be purchased at the offices of these companies, at stations and from the bus driver. Some companies offer online booking. International destinations include <a href="Saloniki">Saloniki</a>, <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="Bukarest">Bukarest</a>, <a href="Skopje">Skopje</a> and <a href="Belgrad">Belgrad</a>. <a href="Share%20taxi">Share taxi</a>s called "marshrutka" operate in Sofia, and in the countryside between smaller settlements.


In 2005, Bulgaria had 2,425 kilometers of natural gas pipelines, 339 kilometers of oil pipelines, and 156 kilometers of pipelines for refined products. The pipeline system was scheduled for substantial changes and additions, however. The 279-kilometer Burgas-Alexandroupolis Pipeline, still under negotiation among Bulgaria, Greece, and Russia in 2006, would provide a bypass of the overloaded Bosporus Strait. The line would enable Russian oil arriving at the Bulgarian oil port of Burgas to reach Greece’s Mediterranean port at Alexandroupolis. A 900-kilometer U.S.- financed alternate route, known as the AMBO pipeline, would bring oil from Burgas across Bulgaria and Macedonia to the Albanian port of Vlore on the Adriatic Sea, bypassing both the Bosporus and Greece. As of October 2006, approval of both pipelines was expected. With international investment, Bulgaria began constructing a new domestic gas transportation network beginning in 2005. The Russian Gazprom company planned a gas pipeline from Dimitrovgrad in eastern Bulgaria across Serbia, reaching the Adriatic Sea in Croatia. Some 400 kilometers of the planned <a href="Nabucco%20Pipeline">Nabucco Pipeline</a>, bringing gas from Azerbaijan and Iran to Central Europe, were to cross Bulgaria sometime before 2011.

Bulgarian Armed Forces

The Bulgarian Army () represents the Armed Forces of the Republic of <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. The Commander-in-Chief is the <a href="President%20of%20Bulgaria">President of Bulgaria</a> (currently <a href="Rumen%20Radev">Rumen Radev</a>). The Ministry of Defence is in charge of political leadership while overall military command remains in the hands of the Defence Staff, headed by the Chief of the Defence (formerly called the Chief of the General Staff). There are three main branches, named literally the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Naval Forces and the term "Bulgarian Army" encompasses them all together.

Throughout history, the Army has played a major role in defending the country's <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a>. Only several years after its liberation (1878), Bulgaria became a regional military power and was involved in several major wars – <a href="Serbo-Bulgarian%20War">Serbo-Bulgarian War</a> (1885), <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a> (1912–13), <a href="Second%20Balkan%20War">Second Balkan War</a> (1913), <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> (1915–1918) and <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> (1941–1945), during which the Army gained significant combat experience. During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Bulgaria">People's Republic of Bulgaria</a> maintained one of the largest militaries in the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>, numbering an estimated 152,000 troops in 1988. Since the <a href="Fall%20of%20Communism">Fall of Communism</a>, the political leadership decided to pursue a pro-<a href="NATO">NATO</a> policy, thus reducing military personnel and weaponry. Bulgaria joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on 29 March 2004 and currently maintains a total 776 deployed troops in three countries.

The <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of the Bulgarian Army is <a href="St.%20George">St. George</a>. The Armed Forces Day or <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Day">St. George's Day</a> (6 May) is an official holiday in Bulgaria.

The modern Bulgarian military dates back to 1878. On 22 July 1878 (10 July O.S.) a total of 12 battalions of "<a href="opalchentsi">opalchentsi</a>" who participated in the Liberation war, formed the Bulgarian armed forces. According to the <a href="Tarnovo%20Constitution">Tarnovo Constitution</a>, all men between 21 and 40 years of age were eligible for military service. In 1883 the military was reorganized in four infantry <a href="brigades">brigades</a> (in Sofia, Pleven, Ruse and Shumen) and one cavalry <a href="brigade">brigade</a>.

The Serbo-Bulgarian War was the first armed conflict after <a href="Liberation%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria's liberation</a>. It was a result of the <a href="Bulgarian%20unification">unification</a> with <a href="Eastern%20Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</a>, which happened on 6 September 1885. The unification was not completely recognized, however, and one of the countries that refused to recognize the act was the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Kingdom of Serbia</a>. The <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> had been expanding its influence in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> and was particularly opposed. Serbia also feared this would diminish its dominance in the region. In addition, Serbian ruler <a href="Milan%20Obrenovi%C4%87%20IV">Milan Obrenović IV</a> was annoyed that Serbian opposition leaders like <a href="Nikola%20Pa%C5%A1i%C4%87">Nikola Pašić</a>, who had escaped persecution after the <a href="Timok%20Rebellion">Timok Rebellion</a>, had found asylum in Bulgaria. Lured by Austria-Hungary's promises of territorial gains from Bulgaria (in return for concessions in the western Balkans), Milan IV declared war on Bulgaria on 14 November 1885.

Military strategy relied largely on surprise, as Bulgaria had moved most of its troops near the border with the Ottoman Empire, in the southeast. As it happened, the Ottomans did not intervene and the Serbian army's advance was stopped after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Slivnitsa">Battle of Slivnitsa</a>. The main body of the Bulgarian army traveled from the Ottoman border in the southeast to the Serbian border in the northwest to defend the capital, <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>. After the defensive battles at Slivnitsa and <a href="Vidin">Vidin</a>, Bulgaria began an offensive that took the city of <a href="Pirot">Pirot</a>. At this point the Austro-Hungarian Empire stepped in, threatening to join the war on Serbia's side if Bulgarian troops did not retreat. Fighting lasted for only 14 days, from 14–28 November. A peace treaty was signed in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> on 19 February 1886. No territorial changes were made to either country, but Bulgarian unification was recognized by the Great Powers. However, the relationship of trust and friendship between Serbia and Bulgaria, built during their long common fight against Ottoman rule, suffered irreparable damage.

Instability in the Balkan region in the early 1900s quickly became a precondition for a new war. Serbia's aspirations towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were thwarted by the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20annexation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Austrian annexation of the province</a> in October 1908, so the Serbs focused their attention onto their historic cradle, Kosovo, and to the south for expansion. Greek officers, <a href="Goudi%20coup">revolting</a> in August 1909, had secured the appointment of a progressive government under <a href="Eleftherios%20Venizelos">Eleftherios Venizelos</a>, which they hoped would resolve the <a href="History%20of%20Crete%23Modern%20Crete">Cretan issue</a> in Greece's favor and reverse their <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">defeat of 1897 by the Ottomans</a>. Bulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of its independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia, also looked to districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia for expansion.

In March 1910 an <a href="Albanians">Albanian</a> insurrection broke out in Kosovo. In August Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom. In 1911 Italy launched an <a href="Italo-Turkish%20War">invasion of Tripolitania</a>, which was quickly followed by the occupation of the <a href="Dodecanese">Dodecanese</a> Islands. The Italians' decisive military victories over the Ottoman Empire greatly influenced the Balkan states to prepare for war against Turkey. Thus, in the spring of 1912 consultations among the various Christian Balkan nations resulted in a network of military alliances that became known as the <a href="Balkan%20League">Balkan League</a>. The Great Powers, most notably France and Austria-Hungary, reacted to this diplomatic sensation by trying to dissuade the League from going to war, but failed.

In late September both the League and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. Montenegro was the first to declare war, on 25 September (<a href="Old%20Style">O.S.</a>)/ 8 October. The other three states, after issuing an impossible ultimatum to the Porte on 13 October, declared war on Turkey on 17 October. The Balkan League relied on 700,000 troops, 370,000 of whom were Bulgarians. Bulgaria, often dubbed "the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> of the Balkans", was militarily the most powerful of the four states, with a large, well-trained and well-equipped army. The peacetime army of 60,000 troops was expanded during the war to 370,000, with almost 600,000 men mobilized in total out of a population of 4,300,000. The Bulgarian field army consisted of nine infantry divisions, one cavalry division and 1,116 artillery units. Commander-in-Chief was <a href="Ferdinand%20of%20Bulgaria">Tsar Ferdinand</a>, while the actual command was in the hands of his deputy, Gen. Mikhail Savov. The Bulgarians also possessed a small navy of six torpedo boats, which were restricted to operations along the country's <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> coast.
Bulgaria's war aims were focused on <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> and <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>. For the latter, Bulgaria had a secret agreement with Serbia to divide it between them, signed on 13 March 1912 during the negotiations that led to the establishment of the Balkan League. However, it was not a secret that Bulgaria's target was the fulfillment of the never-materialized <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a>, signed after the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%2C%201877%E2%80%9378">Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78</a>. They deployed their main force in Thrace, forming three armies. The <a href="First%20Army%20%28Bulgaria%29">First Army</a>, under Gen. <a href="Vasil%20Kutinchev">Vasil Kutinchev</a> with three infantry divisions, was deployed to the south of <a href="Yambol">Yambol</a>, with direction of operations along the <a href="Tundzha">Tundzha</a> River. The <a href="Second%20Army%28Bulgaria%29">Second Army</a>, under Gen. <a href="Nikola%20Ivanov">Nikola Ivanov</a> with two infantry divisions and one infantry brigade, was deployed west of the First and was assigned to capture the strong fortress of Adrianople (now <a href="Edirne">Edirne</a>). According to the plans, the <a href="Third%20Army%28Bulgaria%29">Third Army</a>, under Gen. <a href="Radko%20Dimitriev">Radko Dimitriev</a>, was deployed east of and behind the First and was covered by the cavalry division hiding it from the Turkish view. The Third Army had three infantry divisions and was assigned to cross the Stranja mountain and to take the fortress of Lozengrad (<a href="Kirk%20Kilisse">Kirk Kilisse</a>). The 2nd and 7th divisions were assigned independent roles, operating in <a href="western%20Thrace">western Thrace</a> and eastern Macedonia, respectively.

The first great battles were at the <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a>–<a href="Kirk%20Kilisse">Kirk Kilisse</a> defensive line, where the Bulgarian 1st and 3rd Armies (together 110,000 men) defeated the Ottoman East Army (130,000 men) near Gechkenli, Seliolu and Petra. The fortress of <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a> was <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople%20%281913%29">besieged</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Kirk%20Kelesse">Kirk Kilisse was taken</a> without resistance under the pressure of the Bulgarian Third Army. The initial Bulgarian attack by First and Third Army defeated the Turkish forces, numbering some 130,000, and reached the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>. However, the Turks, with the aid of fresh reinforcements from the Asian provinces, established their third and strongest defensive position at the <a href="Chataldja">Chataldja</a> Line, across the peninsula where <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> is located. New Turkish forces landed at <a href="Bulair">Bulair</a> and <a href="%C5%9Eark%C3%B6y">Şarköy</a>, but after heavy fighting they were crushed by the newly formed 4th Bulgarian Army under the command of Gen <a href="Stiliyan%20Kovachev">Stiliyan Kovachev</a>. The offensive at <a href="Chataldja">Chataldja</a> failed, too. On 11 March the final Bulgarian <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople%20%281913%29">assault on Adrianople</a> began. Under the command of Gen. <a href="Georgi%20Vazov">Georgi Vazov</a> the Bulgarians, reinforced with two Serb divisions, conquered the "untakeable" city. On 17/30 May a peace treaty was signed between Turkey and the Balkan Alliance. The First Balkan War, which lasted from October 1912-May 1913, strengthened Bulgaria's position as a regional military power, significantly reduced Ottoman influence over the Balkans and resulted in the formation of an independent Albanian state.

The peace settlement of the First Balkan War proved unsatisfactory for both Serbia and Bulgaria. Serbia refused to cede a part of the territories in Macedonia, which it occupied and promised to give to Bulgaria according to a secret agreement. Serbia, on its side, was not satisfied with the independence of Albania and sought a secret alliance with Greece. Armed skirmishes between Serbian and Bulgarian troops occurred.

On 16 June 1913, just a few months after the end of the first war, the Bulgarian government ordered an attack on Serbian and Greek positions in Macedonia, without declaring war. Almost all of Bulgaria's 500,000-man standing army was positioned against these two countries, on two fronts—western and southern—while the borders with Romania and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> were left almost unguarded. Montenegro sent a 12,000-strong force to assist the Serbs. Exhausted from the previous war, which took the highest toll on Bulgaria, the Bulgarian army soon turned to the defensive. Romania attacked from the north and northeast and the Ottoman Empire also intervened in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. Allied numerical superiority was almost 2:1. After a month and two days of fighting, the war ended as a moral disaster for Bulgaria, and at the same time its economy was ruined and its military demoralized.

The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Kingdom of Bulgaria</a> participated in World War I on the side of the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> between 15 October 1915, when the country declared war on <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, and 29 September 1918, when the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Bulgaria">Armistice of Thessalonica</a> was signed. In the aftermath of the <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a>, Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. The government of <a href="Vasil%20Radoslavov">Vasil Radoslavov</a> aligned the country with <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> and <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. However, Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands perceived in Bulgaria as its own.

In 1915 Germany promised to restore the boundaries according to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a> and Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October of that year. In the First World War Bulgaria decisively asserted its military capabilities. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281917%29">second Battle of Doiran</a>, with Gen. <a href="Vladimir%20Vazov">Vladimir Vazov</a> as commander, inflicted a heavy blow on the numerically superior <a href="British%20army">British army</a>, which suffered 12,000 casualties against 2,000 from the opposite side. One year later, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281918%29">third battle of Doiran</a>, the United Kingdom, supported by Greece, once again suffered a humiliating defeat, losing 3,155 men against just about 500 on the Bulgarian side. The reputation of the <a href="French%20army">French army</a> also suffered badly. The <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Wall">Battle of the Red Wall</a> was marked by the total defeat of the French forces, with 5,700 out of 6,000 men killed. The 261 Frenchmen who survived were captured by Bulgarian soldiers.

Despite the outstanding victories, Germany was near defeat, which meant that Bulgaria would be left without its most powerful ally. The <a href="February%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov's government resigned. In 1919 Bulgaria officially left the war with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Neuilly-sur-Seine">Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine</a>.

The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine proved to be a severe blow to Bulgaria's military. According to the treaty, the country had no right to organize a <a href="conscription">conscription</a>-based military. The professional army was to be no more than 20,000 men, including internal forces and border guards. Equipping the army with tanks, submarines, bombers and heavy artillery was strictly prohibited, although Bulgaria managed to get around some of these prohibitions. Nevertheless, on the eve of World War II the Bulgarian army was still well-trained and well-equipped.

The government of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Kingdom of Bulgaria</a> under Prime Minister <a href="Bogdan%20Filov">Bogdan Filov</a> declared a position of neutrality upon the outbreak of World War II. Bulgaria was determined to observe it until the end of the warm but it hoped for bloodless territorial gains, especially in the lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighboring countries after the <a href="Second%20Balkan%20War">Second Balkan War</a> and World War I. However, it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both World War II factions. Turkey had a <a href="non-aggression%20pact">non-aggression pact</a> with Bulgaria. On 7 September 1940 Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating a recovery of <a href="Southern%20Dobruja">Southern Dobruja</a> with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Craiova">Treaty of Craiova</a> (see <a href="Second%20Vienna%20Award">Second Vienna Award</a>). Southern Dobruja had been part of Romania since 1913. This recovery of territory reinforced hopes for resolving other territorial problems without direct involvement in the war. The country joined the <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis Powers</a> in 1941, when <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> troops preparing to invade <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> and Greece reached the Bulgarian borders and demanded permission to pass through its territory.

On 1 March 1941, Bulgaria signed the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a> and Tsar <a href="Boris%20III%20of%20Bulgaria">Boris III</a> officially joined the Axis bloc. After a short period of inaction, the army launched an operation against <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> and Greece. The goal of reaching the shores of the <a href="Aegean%20sea">Aegean sea</a> and completely occupying the region of Macedonia was successful. Even though Bulgaria did not send any troops to support the <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">German invasion of the Soviet Union</a>, its navy was involved in a number of skirmishes with the <a href="Soviet%20Black%20Sea%20Fleet">Soviet Black Sea Fleet</a>, which attacked Bulgarian shipping. Besides this, Bulgarian armed forces garrisoned in the Balkans battled various resistance groups. The Bulgarian government declared a token war on the United Kingdom and the United States near the end of 1941, an act that resulted in the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Sofia%20in%20World%20War%20II">bombing of Sofia</a> and other Bulgarian cities by <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> aircraft.

Some communist activists managed to begin a guerrilla movement, headed by the underground <a href="Bulgarian%20Communist%20Party">Bulgarian Communist Party</a>. A resistance movement called <a href="Fatherland%20Front%20%28Bulgaria%29">Otechestven front</a> (Fatherland front, Bulgarian: Отечествен фронт) was set up in August 1942 by the Communist Party, the <a href="Zveno">Zveno</a> movement and a number of other parties to oppose the elected government, after a number of Allied victories indicated that the Axis might lose the War. In 1943 Tsar <a href="Boris%20III">Boris III</a> died suddenly. In the summer of 1944, after having crushed the Nazi defense around <a href="Ia%C5%9Fi">Iaşi</a> and <a href="Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u">Chişinău</a>, the <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet Army</a> was approaching the Balkans and Bulgaria. On 23 August 1944 Romania quit the Axis Powers, declared war on Germany and allowed Soviet forces to cross its territory to reach Bulgaria. On 26 August 1944 the Fatherland Front made the decision to incite an armed rebellion against the government, which led to the appointment of a new government on 2 September. Support for the government was withheld by the Fatherland Front, since it was composed of pro-Nazi elements, in a desperate attempt to hold on to power. On 5 September 1944 the Soviet Union declared war and invaded Bulgaria. On 8 September 1944 the Bulgarian army joined the Soviet Union in its war against Germany.

As the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> invaded Bulgaria in 1944 and installed a communist government, the armed forces were rapidly forced to reorganise following the Soviet model, and were renamed the <a href="Bulgarian%20People%27s%20Army">Bulgarian People's Army</a> ("Bulgarska Narodna Armiya, BNA"). Moscow quickly supplied Bulgaria with <a href="T-34-85">T-34-85</a> tanks, <a href="SU-100">SU-100</a> guns, <a href="Il-2">Il-2</a> attack planes and other new combat machinery. As the country was a Soviet satellite, it was a part of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> and entered the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> as one of its founders. By this time the army had expanded to over 200,000 men with hundreds of thousands of more reserve troops. Military service was obligatory. A special <a href="defensive%20line">defensive line</a>, known as the <a href="Krali%20Marko%20defensive%20line">Krali Marko defensive line</a>, was constructed along the entire border with Turkey. It was heavily fortified with concrete walls and turrets of T-34, <a href="Panzer%20III">Panzer III</a> and <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a> tanks.

The army was involved in a number of border skirmishes from 1948 to 1952, repulsing several Greek attacks, and took part in the suppression of the <a href="Prague%20spring">Prague spring</a> events. In the meantime, during the rule of <a href="Todor%20Zhivkov">Todor Zhivkov</a>, a significant military-industrial complex was established, capable of producing armored vehicles, self-propelled artillery, small arms and ammunition, as well as aircraft engines and spare parts. Bulgaria provided weapons and military expertise to Algeria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Nicaragua, Egypt and Syria. Some military and medical aid was also supplied to North Korea and <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> in the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s the Air Force was at the apogee of its power, possessing at least 500 modern combat aircraft in its inventory. Training in the Bulgarian People's Army was exhaustive even by Soviet standards; however, it was never seen as a major force within the Warsaw Pact. In 1989, when the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> was coming to its end, the army (the combined number of ground, air and naval forces) numbered about 120,000 men, most of them conscripts. There were, however, a number of services which, while falling outside of Ministry of Defense jurisdiction in peacetime, were considered part of the armed forces. These were foremost the Labor Troops (construction forces), the <a href="Militsiya">People's Militia</a> (the police forces of the country, which fell under Ministry of the Interior jurisdiction, but the ministry was itself a militarized structure) and, more importantly, its Interior Troops, the Border Troops—which in different periods fell under either Ministry of Defense or Ministry of the Interior control—Civil Defense Service, the Signals Troops (government communications) and the Transport Troops (mostly railway infrastructure maintenance), which were two separate services under the Postal and Communications Committee (a ministry), etc. The combined strength of the Bulgarian People's Army and all those services reached well over 325,000 troops.

With the collapse of the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> and the end of the <a href="Cold%20war">Cold war</a>, Bulgaria could no longer support a vast military. A rapid reduction in personnel and active equipment was to be carried out in parallel with a general re-alignment of strategic interests. In 1990, Bulgaria had a total of more than 2,400 tanks, 2,000 armored vehicles, 2,500 large caliber artillery systems, 300 fighter and bomber aircraft, 100 trainer aircraft, more than 40 combat and 40 transport helicopters, 4 submarines, 6 fast missile craft, 2 frigates, 5 corvettes, 6 torpedo boats, 9 patrol craft, 30 minesweepers and 21 transport vessels. Due to the economic crisis that affected most former Eastern bloc countries, a steady reform in the military could not be carried out; much of the equipment fell into disrepair and some of it was smuggled and sold to the international black market. Inadequate payments, fuel and spare part shortages and the disbandment of many capable units led to an overall drop in combat readiness, morale and discipline.

After partially recovering from the 1990s crisis, the Bulgarian military became a part of the collective defensive system of <a href="NATO">NATO</a>. As a member, Bulgaria sent a total of 485 soldiers to Iraq (2003–2008) as a participant in the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>, and currently maintains a 608-strong force in Afghanistan as part of <a href="ISAF">ISAF</a>. Bulgaria had a significant missile arsenal, including 67 <a href="SCUD">SCUD-B</a>, 50 <a href="FROG-7">FROG-7</a> and 24 <a href="SS-23">SS-23</a> ballistic missiles. In 2002, Bulgaria disbanded the <a href="Bulgarian%20Rocket%20Forces">Rocket Forces</a> despite nationwide protests, and has disbanded its submarine component. Bulgaria is to have 27,000 standing troops by 2014, consisting of 14,310 troops in the land forces, 6,750 in the air force, 3,510 in the navy and 2,420 in the joint command.

The Bulgarian Armed Forces are headquartered in <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, where most of the Defence staff is based. Until recently the supreme military institution was the General Staff and the most senior military officer was known as the Chief of the General Staff. After the latest military reform has been implemented the General Staff became a department within the Ministry of Defence and for that matter its name had to be changed to match the new situation. For that reason the former GS became the Defence Staff and the supreme military commander became the Chief of Defence. Currently headed by Chief of Defence general <a href="Simeon%20Simeonov%20%28general%29">Simeon Simeonov</a>, the Defence Staff is responsible for operational command of the Bulgarian Army and its 3 major branches. Deputies: Vice Admiral Petar Petrov, General Atanas Zaprianov, General Dimitar Zekhtinov.

General rank positions in the Bulgarian Army:

Ministry of Defence

In addition to the afforementioned positions, there are general rank positions in the National Intelligence Service and the National Close Protection Service (the bodyguard service to high-ranking officials and visiting dignitaries). These two services are considered part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, but are directly subordinated to the President of Bulgaria and fall out of the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense.


With the establishment of the <a href="State%20Agency%20for%20National%20Security">State Agency for National Security</a> - SANS (Bulgarian: Darzhavna Agentsiya za Natsionalna Sigurnost - DANS, Държавна агенция за национална сигурност - ДАНС) part of the military security personnel came under its authority. Before that the security aspects of the armed forces were handled by a unified organisation under the General Staff - the "Military Service of Security and Military Police". After the formation of SANS the service was split, with the military counter-intelligence personnel entering the newly formed structure and the military police personnel staying under Ministry of Defense subordination. While technically civilian servants not part of the armed forces, the military counter-intelligence personnel of the State Agency of National Security retain their military ranks.

Ministry of Defence<br>
The organisation of the Ministry of Defence includes:

Structures directly subordinated to the Ministry of Defence include:

The Defence Staff, formerly called the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, is the supreme professional institution for military expertise and command and supervision of the armed forces under the Ministry of Defence umbrella. It includes:

In 2010 the Ministry of Defence completed a thorough study of the defence policy and issued a "White Book", or a "White Paper on Defence", calling for a major overhaul of the structure of Defence Forces. According to the document the military of the Republic of Bulgaria should include two mechanized <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s, four regiments (Logistics, Artillery, Engineering, SpecOps), four <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s (Reconnaissance, Mechanized, NBC, PsyOps) in the Land Forces; two air bases, SAM air defense base and Air force training base in the Air Force; and one naval base consisting of two homeports in the Navy. The brigade formations are 7, including the two mechanised brigades and the special forces brigade of the army, the two air bases of the air force, the naval base and the logistical brigade of the JOC. Currently deployed units are as follows:

Joint Forces Command

The three armed services of the Bulgarian Army - the Land, Air and Naval Forces are subordinated to the recently formed Joint Forces Command:
The <a href="68th%20Special%20Forces%20Brigade%20%28Bulgaria%29">68th Special Forces Brigade</a> left the Land Forces on February 1, 2017, de facto becoming the country's fourth combat service. Unlike Bulgaria's Land, Air and Naval Forces however it falls outside of the Joint Forces Command structure, having been assigned directly under the authority of the Chief of Defence.

Bulgaria's total military personnel as of 2014 is 37,100, of which 30,400 (80.1%) are active military personnel and 8,100 (11.9%) are civilian personnel. The Land Forces are the largest branch, with at least 18,000 men serving there. In terms of percentage, 53% of all Army personnel are in the Land Forces, 25% are in the Air Force, 13% are in the Navy and 9% are in the Joint Forces Command. Annual spending per soldier amounts to 30,000 leva (~ 15,000 euro) and is scheduled to increase to 43,600 leva by 2014.

Unlike many former Soviet bloc militaries, <a href="discipline">discipline</a> and morale problems are not common. During the Communist era, the army members enjoyed extensive social privileges. After the fall of Communism and Bulgaria's transition to a <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a>, wages fell severely. For almost a decade social benefits were virtually non-existent, and some of them have been restored but recently. <a href="Nikolai%20Tsonev">Nikolai Tsonev</a>, defence minister under the 2005–2009 cabinet, undertook steps to provide the members of the military and their families with certain privileges in terms of healthcare and education, and to improve living conditions.

Military education in Bulgaria is provided in military universities and academies. Due to cuts in spending and manpower some universities have been disbanded and their campuses were included as faculties of other, larger educational entities. The largest institutions of military education in Bulgaria are:

The Land Forces practice extensive year-round military training in various conditions. Cooperative drills with the United States are very common, the last series of them conducted in 2008. Bulgaria's most recent full-scale exercise simulating a foreign invasion was carried out in 2009. It was conducted at the <a href="Koren%20range">Koren range</a>, and included some 1,700 personnel with tanks, ATGMs, attack aircraft, AA guns and armored vehicles. The combat skills of individual soldiers are on a very high level, on par with troops of the U.S. Army.

Until recent years the Air Force suffered somewhat from fuel shortages; a problem which was overcome in 2008. Fighter pilots have year-round flights, but gunship pilots do not fly often due to the yet unfulfilled modernization of the <a href="Mi-24">Mi-24</a> gunships. Due to financial difficulties fighter pilots have 60 hours of flying time per year, only a third of the national norm of 180 hours.

The Navy also has some fuel shortage problems, but military training is still effective. The most recent overseas operation of the Navy was along the coast of Libya as part of <a href="Operation%20Unified%20Protector">Operation Unified Protector</a>.

After the collapse of the Warsaw pact, Bulgaria lost the ability to acquire cheap fuel and spares for its military. A large portion of its nearly 2,000 <a href="T-55">T-55</a> tanks fell into disrepair, and eventually almost all of them were scrapped or sold to other countries. In the early 1990s the budget was so small, that regulars only received token-value payments. Many educated and well-trained officers lost the opportunity to educate younger soldiers, as the necessary equipment and basis lacked adequate funding. Military spending increased gradually, especially in the last 10 years. As of 2005, the budget was no more than $400 mln., while military spending for 2009 amounted to more than $1.3 bln. – almost a triple increase for 4 years. Despite this growth, the military still does not receive sufficient funds for modernization. An example of bad spending plans is the large-scale purchasing of transport aircraft, while the Air Force has a severe need of new fighters (the <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a>s, even though modernized, are nearing their operational limits). The planned procurement of 2–4 <a href="Gowind%20class%20corvette">Gowind class corvette</a>s has been cancelled. As of 2009, military spending were about 1.98% of GDP. In 2010 the budget is to be only 1.3% due to the international financial crisis.

The Land Forces are functionally divided into Deployable and Reserve Forces. Their main functions include deterrence, defence, peace support and <a href="crisis%20management">crisis management</a>, humanitarian and rescue missions, as well as social functions within Bulgarian society. Active troops in the land forces number about 18,000 men, and reserve troops number about 13,000.

The equipment of the land forces is impressive in terms of numbers, but most of it is nonoperational and scheduled to be scrapped or refurbished and exported to other nations. Bulgaria has a military stockpile of about 5,000,000 small arms, models ranging from World War II-era <a href="MP%2040">MP 40</a> machine pistols to modern <a href="Steyr%20AUG">Steyr AUG</a>, <a href="AK-74">AK-74</a>, HK <a href="MP5">MP5</a>, <a href="HK416">HK416</a> and AR-M12F assault rifles.

The National Guard of Bulgaria, founded in 1879, is the successor to the personal guards of <a href="Knyaz">Knyaz</a> <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Alexander I</a>. On 12 July of that year, the guards escorted the Bulgarian <a href="knyaz">knyaz</a> for the first time; today the official holiday of the National Guard is celebrated on 12 July. Throughout the years the structure of the guards has evolved, going from convoy to squadron, to regiment and, subsequent to 1942, to division. Today it includes military units for army salute and wind orchestra duties.

In 2001, the National Guard unit was designated an official military unit of the Bulgarian army and one of the symbols of state authority, along with the flag, the coat of arms and the national anthem. It is a formation, directly subordinate to the Minister of Defence and while legally part of the armed forces, it is totally independent from the Defence Staff.

"Note": This table represents active equipment only; there are large numbers of equipment in reserve status. They are not listed here. 

The Navy has traditionally been the smallest component of the Bulgarian military. Established almost simultaneously with the Ground forces in 1879, initially it consisted of a small fleet of boats on the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> river. Bulgaria has a coastline of about 354 kilometers – thus, naval warfare is not considered a priority.

After the downturn in 1990, the Navy was largely overlooked and received almost no funding. No projects for modernization were carried out until 2005, when a <a href="Wielingen%20class%20frigate">Wielingen class frigate</a> (F912 Wandelaar) was acquired from Belgium. By 2009, Bulgaria acquired two more frigates of the same class. The first of them was renamed "41 Drazki" and took part in several operations and exercises, most notably the <a href="UNIFIL">UNIFIL</a> Maritime Patrol along the coast of Lebanon in 2006, and <a href="Operation%20Active%20Endeavour">Operation Active Endeavour</a>. It also participated in the enforcement the naval blockade against <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>'s regime off the coast of Libya in 2011 until 2012.

The equipment is typical for a small navy, consisting mostly of light multi-purpose vessels – 4 <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s, 3 <a href="corvette">corvette</a>s, 5 minesweepers, 3 fast missile craft and 2 landing ships. Other equipment includes a coastal defence missile battalion armed with locally modified <a href="P-15%20Termit">P-15 Termit</a> missiles, a coastal artillery battery, a naval helicopter airbase and a marine special forces unit.

The Bulgarian Navy is centered in two main bases – in <a href="Varna">Varna</a> and in <a href="Burgas">Burgas</a>.

In the past decade Bulgaria has been trying actively to restructure its army as a whole and a lot of attention has been placed on keeping the aging Russian aircraft operational. Currently the attack and defence branches of the Bulgarian air force are mainly <a href="MiG-21">MiG-21</a>s, <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a>s and <a href="Su-25">Su-25</a>s. About 16 <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a> fighters have been modernized in order to meet <a href="NATO">NATO</a> standards. The first aircraft arrived on 29 November 2007 and final delivery was due in 03/09. In 2006 the Bulgarian government signed a contract with <a href="Alenia%20Aeronautica">Alenia Aeronautica</a> for the delivery of five <a href="C-27J%20Spartan">C-27J Spartan</a> transport aircraft in order to replace the Soviet made <a href="An-24">An-24</a> and <a href="An-26">An-26</a>, although the contract was later changed to only three aircraft. Modern EU-made transport helicopters were purchased in 2005 and a total of 12 <a href="Eurocopter%20Cougar">Eurocopter Cougar</a> have been delivered (8 transport and 4 CSAR).3 Eurocopter AS565 Panther for the Bulgarian navy in 2016.

Branches of the airforce include: fighter aviation, assault aviation, intelligence aviation and transportation aviation, aid defence troops, radio-technical troops, communications troops, radio-technical support troops, logistics and medical troops.

The Bulgarian ministry of defense has announced plans to withdraw and replace the MiG-21 fighters with new ones. Several offers were received from international suppliers – the United States (offering <a href="F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a> and <a href="F-18%20Super%20Hornet">F-18 Super Hornet</a>), Sweden <a href="JAS-39%20Gripen">JAS-39 Gripen</a>), Germany (<a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a>), Italy (second-hand <a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a>), Russia (<a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a>) and Israel (<a href="IAI%20Kfir">IAI Kfir</a>).

With the exception of the Navy's small helicopter fleet, the Air Forces are responsible for all military aircraft in Bulgaria. The Air Forces' inventory numbers 124 aircraft, including 46 combat jets and 42 helicopters. Aircraft of western origin have only begun to enter the fleet, numbering 13 of the total in service.

The Bulgarian-American Joint Military Facilities were established by a Defence Cooperation Agreement signed by the United States and Bulgaria in April 2006.

Under the agreement, no more than 2,500 U.S. military personnel can be located at the joint military facilities.

Geography of Burkina Faso

<a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> (formerly Upper Volta) is a landlocked <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> country that shares borders with six nations. It lies between the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> desert and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Guinea">Gulf of Guinea</a>, south of the loop of the <a href="Niger%20River">Niger River</a>, mostly between latitudes 9° and 15°N (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes 6°W and 3°E. The land is green in the south, with forests and fruit trees, and desert in the north. Most of central Burkina Faso lies on a <a href="savanna">savanna</a> plateau, above sea level, with fields, brush, and scattered trees. Burkina Faso's game preserves—the most important of which are <a href="Arli%20National%20Park">Arly</a>, <a href="Nazinga%20Game%20Ranch">Nazinga</a>, and <a href="W%20National%20Park">W National Park</a>—contain <a href="Panthera%20leo">lion</a>s, <a href="elephant">elephant</a>s, <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a>, <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s, <a href="common%20warthog">common warthog</a>s, and <a href="antelope">antelope</a>s. Previously the endangered <a href="painted%20hunting%20dog">painted hunting dog</a>, "Lycaon pictus" occurred in Burkina Faso, but, although the last sightings were made in <a href="Arli%20National%20Park">Arli National Park</a>, the species is considered <a href="extirpated">extirpated</a> from Burkina Faso. Tourism is not well developed.

Burkina Faso has a total area of 274,200 km, of which 273,800 km is land and 400 km water. Comparatively, it is slightly larger than <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>. Its borders total 3,611 km: <a href="Benin">Benin</a> 386 km, <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a> 545 km, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> 602 km, <a href="Mali">Mali</a> 1,325 km, <a href="Niger">Niger</a> 622 km, and <a href="Togo">Togo</a> 131 km. It has no coastline or maritime claims.

This is a list of the extreme points of <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.


It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a <a href="peneplain">peneplain</a>, which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a Precambrian massif. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a sandstone massif, where the highest peak, Ténakourou, is found at an elevation of . The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than . Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country. Its elevation extremes are a lowest point at the <a href="Mouhoun%20River">Mouhoun</a> (<a href="Black%20Volta">Black Volta</a>) River (200 m) and highest point at <a href="Tena%20Kourou">Tena Kourou</a> (749 m).

The country is divided into <a href="Regions%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">13 administrative regions</a>. These regions encompass <a href="Provinces%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">45 provinces</a> and <a href="Departments%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">351 departments</a>.

The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the Black Volta (or Mouhoun), the White Volta (Nakambé) and the Red Volta (Nazinon). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the Komoé, which flows to the southwest. The basin of the Niger River also drains 27% of the country's surface.

The Niger's tributaries – the Béli, the Gorouol, the Goudébo and the Dargol – are seasonal streams and flow for only four to six months a year. They still, however, can cause large floods. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, Bam and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli and Markoye. Water shortages are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.

Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between 600 and 900 millimetres (23.6 and 35.4 in) of rainfall; in the dry season, the <a href="harmattan">harmattan</a> – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The Sahel in the north typically receives less than [13] of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, .

A relatively dry tropical savanna, the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the Sahara to its north and the fertile region of the Sudan to the South. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north latitude, the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than [13] of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.

Burkina Faso's natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt and small deposits of <a href="Mining%20in%20Burkina%20Faso">gold</a>. 21.93% of its land is arable, and 0.26% has permanent crops as of 2012. As of 2003, 250 km were irrigated. Its total renewable water resources as of 2011 were 12.5 m, with a total freshwater withdrawal of 0.72 km/yr (46% domestic, 3% industrial, 51% agricultural; this amounts to a per-capita withdrawal of 54.99 m/yr.

Burkina Faso's fauna and flora are protected in two national parks and several reserves: see <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20in%20Africa">List of national parks in Africa</a>, <a href="Nature%20reserves%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">Nature reserves of Burkina Faso</a>.

Recurring <a href="drought">drought</a>s and <a href="flood">flood</a>s are a significant natural hazard. Current environmental issues include: recent droughts and <a href="desertification">desertification</a> severely affecting agricultural activities, population distribution, and the economy; <a href="overgrazing">overgrazing</a>; <a href="soil%20degradation">soil degradation</a>; <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>.

Demographics of Burkina Faso

This article is about the <a href="demographics">demographic</a> features of the <a href="population">population</a> of <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, including <a href="population%20density">population density</a>, <a href="Ethnic%20group">ethnicity</a>, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
<a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>'s /1e6 round 1 million people belong to two major West African cultural groups—the <a href="Gur%20people">Gur</a> (Voltaic) and the <a href="Mand%C3%A9">Mandé</a>. The Voltaic are far more numerous and include the <a href="Mossi%20people">Mossi</a>, who make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi are still bound by the traditions of the <a href="Mogho%20Naba">Mogho Naba</a>, who hold court in <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>.

About 12,000 Europeans reside in Burkina Faso, the majority of whom are French.

Most of Burkina Faso's population is concentrated in the south and center of the country, with a population density sometimes exceeding . This population density, high for Africa, causes annual migrations of hundreds of thousands of Burkinabé to <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a> and <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> for seasonal agricultural work. About a third of Burkinabé adhere to traditional African religions. The introduction of Islam to Burkina Faso was initially resisted by the Mossi rulers. Christians, predominantly <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>s, are largely concentrated among the urban elite.

Few Burkinabé have had formal education. Schooling is free but not compulsory, and only about 29% of Burkina's primary school-age children receive a basic education. The <a href="University%20of%20Ouagadougou">University of Ouagadougou</a>, founded in 1974, was the country's first institution of higher education. The <a href="Polytechnic%20University%20of%20Bobo-Dioulasso">Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso</a> in <a href="Bobo-Dioulasso">Bobo-Dioulasso</a> was opened in 1995.

<doc id="3679" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3679" title="Politics of Burkina Faso">
Politics of Burkina Faso

The Politics of Burkina Faso takes place in a framework of a <a href="Semi-presidential%20system">semi-presidential</a> <a href="republic">republic</a>, whereby the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">Prime Minister of Burkina Faso</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>, and of a <a href="multi-party%20system">multi-party system</a>. The <a href="President%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">President of Burkina Faso</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>. <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by both the President and the Government. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the <a href="Forms%20of%20government">government</a> and parliament. The party system was dominated by the <a href="Congress%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Progress">Congress for Democracy and Progress</a> until the <a href="2014%20Burkinab%C3%A9%20uprising">2014 Burkinabé uprising</a>. Since then, the <a href="Congress%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Progress">Congress for Democracy and Progress</a> has lost influence. The <a href="Judiciary">Judiciary</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature.

In 1990, the <a href="Popular%20Front%20%28Burkina%20Faso%29">Popular Front</a> held its first National Congress, which formed a committee to draft a national constitution. The constitution was approved by referendum in 1991. In 1992, <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Blaise Compaoré</a> was elected president, running unopposed after the opposition boycotted the election because of Compaoré's refusal to accede to demands of the opposition such as a sovereign National Conference to set modalities. The opposition did participate in the following year's legislative elections, in which the <a href="ODP/MT">ODP/MT</a> won a majority of the seats contested for.

The government of the Fourth Republic includes a strong presidency, a prime minister, a Council of Ministers presided over by the president, a National Assembly, and the judiciary. The legislature and judiciary are independent but remain susceptible to outside influence.

In 1995, Burkina held its first multiparty municipal elections since independence. The president's ODP/MT won over 1,100 of some 1,700 councillor seats being contested.

In February 1996, the ruling ODP/MT merged with several small opposition parties to form the <a href="Congress%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Progress">Congress for Democracy and Progress</a> (CDP). This effectively co-opted much of what little viable opposition to Compaoré existed. The remaining opposition parties regrouped in preparation for 1997 legislative elections and the 1998 presidential election. The 1997 legislative elections, which international observers pronounced to be substantially free, fair, and transparent, resulted in a large CDP majority—101 to 111 seats.

The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and may serve up to two terms. The prime minister is appointed by the president with the consent of the legislature.
The constitution of June 2, 1991, established a semi-presidential government with a parliament (Assemblée) which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of 5 years. The year 2000 saw a constitutional amendment reducing the presidential term from 7 to 5 years, which was enforced during the 2005 elections. Another change according to the amendment would have prevented sitting president <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Blaise Compaoré</a> from being re-elected. However, notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates, in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that because Compaoré was already a sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office, thereby clearing the way for his candidacy in <a href="Burkina%20Faso%20presidential%20elections%2C%202005">the 2005 election</a>. On November 13 Compaoré was reelected in a landslide due to a divided political opposition. In 2010, Compaoré was once again re-elected, and the term limit requirement was held to not apply to him. A proposed constitutional amendment in 2014 would have permitted him to run again, but public resistance led to the <a href="2014%20Burkinab%C3%A9%20uprising">2014 Burkinabé uprising</a>, and Compaoré resigned on 31 October 2014. A transitional government headed by President <a href="Michel%20Kafondo">Michel Kafondo</a> and Prime Minister <a href="Isaac%20Zida">Isaac Zida</a> took power for a one-year mandate. Elections were to have been held in October, 2015, but members of the <a href="Regiment%20of%20Presidential%20Security">Regiment of Presidential Security</a> launched <a href="2015%20Burkinab%C3%A9%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">a coup</a> on 16 September 2015, detaining President Kafando and Prime Minister Zida. RSP commander <a href="Gilbert%20Diend%C3%A9r%C3%A9">Gilbert Diendéré</a> named himself the head of the new <a href="military%20junta">military junta</a>, but popular resistance, backed by army and gendarmerie forces not aligned with the RSP, forced his resignation and the restoration of the transitional government a week later.

According to the constitution, the Parliament votes on the law, consents to taxation, and controls the actions of the government under provisions of the constitution. The Parliament, made up of the National Assembly and Senate, meets each year in two ordinary sessions, each of which may not exceed ninety days. The first session opens on the first Wednesday of March and the second the last Wednesday of September. If either of these days lands on a holiday, the session opens the next first working day. Each chamber of Parliament meets in extraordinary session on request of the President, demand of the Prime Minister, or of an absolute majority of half of the Deputies or Senators on a specific agenda and closes at the completion of said agenda.
The <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">National Assembly</a> ("Assemblée Nationale") has 111 members, named Deputies, and are elected for a five-year term by <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a>.

The <a href="Senate%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">Senate</a>, as described in the Constitution of Burkina Faso, would consist of representatives from local government divisions, customary and religious authorities, workers, employers, Burkinabes abroad and people appointed by the President of Burkina Faso and serve a term of six years. The constitution requires that anyone elected or appointed must be 45 years old by the day of the ballot.

In May 2013, then President Compaoré announced the establishment of a new Senate with 89 members, 29 of which would be selected by the president themselves, and the rest appointed by local officials. With Senate elections being held in July 2013, government opposition groups warned against a legislative body with a majority of handpicked sympathizers by the president. Compaoré was successful in appointing 1/3rd of the Senate, prompting protesters rallying in the streets of <a href="Bobo-Dioulasso">Bobo-Dioulasso</a> and the capital <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a> to protest the establishment of the Senate, which has since been postponed.

The Presidents of both the Senate and National Assembly are elected for the duration of the legislator by an absolute majority of half the chamber in the first round of voting, or a simple majority in the second round. Their functions can be terminated during the course of a legislature at the demand of two-fifths and a vote of absolute majority of the members of the Assembly. In the case of vacancy of the presidency of either chamber of Parliament by death,resignation, or other reason, said chamber elects a new President by the same method. Each chamber has financial autonomy, with the President of said chamber managing the credits allocated to them for the functioning of chamber, but with a vote of absolute majority the chamber can dismiss the President for incompetence in managing finances.
Except in the case of <a href="In%20flagrante%20delicto">In flagrante delicto</a>, any member of Parliament can only be prosecuted or arrested in a penal or criminal matter with the authorization of at least one-third members of the chamber which they reside.

Economy of Burkina Faso

<a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> has an average income purchasing-power-parity per capita of $1,666 and nominal per capita of $790 in 2014. More than 80% of the population relies on <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a>, with only a small fraction directly involved in <a href="industry">industry</a> and <a href="tertiary%20sector%20of%20industry">services</a>. Highly variable rainfall, poor <a href="soil">soil</a>s, lack of adequate communications and other <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a>, a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems of this landlocked country. The <a href="export">export</a> economy also remains subject to fluctuations in world prices.

The country has a high population density, few <a href="natural%20resource">natural resource</a>s, and a fragile <a href="soil">soil</a>. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled corporations. Following the African franc currency devaluation in January 1994 the government updated its development program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased. Maintenance of its <a href="macroeconomics">macroeconomic</a> progress depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage private investment.

The Burkinabé financial system represents 30% of the country’s GDP and is dominated by the banking sector, which accounts for 90% of total financial system assets. Eleven banks and five <a href="non-bank%20financial%20institution">non-bank financial institution</a>s operate in the country.

The banking sector is highly concentrated, with the three largest banks holding nearly 60% of total financial sector assets. Banks are generally adequately capitalized, but remain vulnerable due to their overexposure to the cotton sector, the prices of which are subject to significant oscillations.

As of 2007, the World Bank estimated that 26% of the Burkinabé population has access to financial services. The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) reports that about 41 microfinance institutions (MFIs) operate in the country, serving a total of 800,000 customers. Burkina Faso is a member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeurs Mobilières (BRVM) located in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. As of 2009, the regional stock exchange’s market capitalization reached nearly 10% of Burkina Faso’s GDP.

Burkina Faso was ranked the 111th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.

This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Burkina Faso at market prices <a href="http%3A//www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm%3FG%3D2001">estimated</a> by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of CFA Francs.
For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar is exchanged at 470.70 CFA Francs only. Mean wages were $0.56 per <a href="man-hour">man-hour</a> in 2009.
Current GDP per capita of Burkina Faso grew 13% in the Sixties reaching a peak growth of 237% in the Seventies. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled back to 23% in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 37% in the Nineties. Average wages in 2007 hover around 2 to 3 dollars per day.

Although handicapped by an extremely resource-deprived domestic economy, Burkina Faso remains committed to the <a href="structural%20adjustment%20program">structural adjustment program</a> it launched in 1991. It has largely recovered from the devaluation of the CFA in January 1994, with a 1996 growth rate of 5.9%.

Many Burkinabé migrate to neighbouring countries for work, and their remittances provide a substantial contribution to the balance of payments. Burkina Faso is attempting to improve the economy by developing its <a href="mineral">mineral</a> resources, improving its infrastructure, making its <a href="agriculture">agricultural and livestock sectors</a> more productive and competitive, and stabilizing the supplies and prices of <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s.

The agricultural economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. The <a href="Mossi%20Plateau">Mossi Plateau</a> in north central Burkina Faso faces encroachment from the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>. The resultant southward migration means heightened competition for control of very limited <a href="water%20resources">water resources</a> south of the Mossi Plateau. Most of the population ekes out a living as subsistence farmers, living with problems of climate, <a href="erosion">soil erosion</a>, and rudimentary technology. The staple crops are <a href="pearl%20millet">pearl millet</a>, <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="maize">maize</a>, and <a href="rice">rice</a>. The cash crops are <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, <a href="peanut">groundnuts</a>, <a href="Shea%20nut">karite (shea nuts)</a>, and <a href="sesame">sesame</a>.

Telecommunications in Burkina Faso

Telecommunications in Burkina Faso include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

Radio is the country's most popular communications medium. Use of telecommunications in <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> are extremely low, limited due to the low penetration of electricity, even in major cities. There were just 141,400 fixed line phones in use in 2012, in a country with a population of 17.4 million. Use of mobile phones has skyrocketed from 1.0 million lines in 2006 to 10 million in 2012. Internet use is also low, with only 3.7 users per 100 inhabitants in 2012, just over 643,000 users total. The Internet penetration rate in Africa as a whole was 16 users per 100 inhabitants in 2013.

The constitution and law provide for <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and of the <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">press</a>, and the government generally respects these rights in practice.

All media are under the administrative and technical supervision of the Ministry of Communications, which is responsible for developing and implementing government policy on information and communication. The Superior Council of Communication (SCC), a semiautonomous body under the Office of the President, monitors the content of radio and television programs, newspapers, and Internet <a href="Web%20sites">Web sites</a> to ensure compliance with professional ethics standards and government policy. The SCC may summon journalists and issue warnings for subsequent violations. Hearings may concern alleged libel, disturbing the peace, inciting violence, or violations of state security.

Journalists occasionally face criminal <a href="libel">libel</a> prosecutions and other forms of harassment and intimidation. In addition to the prohibition against insulting the head of state, the law also prohibits the publication of shocking images and lack of respect for the deceased. Although the government does not attempt to impede criticism, some journalists practice <a href="self-censorship">self-censorship</a>.

The Burkinabé government, in its telecommunications development strategy, has stated its aim to make telecommunications a <a href="universal%20service">universal service</a> accessible to all. A large portion of this strategy is the privatization of the National Telecommunications Office (ONATEL), with an additional focus on a rural telephony promotion project. In 2006 the government sold a 51 percent stake in the national telephone company, ONATEL, and ultimately planned to retain only a 23 percent stake in the company.


Radio is the country's most popular communications medium. Dozens of private and community radio stations and a handful of private TV channels operate alongside their state-run counterparts. The <a href="BBC%20World%20Service">BBC World Service</a>, <a href="Voice%20of%20America">Voice of America</a>, and <a href="Radio%20France%20Internationale">Radio France Internationale</a> are all on the air in the capital, <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>.


Use of mobile phones has skyrocketed in the last decade, growing from 2,700 subscribers in 1998, to 1.0 million in 2006, to 10.0 million in 2012. Competition was introduced to the mobile telephone segment in 2000 between operators <a href="Celtel">Celtel</a> (now <a href="Bharti%20Airtel">Bharti Airtel</a>), Télécel Faso (now Moov), and Telmob (ONATEL). This pushed rates down even as density and coverage area increased. Mobile phone users utilize "flashing" which allows extremely low-cost operations and Burkina Faso's ancient oral tradition and <a href="talking%20drum">talking drum</a> culture have harmonized well the introduction of mobile phone technologies. Additionally, mobile phone owners have acquired status by being able to loan their phones to others in their communities.

ONATEL, majority-owned by <a href="Maroc%20Telecom">Maroc Telecom</a>, operates the country’s fixed-line network, a <a href="CDMA2000">CDMA2000</a> wireless network, a fibre optic backbone, and a <a href="GSM">GSM</a> mobile network, Telmob.


Internet use is low, but the sector began to improve following installation of a 22 Mbit/s <a href="fiber%20optic">fiber optic</a> international link, a vast improvement over the previous 128 kbit/s link. Secondary access nodes began to appear in major cities, and <a href="cybercaf%C3%A9">cybercafé</a>s were providing Internet access to a broader spectrum of end users.

ONATEL’s FasoNet is the country’s leading wired Internet service provider, dominating the broadband market with its <a href="ADSL">ADSL</a> and <a href="EV-DO">EV-DO</a> fixed-wireless offerings.

The mobile operators are offering data services using <a href="GPRS">GPRS</a> and <a href="EDGE">EDGE</a> technology, and <a href="3G">third generation</a> (3G) mobile broadband technology was not introduced until 2013 by Bharti Airtel.

A March 2013 ITU "Study on international Internet connectivity in sub-Saharan Africa" reports that the Burkina Faso "Internet market is not sufficiently dynamic and competitive" and that the high costs for Internet capable mobile phones (more than six times the cost of a basic mobile phone) and mobile Internet subscriptions (up to seven times the cost for basic mobile) limit the number of Internet users.

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet; however, the Superior Council of Communication (SCC) monitors Internet <a href="Web%20sites">Web sites</a> and <a href="discussion%20forums">discussion forums</a> to ensure compliance with existing regulations. For example, in May 2012 the SCC issued a warning to a Web site on which a user had allegedly insulted <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">President Compaore</a> in an Internet forum.

The constitution and law provide for <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and of the <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">press</a>, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. The law prohibits persons from insulting the head of state or using derogatory language with respect to the office; however, individuals criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal.

The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice. In cases of national security, however, the law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and private correspondence without a warrant.

Transport in Burkina Faso

Transport in Burkina Faso consists primarily of road, air and rail transportation. <a href="The%20World%20Bank">The World Bank</a> classified country's transportation as underdeveloped but noted that <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> is a natural geographic transportation hub for <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>.

There are a total of of <a href="highway">highway</a> in Burkina Faso, of which are paved.

In 2000, the Government of Burkina Faso classified 15,000 kilometers of road as part of the national road network managed under the Ministry of Infrastructures Transport and Housing (MITH) through the Directorate of Roads (DGR). This network includes main inter-city roads and access roads for départments' capital cities. Only ten of the network's main roads are even partially paved, and the paved roads are plagued by dangerous potholes, missing signage, missing barriers and guardrails near roadside hazards, and no pavement markings to separate traffic moving in opposite directions.

As of May 2011 the country's road infrastructure was rated by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> to be in relatively good condition and noted that country was regional hub with paved roads linking the country to Mali, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, and Niger. Nevertheless, "trucking <a href="cartels">cartels</a> and red tape contribute to high transportation costs and diminished international competitiveness." 58% of firms in Burkina Faso identified roads as major business constraint, maintenance and rehabilitation needs of the main road network are said to be underfunded.

There are international airports at <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a> and <a href="Bobo-Dioulasso">Bobo-Dioulasso</a> and numerous smaller airfields. In 2004, the number of airports totaled 23, only 2 of which had paved runways as of 2005. <a href="Air%20Burkina">Air Burkina</a>, which began in 1967, is government-run and has a monopoly on domestic service but also flies to neighboring countries.

Ouagadougou airport handles about 98% percent of all scheduled commercial air traffic in Burkina Faso. Air Burkina and Air France handle about 60% of all scheduled passenger traffic. Between 2005 and 2011, air passenger traffic at Ouagadougou airport grew at an average annual rate of 7.0 percent per annum reaching about 404,726 passengers in 2011 and was estimated to reach 850,000 by 2025. In 2007 Ouagadougou airport was the fifteenth busiest airport in West Africa in passenger volume, just ahead of Port Harcourt (Nigeria) and behind Banjul (Gambia). The total air cargo at Ouagadougou airport grew 71% from 4,350 tons in 2005 to about 7,448 tons in 2009.

The government plans to close the Ouagadougou airport upon construction of the new <a href="Ouagadougou-Donsin%20Airport">Ouagadougou-Donsin Airport</a>, approximately 35 km northeast of Ouagadougou. The new airport is expected to be completed around 2018 and the government received a $85 million loan from the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> to help finance the construction. The government of Burkino Faso believed that the project would cost $618 million.

There are 622 kilometres of <a href="railway">railway</a> in <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, of which 517 km run from Ouagadougou to Abidjan, <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>; and 105 km from Ouagadougou to Kaya. As of June 2014 "Sitarail" operates a passenger train three times a week along the route from Ouagadougou to Abidjan via <a href="Banfora">Banfora</a>, <a href="Bobo-Dioulasso">Bobo-Dioulasso</a> and <a href="Koudougou">Koudougou</a>.

All of the railways in the country are of . Only <a href="Transport%20in%20Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a> is connected to Burkina Faso by rail.

Instability in Ivory Coast in 2003 forced a rerouting of rail freight from the Abidjan corridor to ports in Togo, Benin, and Ghana via the road network. A proposed rail link between Ouagadougou and <a href="P%C3%B4">Pô</a> in Burkina Faso and <a href="Kumasi">Kumasi</a> and <a href="Boankra">Boankra</a> in Ghana, has been discussed with Ghanaian officials, and feasibility studies are being undertaken to explore this possibility, which would provide rail access to the inland port of Bonakra. Burkina Faso and Ghana use different rail gauges and this <a href="break-of-gauge">break-of-gauge</a> can be overcome to a greater or lesser extent with a number of methods.

In 2006, an Indian proposal surfaced to link the railways in Benin and Togo with landlocked Niger and Burkina Faso. Additionally, a Czech proposal also surfaced to link Ghana railways with Burkina Faso. The manganese deposits near <a href="Dori%2C%20Burkina%20Faso">Dori</a> are one source of traffic. Burkina Faso would also be a participant in the <a href="AfricaRail">AfricaRail</a> project.

In May, 2011 the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> reported that "Sitarail" had recovered well from the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Ivorian%20crisis">political crisis in Ivory Coast</a> but was experiencing financial distress, needed to re-balance its financial structure and find alternative funding for rehabilitation backlog.

The following towns of Burkina Faso are served by the country's railways:

Military of Burkina Faso

The branches of <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>'s military include its Army, Air Force, National Gendarmerie, National Police, and <a href="People%27s%20Militia%20%28Burkina%20Faso%29">People's Militia</a>. Being a landlocked country, Burkina Faso has no <a href="navy">navy</a>.

In 1966 a <a href="military%20coup">military coup</a> deposed the first president of <a href="Republic%20of%20Upper%20Volta">Upper Volta</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Yam%C3%A9ogo">Maurice Yaméogo</a>, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Sangoul%C3%A9%20Lamizana">Sangoulé Lamizana</a> at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for 4 years; on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a 4-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions and on November 25, 1980, Colonel <a href="Saye%20Zerbo">Saye Zerbo</a> overthrew President Lamizana in a bloodless coup. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later on November 7, 1982, by Major Dr. <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Ou%C3%A9draogo">Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo</a> and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.

Factional infighting developed between moderates in the CSP and radicals led by Captain <a href="Thomas%20Sankara">Thomas Sankara</a>, who was appointed prime minister in January 1983. The internal political struggle and Sankara's leftist rhetoric led to his arrest and subsequent efforts to bring about his release, directed by Captain <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Blaise Compaoré</a>. This release effort resulted in yet another military coup d'état on August 4, 1983. Compaoré came to power in a 1987 coup that led to the death of Sankara.

On February 15, 2011, <a href="2011%20Burkinab%C3%A9%20protests">soldiers mutinied</a> in <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a> over unpaid housing allowances. On April 18, 2011, it was reported that the mutiny had spread to <a href="Kaya%2C%20Burkina%20Faso">Kaya</a> after demonstrations in <a href="P%C3%B4">Pô</a> and <a href="Tenkodogo">Tenkodogo</a>. On April 29, 2011, the army said the mutiny would end after Compaoré promised to improve the military's housing, clothing and food allowances, though there were later protests by soldiers.

After <a href="2015%20Burkinabe%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">a coup</a> by members of the <a href="Regiment%20of%20Presidential%20Security">Regiment of Presidential Security</a> on September 16, 2015, Army units marched on Ouagadougou to oppose the coup, resulting in the restoration of Burkina Faso's transitional government (which was appointed after the <a href="2014%20Burkinabe%20uprising">2014 Burkinabe uprising</a>) on September 23, 2015.

The Army of Burkina Faso ("L'Armée de Terre" – Ground Forces or LAT) is a skeletonized force structure of some 5,800–6,000 officers and men, augmented by a conscript force or "<a href="People%27s%20Militia%20%28Burkina%20Faso%29">People's Militia</a>" of some 45,000 men and women. Unlike the police and security forces, the Army and the People's Militia are organized along Soviet/Chinese models and precepts. The Army is equipped with light wheeled armored cars, some mounting cannon.

The IISS estimated in 2011–12 that Burkina Faso had 6,400 personnel in the "Armee de Terre" in three military regions, one tank battalion (two tank platoons), five infantry regiments that may be under-strength, and an airborne regiment. Artillery and engineer battalions are also listed.

In recent years, the United States has begun providing military assistance and training to Burkina Faso's ground forces. It has trained three 750-man battalions for peace support operations in Darfur. During a recent UN inspection, a <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a> evaluation team found Burkina's "Laafi" battalion fit to deploy to Sudan. Using a small Department of Defense International Military Education and Training (IMET) budget, the U.S. Embassy has established English-language courses at an LAT military base, and has brought LAT officers to attend officer basic training courses in the U.S. The government of Burkina Faso has also accepted additional U.S. training assistance in counter-terrorism tactics and humanitarian assistance. Burkina Faso has recently become a member of the <a href="Trans-Saharan%20Counterterrorism%20Initiative">Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership</a> (TSCTP).






The Air Force was founded in 1964 as the "Escadrille de la République de Haute-Volta" (EHV) or the Republic of Upper Volta Air Squadron, a subordinate unit of the Army. That year, a transient air support base was created with the assistance of the <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a>. After acquiring an initial fleet of utility and transport aircraft, the squadron was attached to an inter-army support regiment. In 1970, the "Escadrille" was renamed the "Force Aérienne de Haute-Volta", or FAHV, and in 1977 became an autonomous force. In October 1985, the "Force Aérienne de Burkina Faso", or FABF, was officially inaugurated.

The EHV was initially formed with two <a href="Douglas%20C-47">Douglas C-47</a> Skytrain and three <a href="Max%20Holste%20Broussard">MH.1521M Broussard</a> aircraft. These were later followed by two <a href="A%C3%A9rospatiale%20Alouette%20III">Alouette III SA.316 B</a> helicopters, used mostly for liaison purposes, one twin-engined <a href="Aero%20Commander%20500%20family">Aero Commander 500</a> light utility aircraft, two <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20HS%20748">Hawker-Siddeley HS.748-2A</a> twin turboprop transport aircraft, and two <a href="A%C3%A9rospatiale%20N%20262">Nord 262</a> twin turboprop transport aircraft. Two "escadrilles" (squadrons) or sub-formations were created: the "Escadrille de Transport" (Transport Unit), and the "Escadrille d'Hélicoptères" (Helicopter Unit). Later, the "Escadrille d'Entraînement" (Training Unit) was added. All squadrons were initially based at Ouagadougou.

In mid-1984, Libyan military aid brought eight <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-21">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21</a> jet fighters, along with two MiG-21U combat trainer versions. These ex-Libyan Air Force MiG-21 'Fishbed' fighters were based in <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a>, although they were actually operated by the Libyan Air Force on loan by Libya, and were removed in 1985 without seeing combat. A single MiG-17F Fresco that was also operated by the FABF did see combat service in the <a href="Agacher%20Strip%20War">Agacher Strip War</a> in 1985–86.
In 1985, the FABF also acquired two ex-Soviet <a href="Mil%20Mi-4">Mi-4</a> transport helicopters from an unknown supplier, followed by an additional two Mi-4s. The Mi-4s were operated by the FABF until the late 1980s, when they were taken out of service. Five <a href="Mil%20Mi-8">Mi-8</a>/17 transport helicopters were later added to the "Escadrille d'Hélicoptères". While supervising the ceasefire after the <a href="Agacher%20Strip%20War">Agacher Strip War</a>, an FABF SA.316B Alouette III crashed at Kouni on 14 January 1986, leaving only one SA.316B still in service with the "Escadrille d'Hélicoptères".

In 1986, the FABF formed a new unit, the "Escadrille de Chasse" (EdC) (Attack Unit). In mid-1986 six ex-Philippine Air Force <a href="Aermacchi%20SF.260">SF.260WP Warrior</a> armed trainers/light strike aircraft were acquired from a dealer in Belgium, which offered the FABF a much simpler and less expensive alternative in tactical air support to the expensive MiGs. The Warriors were not only used for pilot training, but also as light strike aircraft, and a number of them were employed by the FABF's "Escadrille de Chasse" (EdC). Four additional SF.260WPs were subsequently bought directly from Italy. The six ex-Philippine SF.260WP aircraft were taken out of service in 1993 and returned to their previous owner, although the four newly built SF.260WP aircraft were retained in service, and stationed at Bobo Dioulasso air base.

Most of the other light aircraft acquired by the FABF in the 1970s and 1980s have also now been retired along with the Mi-4 helicopters, but some recent acquisitions have been made, including a <a href="Beech%20Aircraft">Beechcraft</a> "<a href="Beechcraft%20King%20Air">King Air</a>", a Piper <a href="Piper%20PA-34%20Seneca">PA-34 "Seneca"</a>, a <a href="Apex%20Aircraft">CEAPR</a> "Robin" light training aircraft, and a single <a href="Air%20Tractor">Air Tractor</a> "<a href="Air%20Tractor%20AT-802">AT-802</a>" aerial sprayer aircraft for spraying insecticides, purchased after the northern part of the country suffered heavy crop damage from a 2004 invasion of swarming <a href="Migratory%20locust">locusts</a>. In 2009, two Xenon Gyroplane autogyros were purchased for use by police and security forces.

In late 2005, the FABF acquired two <a href="Mil%20Mi-35">Mil Mi-35</a> 'Hind' attack helicopters from Russia in apparent response by moves by neighbouring <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a> to bolster its own air attack capabilities during the <a href="First%20Ivorian%20Civil%20War">Ivorian Civil War</a>.

Foreign relations of Burkina Faso

<a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> has good relations with the European Union, African and Asian countries. France, the former colonial power, in particular, continues to provide significant aid and supports <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Compaoré's</a> developing role as a regional powerbroker. Burkina maintains diplomatic relations with the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a> (usually referred to as "<a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>") instead of the People's Republic of China.

According to the U.S. State Department, "<a href="Burkina%20Faso-United%20States%20relations">U.S. relations with Burkina Faso</a> are good but subject to strains in the past because of the Compaoré government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity." 

Burkina Faso's relations with its West African neighbors have improved in recent years. Relations with <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, in particular, have warmed with a change in government in that country. President Compaoré has mediated a political crisis in <a href="Togo">Togo</a> and helped to resolve the <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg</a> conflict in <a href="Niger">Niger</a>. Burkina maintains cordial relations with <a href="Libya">Libya</a>. A territorial dispute with <a href="Mali">Mali</a> was mediated by Ghana and <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, which has led to lessening of tensions between the two nations.

Nineteen provinces of Burkina Faso are joined with contiguous areas of Mali and Niger under the <a href="Liptako-Gourma%20Authority">Liptako-Gourma Authority</a>, a regional economic organization.

Burkina Faso is also a member of the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Court">International Criminal Court</a> with a bilateral immunity agreement of protection for the United States-military (as covered under <a href="Rome%20Statute%20of%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court">Article 98</a>).

Both countries established diplomatic relations on 25 November 1992.

In September 2007, <a href="Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) intervened to attempt to resolve the dispute over two villages along the <a href="Benin">Benin</a>–Burkina Faso border that remain from a 2005 ICJ decision.

When <a href="Thomas%20Sankara">Thomas Sankara</a> came to power in 1983 relations between Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast became hostile as <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny">Félix Houphouët-Boigny</a> was threatened by Sankara's revolutionary regime. That was one of the main reasons why <a href="Blaise%20Compaore">Blaise Compaore</a> launched his coup in 1987 killing Sankara and making himself president. Under <a href="Blaise%20Compaore">Blaise Compaore</a> Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso reestablished good relations and both countries supported <a href="Charles%20Taylor%20%28Liberian%20politician%29">Charles Taylor</a>'s <a href="NPFL">NPFL</a> in their overthrow of <a href="Samuel%20Doe">Samuel Doe</a>. They remain allies and are active trading partners. 

With the coming to power of <a href="Thomas%20Sankara">Thomas Sankara</a> in Burkina Faso in 1983, relations between <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> and Burkina became both warm and close. Indeed, <a href="Jerry%20Rawlings">Rawlings</a> and Sankara began discussions about uniting Ghana and Burkina in the manner of the defunct <a href="Ghana-Guinea-Mali%20Union">Ghana-Guinea-Mali Union</a>, which Nkrumah had sought unsuccessfully to promote as a foundation for his dream of unified continental government. Political and economic ties between Ghana and Burkina, a poorer country, were strengthened through joint commissions of cooperation and through border demarcation committee meetings. Frequent high-level consultations and joint military exercises, meant to discourage potential dissidents and to protect young "revolutions" in each country, were fairly regular features of Ghana-Burkina relations.

Burkina Faso recognised the <a href="Republic%20of%20Kosovo">Republic of Kosovo</a> on April 24, 2008. Burkina Faso and Kosovo established diplomatic relations on December 6, 2012.

India and Burkina Faso enjoy warm relations.

Diplomatic relations between Burkina Faso and the Soviet Union were established for the first time on February 18, 1967. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Burkina Faso recognized Russia as the USSR's successor. However financial reasons has shut the embassies between the two nations. In 1992, the embassy of the Russian Federation in <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a> was closed, and in 1996, the embassy of Burkina Faso in Moscow was closed.

Establishment of diplomatic relations was on April 20, 1962, with visits in 1981 by Special Envoy of the President <a href="Roh%20Tae-woo">Roh Tae-woo</a>, in 1983 by Park Chan-geung and in 1984 by Kang Kyung-shik.

Sweden is a major contributor of developmental aid to Burkina Faso. The <a href="Burkina%20Faso%E2%80%93Sweden%20Friendship%20Association">Burkina Faso–Sweden Friendship Association</a> was formed in 1986 to promote exchange between the two countries.

Relations are good but subject to strains in the past because of the <a href="Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9">Compaoré</a> government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity. In addition to regional peace and stability, U.S. interests in Burkina are to promote continued <a href="democratization">democratization</a> and greater respect for human rights and to encourage sustainable economic development. Although the <a href="Agency%20for%20International%20Development">Agency for International Development</a> (USAID) closed its office in <a href="Ouagadougou">Ouagadougou</a> in 1995, about $18 million annually of USAID funding goes to Burkina's development through non-governmental and regional organizations.

The political landscape of Burundi has been dominated in recent years by the <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a> and a long <a href="Peacebuilding">peace process</a> and move to <a href="democracy">democracy</a>. The current <a href="President%20of%20Burundi">President of Burundi</a> is <a href="Pierre%20Nkurunziza">Pierre Nkurunziza</a>, a former rebel leader of the <a href="Hutu">Hutu</a> <a href="National%20Council%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20Democracy-Forces%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20Democracy">National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy</a> who was <a href="Burundian%20presidential%20election%2C%202005">elected unopposed</a> as the new <a href="Rulers%20and%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Burundi">President of Burundi</a> by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Burundi">parliament</a> on 19 August 2005. Nkurunziza was the first president chosen through democratic means since the start of the <a href="Burundi%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> in 1993 and was sworn in on 26 August, replacing transitional president <a href="Domitien%20Ndayizeye">Domitien Ndayizeye</a>.

In November 1995, the presidents of <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>, <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, and <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a> (currently <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>) announced a regional initiative for a negotiated peace in Burundi facilitated by former Tanzanian President <a href="Julius%20Nyerere">Julius Nyerere</a>. In July 1996, former Burundian President <a href="Pierre%20Buyoya">Buyoya</a> returned to power in a <a href="1996%20Burundian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">bloodless coup</a>. He declared himself president of a transitional republic, even as he suspended the National Assembly, banned opposition groups, and imposed a nationwide curfew. Widespread condemnation of the coup ensued, and regional countries imposed economic sanctions pending a return to a constitutional government. Buyoya agreed in 1996 to liberalize political parties. Nonetheless, fighting between the army and <a href="Hutu">Hutu</a> militias continued. In June 1998, Buyoya promulgated a transitional constitution and announced a partnership between the government and the opposition-led National Assembly. After facilitator Julius Nyerere's death in October 1999, the regional leaders appointed <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> as <a href="Facilitator">Facilitator</a> of the <a href="Arusha">Arusha</a> peace process. Under Mandela the peace process has revived and important progress has taken place.

In April 2015 the <a href="2015%20Burundian%20unrest">2015 Burundian unrest</a> broke out after the ruling party announced President <a href="Pierre%20Nkurunziza">Pierre Nkurunziza</a> would seek a third term in office. Protests in the capital lasted over a week, and while President Nkurunziza was in Tanzania for talks at resolving the situation, Major General <a href="Godefroid%20Niyombare">Godefroid Niyombare</a> declared a coup, leading to gun battles in the capital for control of key locations.

The president is elected by the people. He nominates two vice-presidents, who form together with the <a href="Ministers%20of%20the%20Burundian%20Government">Council of Ministers</a> the executive branch.

Economy of Burundi

<a href="Burundi">Burundi</a> is a <a href="Landlocked%20country">landlocked</a>, resource-poor country with an underdeveloped <a href="manufacturing">manufacturing</a> sector. The mainstay of the Burundian economy is <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, accounting for 54% of <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> in 1997. Agriculture supports more than 70% of the labour force, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers. Although Burundi is potentially self-sufficient in food production, the ongoing civil war, <a href="Human%20overpopulation">overpopulation</a>, and <a href="soil%20erosion">soil erosion</a> have contributed to the contraction of the <a href="subsistence%20economy">subsistence economy</a> by 25% in recent years. Large numbers of <a href="internally%20displaced%20person">internally displaced person</a>s have been unable to produce their own food and are largely dependent on international humanitarian assistance. Burundi is a net food importer, with food accounting for 17% of imports in 1997.

Little industry exists except the processing of agricultural exports. Although potential wealth in <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, and other natural resources is being explored, the uncertain security situation has prevented meaningful investor interest. Industrial development also is hampered by Burundi's distance from the sea and high transport costs. <a href="Lake%20Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a> remains an important trading point. The trade <a href="embargo">embargo</a>, lifted in 1999, negatively impacted trade and industry. Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 people and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in short supply.

Burundi is heavily dependent on bilateral and multilateral aid, with external debt totalling $1.247 <a href="1000000000%20%28number%29">billion</a> (1.247 G$) in 1997. A series of largely unsuccessful 5-year plans initiated in July 1986 in partnership with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund attempted to reform the foreign exchange system, liberalize imports, reduce restrictions on international transactions, diversify exports, and reform the coffee industry.

IMF structural adjustment programs in Burundi were suspended following the outbreak of the crisis in 1993. The World Bank has identified key areas for potential growth, including the productivity of traditional crops and the introduction of new exports, light manufactures, industrial mining, and services. Other serious problems include the state's role in the economy, the question of governmental transparency, and debt reduction.

To protest the <a href="1996%20Burundian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1996 coup</a> by President <a href="Pierre%20Buyoya">Pierre Buyoya</a>, neighbouring countries imposed an economic embargo on Burundi. Although the embargo was never officially ratified by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, most countries refrained from official trade with Burundi. Following the coup, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> also suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burundi. The regional embargo was lifted on January 23, 1999, based on progress by the government in advancing national reconciliation through the Burundi peace process.

In an article titled "The Blood Cries Out," "<a href="Foreign%20Policy">Foreign Policy</a> (FP)" reported that the Burundi <a href="population%20growth%20rate">population growth rate</a> is 2.5 percent per year, more than double the average global pace, and the a Burundian woman has on average 6.3 children, nearly triple the international <a href="fertility%20rate">fertility rate</a>. "FP" further reported that "The vast majority of Burundians rely on subsistence farming, but under the weight of a booming population and in the long-standing absence of coherent policies governing land ownership, many people barely have enough earth to sustain themselves." In 2014, the average size for a farm was about one acre. "FP" added that "The consequence is remarkable scarcity: In the 2013 Global Hunger Index, Burundi had the severest hunger and malnourishment rates of all 120 countries ranked."

Transport in Burundi

There are a number of systems of transport in Burundi, including road and water-based infrastructure, the latter of which makes use of <a href="Lake%20Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a>. Furthermore, there are also some airports in <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>.

A great hindrance to Burundi’s economic development is lack of adequate transportation. The country has limited ferry services on Lake Tanganyika, few road connections to neighboring countries, no rail connections, and only one airport with a paved runway. Public transport is extremely limited and private bus companies operate buses on the route to Kigali but not to Tanzania or the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Roads total as of 2004, and only about 7 percent of them are paved and remain open in all weather; the rest are classed as local roads or tracks. In 2003, there were 24,000 passenger cars and 23,500 commercial vehicles. On paper there are 90 public buses in the country but few of these are operational. Transport is extremely limited and private bus companies operate buses on the route to Kigali but not to Tanzania or the Democratic Republic of Congo.

<a href="Lake%20Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a> is used for transport, with the major <a href="port">port</a> on the lake being <a href="Bujumbura">Bujumbura</a>. Most freight is transported down waterways.

Military of Burundi

The National Defence Force is the <a href="Armed%20forces">state military organisation</a> responsible for the defence of <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>.
A general staff ("État-Major Général") commands the armed forces, consisting of a joint staff ("État-Major inter-armes"); a training staff ("État-Major de la Formation"), and a logistics staff ("État-Major de la Logistique"). Naval and aviation 
commands exist, as well as specialised units.

Burundi gained independence in July 1962. In October 1965, an attempted <a href="1965%20Burundian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> led by the Hutu-dominated police was carried out but failed. The Tutsi dominated army, then led by Tutsi officer Captain <a href="Michel%20Micombero">Michel Micombero</a> purged Hutu from their ranks and carried out reprisal attacks which ultimately claimed the lives of up to 5,000 people in a predecessor to the <a href="Burundian%20Genocide">1972 Burundian Genocide</a>. Micombero then became Prime Minister.

King Mwambutsa, who had fled the country during the October coup of 1965, was deposed by a <a href="July%201966%20Burundian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup in July 1966</a> and his teenage son, <a href="Ntare%20V%20of%20Burundi">Prince Ntare V</a>, claimed the throne. Later that same year, Prime Minister, then-Captain, Michel Micombero, carried out another <a href="November%201966%20Burundian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup in November, 1966</a>, this time deposing Ntare, abolishing the monarchy and declaring the nation a <a href="republic">republic</a>. His one-party government was effectively a <a href="military%20dictatorship">military dictatorship</a>. As president, Micombero became an advocate of <a href="African%20socialism">African socialism</a> and received support from the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a>. He imposed a staunch regime of law and order and sharply repressed Hutu militarism. After Micombero's <a href="coup%20d%E2%80%99etat">coup d’etat</a> which deposed the monarchy, he became first general in Burundian history. He was also commissioned by the National Council of the Revolution (French: Conseil National de la Révolution (CNR)), and made a Lieutenant Général. In his turn, Micombero raised <a href="Thomas%20Ndabemeye">Thomas Ndabemeye</a> to the grade of Major General. They were the sole generals of the First Republic.

In 1981-82 the IISS estimated that the Burundian armed forces were 6,000 strong, with 2 infantry battalions, 1 airborne battalion, 1 commando battalion, and an armoured car company. The same estimate was repeated in the 1988-89 edition except that the strength figure had been dropped to 5,500.

The Burundian Civil War lasted from 1993 to 2005, and an estimated 300,000 people were killed. The <a href="Arusha%20Peace%20and%20Reconciliation%20Agreement%20for%20Burundi">Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi</a> ended 12 years of war and stopped decades of ethnic killings. The <a href="Burundian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202005">2005 constitution</a> provided guaranteed representation for both <a href="Hutu">Hutu</a> and <a href="Tutsi">Tutsi</a>, and <a href="Burundian%20legislative%20election%2C%202005">2005 parliamentary elections</a> that led to Pierre Nkurunziza, from the Hutu <a href="National%20Council%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20Democracy%20%E2%80%93%20Forces%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20Democracy">FDD</a>, becoming President.

According to a 2004 report by Child Soldiers International, Burundi's military used conscripted child soldiers. Children in military service were subject to military courts which fell short of international law standards.

The armed forces have deployed significant numbers of troops to the <a href="African%20Union%20Mission%20in%20Somalia">African Union Mission in Somalia</a> since c. 2007. On February 1, 2007 <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a> committed to the mission, pledging up to 1,000 troops. By March 27, it was confirmed that 1700 Burundian troops would be sent to Somalia. In 2011 the IISS estimated that three Burundian battalions were deployed there. The army's forces in 2011 included, according to IISS estimates, 2 light armoured battalions (squadrons), seven infantry battalions and independent companies; and artillery, engineer, and air defence battalions (SA-7 'Grail' man-portable SAMs and 14.5mm, 23mm and 37mm guns were reported). Separately reported were the 22nd commando battalion (<a href="Gitega%20Province">Gitega</a>) and 124th commando battalion <a href="Bujumbura">Bujumbura</a>).

In the wake of the <a href="Burundian%20unrest">Burundian unrest</a>, personnel faced a choice between supporting President <a href="Pierre%20Nkurunziza">Pierre Nkurunziza</a>, with whom some fought when he was a military commander, or opposing him. Interviewed by <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> on May 14, 2015, an Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft said moves by Major General <a href="Godefroid%20Niyombare">Godefroid Niyombare</a>, former director of the intelligence service, "starkly highlight[ed] Nkurunziza’s lack of unified support among his military chiefs," he said. "Even if Niyombare’s attempt fails, Nkurunziza’s political credibility may be damaged irreparably."

In the aftermath of the coup and the later disputed election, armed forces chief of staff Major General <a href="Prime%20Niyongabo">Prime Niyongabo</a> survived an assassination attempt on September 11, 2015.

Bosphorus

The Bosphorus ( or ) or Bosporus (; , "Bósporos"; , ) is a narrow, natural <a href="strait">strait</a> and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. It forms part of the continental boundary between <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, and separates <a href="Anatolia">Asian Turkey</a> from <a href="East%20Thrace">European Turkey</a>. The world's narrowest strait used for <a href="International%20waterway">international navigation</a>, the Bosphorus connects the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> with the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>, and, by extension via the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>, the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>s.

Most of the shores of the strait are heavily settled, straddled by the city of <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>'s <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan</a> <a href="population">population</a> of 17 million inhabitants extending inland from both coasts.

Together with the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>, the Bosphorus forms the <a href="Turkish%20Straits">Turkish Straits</a>.

The original name of the channel comes from an <a href="Anglicisation">Anglicisation</a> of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> ("Bosporos"), which was folk-etymologised as , i.e. "cattle strait" (or "<a href="Oxford">Ox-ford</a>"), from the genitive of "bous" "ox, cattle" + "poros" "passage", thus meaning "cattle-passage", or "cow passage". This is in reference to the <a href="Greek%20mythology">mythological story</a> of <a href="Io%20%28mythology%29">Io</a>, who was transformed into a cow, and was subsequently condemned to wander the Earth until she crossed the Bosphorus, where she met the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>, who comforted her with the information that she would be restored to human form by <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and become the ancestress of the greatest of all heroes, <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> (Hercules).

This folk etymology was canonized by <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> in "<a href="Prometheus%20Bound">Prometheus Bound</a>" (v. 734f.), where Prometheus prophesies to Io that the strait would be named after her.
The site where Io supposedly went ashore was near <a href="%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar%23Chrysopolis">Chrysopolis</a> (present-day <a href="%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar">Üsküdar</a>), and was named "Bous" "the Cow". The same site was also known as "Damalis", as it was where the Athenian general <a href="Chares%20of%20Athens">Chares</a> had erected a monument to his wife Damalis, which included a colossal statue of a cow (the name "Damalis" translating to "calf").

The spelling with "-ph-", as "Bosphorus", has no justification in the ancient Greek name, but it occurs as a variant in <a href="medieval%20Latin">medieval Latin</a> (as "Bosphorus", and occasionally "Bosforus, Bosferus"), and in <a href="medieval%20Greek">medieval Greek</a> sometimes as Βόσφορος,
giving rise to the French form "Bosphore", Spanish "Bósforo" and Russian Босфор.
The 12th century Greek scholar <a href="John%20Tzetzes">John Tzetzes</a> calls it " Damaliten Bosporon" (after "Damalis"), but he also reports that in popular usage the strait was known as "Prosphorion" during his day, the name of <a href="Prosphorion%20Harbour">the most ancient northern harbour</a> of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.

Historically, the Bosphorus was also known as the "Strait of Constantinople", or the <a href="Thrace">Thracian</a> Bosphorus, in order to distinguish it from the <a href="Cimmerian%20Bosporus">Cimmerian Bosporus</a> in <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>. These are expressed in <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>' <a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">"Histories"</a>, 4.83; as "Bosporus Thracius, Bosporus Thraciae ", and , respectively. Other names by which the strait is referenced by Herodotus include <a href="Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a>ian Bosporus ("Bosporus Chalcedoniae", , Herodotus 4.87), or <a href="Mysia">Mysia</a>n Bosporus ("Bosporus Mysius").

The term eventually <a href="Generic%20trademark%23Trademark%20erosion">came to be used as common noun</a> βόσπορος, meaning "a strait", and was also formerly applied to the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a> in <a href="Classical%20Greek">Classical Greek</a> by <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> and <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>.

Presently, the waterway is officially referred to as simply "Bosphorus" (), the "Strait of <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>", or "Istanbul Strait" ().

As a <a href="wikt%3Amaritime">maritime</a> <a href="waterway">waterway</a>, the Bosphorus connects various seas along the <a href="Eastern%20Mediterranean">Eastern Mediterranean</a>, the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>, and <a href="Western%20Eurasia">Western Eurasia</a>, and specifically connects the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> to the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>. The Marmara further connects to the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>s via the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>. Thus, the Bosphorus allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and the Indian Ocean through the Suez Canal, making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming in from <a href="Russia">Russia</a>.

A common mistake made by those who are unfamiliar with the locale is to assume the Bosphorus is a <a href="river">river</a>, when it is, in fact, a narrow sea channel.

The exact scientific cause and date of the formation of the Bosphorus remain the subject of debate among geologists. One recent theory, dubbed The <a href="Black%20Sea%20deluge%20theory">Black Sea deluge theory</a>, which was launched by a study of the same name in 1997 by two scientists from <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, postulates that the Bosphorus was formed around 5600 BC when the rising waters of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a> breached through to the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, which at the time, according to the theory, was a low-lying body of fresh water.

Many geologists, however, claim that the strait is much older, even if relatively young on a geologic timescale.

From the perspective of <a href="ancient%20Greek%20mythology">ancient Greek mythology</a>, it was said that colossal floating rocks known as the <a href="Symplegades">Symplegades</a>, or Clashing Rocks, once occupied the hilltops on both sides of the Bosphorus, and destroyed any ship that attempted passage of the channel by rolling down the strait's hills and violently crushing all vessels between them. The Symplegades were defeated when the lyrical hero <a href="Jason">Jason</a> obtained successful passage, whereupon the rocks became fixed, and Greek access to the Black Sea was opened.

The limits of the Bosphorus are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses of <a href="Rumeli%20Feneri">Rumeli Feneri</a> and <a href="Anadolu%20Feneri">Anadolu Feneri</a> in the north, and between the <a href="Ah%C4%B1rkap%C4%B1%20Feneri">Ahırkapı Feneri</a> and the <a href="Kad%C4%B1k%C3%B6y%20%C4%B0nciburnu%20Feneri">Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri</a> in the south. Between these limits, the strait is long, with a width of at the northern entrance and at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is between Umuryeri and Büyükdere Limanı, and minimum width between <a href="Kandilli%2C%20%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar">Kandilli Point</a> and <a href="A%C5%9Fiyan">Aşiyan</a>.

The depth of the Bosphorus varies from in midstream with an average of . The deepest location is between Kandilli and <a href="Bebek%2C%20Istanbul">Bebek</a> with . The most shallow locations are off Kadıköy İnciburnu on the northward route with and off Aşiyan Point on the southward route with .

The <a href="Golden%20Horn">Golden Horn</a> is an <a href="estuary">estuary</a> off the main strait that historically acted as a moat to protect Old Istanbul from attack, as well as providing a sheltered anchorage for the imperial navies of various empires until the 19th century, after which it became a historic neighborhood at the heart of the city, popular with tourists and locals alike.

It had been known since before the 20th century that the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara flow into each other in a geographic example of "density flow", and in August 2010, a continuous 'underwater channel' of <a href="suspension%20%28chemistry%29">suspension</a> composition was discovered to flow along the floor of the Bosphorus, which would be the sixth largest river on Earth if it were to be on land. The study of the <a href="water%20erosion">water</a> and <a href="wind%20erosion">wind erosion</a> of the straits relates to that of its formation. Sections of the shore have been reinforced with concrete or rubble and sections of the strait prone to <a href="deposition%20%28geology%29">deposition</a> are periodically dredged.

The 2010 team of scientists, led by the <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">University of Leeds</a>, used a robotic "yellow submarine" to observe detailed flows within an "undersea river", scientifically referred to as a <a href="submarine%20channel">submarine channel</a>, for the first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents—underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits. These deposits ultimately hold not only untapped reserves of gas and oil, they also house important secrets—from clues on past climate change to the ways in which mountains were formed.

The team studied the detailed flow within these channels and findings included:
The central tenet of the <a href="Black%20Sea%20deluge%20hypothesis">Black Sea deluge hypothesis</a> is that as the ocean rose at the end of the last Ice Age when the massive ice sheets melted, the sealed Bosphorus was overtopped in a spectacular flood that increased the then fresh water Black Sea Lake 50%, and drove people from the shores for many months. This was proven by undersea explorer <a href="Robert%20Ballard">Robert Ballard</a>, who discovered settlements along the old shoreline; scientists dated the <a href="flood">flood</a> to 7500 BP or 5500 BC from fresh-salt water microflora. The peoples driven out by the constantly rising water, which must have been terrifying and inexplicable, spread to all corners of the Western world carrying the story of the Great Flood, how it probably entered most religions. As the waters surged, they scoured a network of sea-floor channels less resistant to denser suspended solids in liquid, which remains a very active layer today.

The first images of these submarine channels were obtained in 1999, showing them to be of great size during a <a href="NATO">NATO</a> SACLANT Undersea Research project using jointly the NATO RV "Alliance", and the <a href="Turkish%20Navy">Turkish Navy</a> survey ship "Çubuklu". In 2002, a survey was carried out on board the Ifremer RV "Le Suroit" for BlaSON project (Lericolais, et al., 2003) completed the multibeam mapping of this underwater channel fan-delta. A complete map was published in 2009 using these previous results with high quality mapping obtained in 2006 (by researchers at Memorial University, Newfoundland, Canada who are project partners in this study.)

The team will use the data obtained to create innovative computer simulations that can be used to model how sediment flows through these channels. The models the team will produce will have broad applications, including inputting into the design of seafloor engineering by oil and gas companies.

The project was led by Dr. Jeff Peakall and Dr. Daniel Parsons at the <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">University of Leeds</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="University%20of%20Southampton">University of Southampton</a>, <a href="Memorial%20University">Memorial University</a> (Newfoundland, Canada), and the Institute of Marine Sciences (Izmir, Turkey). The survey was run and coordinated from the Institute of Marine Sciences research ship, the <a href="RV%20K.%20Piri%20Reis">R/V "Koca Piri Reis"</a>.

The researchers estimate that the river, known as a submarine channel, would be the sixth largest river in the world if it were on land based on the amount of water flowing through it.

As part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosphorus has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Control over it has been an objective of a number of conflicts in modern history, notably the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%9378%29">Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)</a>, as well as of the attack of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied Powers</a> on the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> during the 1915 <a href="Battle%20of%20Gallipoli">Battle of Gallipoli</a> in the course of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

The strategic importance of the Bosphorus dates back millennia. The Greek city-state of <a href="Athens">Athens</a> in the 5th century BC, which was dependent on grain imports from <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>, maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the <a href="Megara">Megarian</a> colony <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>.

Persian King <a href="Darius%20I">Darius I</a> the Great, in an attempt to subdue the <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>n horsemen who roamed across the north of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, crossed through the Bosphorus, then marched towards the <a href="River%20Danube">River Danube</a>. His army crossed the Bosphorus over an enormous bridge made by connecting <a href="Achaemenid">Achaemenid</a> boats. This bridge essentially connected the farthest geographic tip of Asia to Europe, encompassing at least some 1,000 metres of open water if not more. Years later, a similar <a href="Xerxes%27%20Pontoon%20Bridges">boat bridge</a> would be constructed by <a href="Xerxes%20I">Xerxes I</a> on the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> (<a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>) strait, during his <a href="Second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece">invasion of Greece</a>.

<a href="Byzantine%20Empire">The Byzantines</a> called the Bosphorus "Stenon" and most important toponyms of it Bosporios Akra, Argyropolis, St. Mamas, St. Phokas, Hestiai or Michaelion, Phoneus, Anaplous or Sosthenion in European side and Hieron tower, Eirenaion, Anthemiou, Sophianai, Bithynian Chryspolis in Asian side in this era 

The strategic significance of the strait was one of the factors in the decision of the Roman Emperor <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine</a> the Great to found there in AD 330 his new capital, <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, which came to be known as the capital of the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>. The phrase "swim the Bosphorus" or "crossing the Bosphorus" was, and is still used to indicate religious conversion to the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>.

On 29 May 1453, the then-emergent <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">conquered</a> the city of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> following a lengthy campaign wherein the Ottomans constructed fortifications on each side of the strait, the <a href="Anadoluhisar%C4%B1">Anadoluhisarı</a> (1393) and the <a href="Rumelihisar%C4%B1">Rumelihisarı</a> (1451), in preparation for not only the primary battle but to assert long-term control over the Bosphorus and surrounding waterways. The final 53-day campaign, which resulted in Ottoman victory, constituted an important turn in world history. Together with <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>'s first voyage to the Americas in 1492, the 1453 conquest of Constantinople is commonly noted as among <a href="Middle%20Ages%23Terminology%20and%20periodisation">the events that brought an end to the Middle Ages</a> and marked the transition to the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and the <a href="Age%20of%20Discovery">Age of Discovery</a>.

The event also marked the end of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a> —the final remnants of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>— and the transfer of the control of the Bosphorus into Ottoman hands, who made Constantinople their new capital, and from where they expanded their empire in the centuries that followed.

At its peak between the 16th and 18th centuries, the Ottoman Empire had used the strategic importance of the Bosphorus to expand their regional ambitions and to wrest control of the entire <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> area, which they regarded as an "Ottoman lake", on which Russian warships were prohibited.

Subsequently, several international treaties have governed vessels using the waters. Under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20H%C3%BCnk%C3%A2r%20%C4%B0skelesi">Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi</a> of 8 July 1833, the Bosporus and <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> straits were to be closed on Russian demand to naval vessels of other powers. By the terms of the <a href="London%20Straits%20Convention">London Straits Convention</a> concluded on 13 July 1841, between the <a href="Great%20Powers">Great Powers</a> of <a href="Europe">Europe</a> — <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>, the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Second%20French%20Republic">France</a>, <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> — the "ancient rule" of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> was re-established by closing the Turkish Straits to any and all <a href="warship">warship</a>s, barring those of the <a href="List%20of%20sultans%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Sultan</a>'s allies during wartime. It thus benefited <a href="Royal%20Navy">British naval</a> power at the expense of Russian, as the latter lacked direct access for its <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">navy</a> to the Mediterranean.

Following the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the 1920 <a href="Treaty%20of%20S%C3%A8vres">Treaty of Sèvres</a> demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>.

This was amended under the 1923 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a>, which restored the straits to Turkish territory—but allowed all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely. Turkey eventually rejected the terms of that treaty, and subsequently Turkey remilitarised the straits area. The reversion was formalised under the <a href="Montreux%20Convention%20Regarding%20the%20Regime%20of%20the%20Turkish%20Straits">Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits</a> of 20 July 1936. That convention, which is still in force, treats the straits as an international shipping lane save that Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-Black Sea states.

Turkey was neutral in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> until February 1945, and the straits were closed to the warships of belligerent nations during this time, although some German <a href="auxiliaries">auxiliary vessels</a> were permitted to transit. In diplomatic conferences, <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> representatives had made known <a href="Turkish%20Straits%20crisis">their interest</a> in Turkish concession of Soviet naval bases on the straits. This, as well as Stalin's demands for the restitution of the Turkish provinces of <a href="Kars%20Province">Kars</a>, <a href="Artvin">Artvin</a> and <a href="Ardahan">Ardahan</a> to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> (which were lost by Turkey in the Russo–Turkish War of 1877–1878, but were regained with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Kars">Treaty of Kars</a> in 1921), were considerations in Turkey's decision to abandon <a href="country%20neutrality%20%28international%20relations%29">neutrality in foreign affairs</a>. Turkey declared war against Germany in February 1945, but did not engage in offensive actions.

Turkey joined <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in 1952, thus affording its straits even more strategic importance as a commercial and military waterway.

During the early 21st century, the <a href="Turkish%20Straits">Turkish Straits</a> have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as <a href="Novorossyisk">Novorossyisk</a>, is exported by tankers primarily to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits. In 2011 Turkey planned a 50 km canal through <a href="Silivri">Silivri</a> as a second waterway, reducing risk in the Bosphorus.

The waters of the Bosphorus are traversed by numerous passenger and vehicular ferries daily, as well as recreational and fishing boats ranging from dinghies to yachts owned by both public and private entities.

The strait also experiences significant amounts of international commercial shipping traffic by <a href="Cargo%20ship">freighters</a> and <a href="Tanker%20%28ship%29">tankers</a>. Between its northern limits at <a href="Rumeli%20Feneri">Rumeli Feneri</a> and <a href="Anadolu%20Feneri">Anadolu Feneri</a> and its southern ones at <a href="Ah%C4%B1rkap%C4%B1%20Feneri">Ahırkapı Feneri</a> and <a href="Kad%C4%B1k%C3%B6y%20%C4%B0nciburnu%20Feneri">Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri</a>, there are numerous dangerous points for large-scale maritime traffic that require sharp turns and management of visual obstructions. Famously, the stretch between <a href="Kandilli%2C%20%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar">Kandilli Point</a> and <a href="A%C5%9Fiyan">Aşiyan</a> requires a 45-degree course alteration in a location where the currents can reach . To the south, at <a href="Yenik%C3%B6y%2C%20Istanbul">Yeniköy</a>, the necessary course alteration is 80 degrees. Compounding these difficult changes in trajectory, the rear and forward sight lines at <a href="Kandilli%2C%20%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar">Kandilli</a> and <a href="Yenik%C3%B6y%2C%20Istanbul">Yeniköy</a> are also completely blocked prior to and during the course alteration, making it impossible for ships approaching from the opposite direction to see around these bends. The risks posed by geography are further multiplied by the heavy ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city. As such, all the dangers and obstacles characteristic of narrow waterways are present and acute in this critical sea lane.

In 2011, the Turkish Government discussed creating a large-scale canal project roughly long that runs north-south through <a href="Silivri">the western edges of Istanbul Province</a> as a second waterway between the Black Sea and the Marmara, intended to reduce risk in the Bosphorus. This <a href="Kanal%20%C4%B0stanbul">Kanal İstanbul</a> project currently continues to be debated.

Two <a href="suspension%20bridge">suspension bridge</a>s and a <a href="cable-stayed%20bridge">cable-stayed bridge</a> cross the Bosphorus. The first of these, the <a href="Bosphorus%20Bridge">15th July Martyrs Bridge</a>, is long and was completed in 1973. The second, named <a href="Fatih%20Sultan%20Mehmet%20Bridge">Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Bosphorus II) Bridge</a>, is long, and was completed in 1988 about north of the first bridge. The first Bosphorus Bridge forms part of the <a href="Otoyol%201">O1 Motorway</a>, while the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge forms part of the <a href="Trans-European%20Motorway">Trans-European Motorway</a>. The third, <a href="Yavuz%20Sultan%20Selim%20Bridge">Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge</a>, is long and was completed in 2016. It is located near the northern end of the Bosphorus, between the villages of Garipçe on the European side and Poyrazköy on the Asian side, as part of the "Northern Marmara Motorway", integrated with the existing Black Sea Coastal Highway, and allowing transit traffic to bypass city traffic.

The <a href="Marmaray">Marmaray</a> project, featuring a long undersea <a href="Rail%20transport">railway</a> <a href="tunnel">tunnel</a>, opened on 29 October 2013. Approximately of the tunnel runs under the strait, at a depth of about .

An undersea <a href="Water%20tunnel%20%28physical%20infrastructure%29">water supply tunnel</a> with a length of , named the <a href="Bosporus%20Water%20Tunnel">Bosporus Water Tunnel</a>, was constructed in 2012 to transfer water from the Melen Creek in <a href="D%C3%BCzce%20Province">Düzce Province</a> (to the east of the Bosphorus strait, in northwestern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>) to the European side of Istanbul, a distance of .

The <a href="Eurasia%20Tunnel">Eurasia Tunnel</a> is an undersea <a href="highway">highway</a> tunnel, crossing the Bosphorus for vehicular traffic, between <a href="Kazl%C4%B1%C3%A7e%C5%9Fme">Kazlıçeşme</a> and <a href="G%C3%B6ztepe%2C%20Istanbul">Göztepe</a>, for which construction began in February 2011, was opened on 20 December 2016.

The Bosphorus has 620 <a href="yal%C4%B1">waterfront houses ("yalı")</a> built during the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> period along the strait's European and Asian shorelines. Ottoman palaces such as the <a href="Topkap%C4%B1%20Palace">Topkapı Palace</a>, <a href="Dolmabah%C3%A7e%20Palace">Dolmabahçe Palace</a>, <a href="Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z%20Palace">Yıldız Palace</a>, <a href="%C3%87%C4%B1ra%C4%9Fan%20Palace">Çırağan Palace</a>, <a href="Feriye%20Palaces">Feriye Palaces</a>, <a href="Beylerbeyi%20Palace">Beylerbeyi Palace</a>, <a href="K%C3%BC%C3%A7%C3%BCksu%20Palace">Küçüksu Palace</a>, <a href="Ihlamur%20Palace">Ihlamur Palace</a>, <a href="Hatice%20Sultan%20Palace">Hatice Sultan Palace</a>, <a href="Adile%20Sultan%20Palace">Adile Sultan Palace</a> and <a href="Khedive%20Palace">Khedive Palace</a> are within its view. Buildings and landmarks within view include the <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>, <a href="Hagia%20Irene">Hagia Irene</a>, <a href="Sultan%20Ahmed%20Mosque">Sultan Ahmed Mosque</a>, <a href="New%20Mosque%20%28Istanbul%29">Yeni Mosque</a>, <a href="K%C4%B1l%C4%B1%C3%A7%20Ali%20Pasha%20Complex">Kılıç Ali Pasha Mosque</a>, <a href="Nusretiye%20Mosque">Nusretiye Mosque</a>, <a href="Dolmabah%C3%A7e%20Mosque">Dolmabahçe Mosque</a>, <a href="Ortak%C3%B6y%20Mosque">Ortaköy Mosque</a>, <a href="Mihrimah%20Sultan%20Mosque%20%28%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar%29">Üsküdar Mihrimah Sultan Mosque</a>, <a href="Yeni%20Valide%20Mosque">Yeni Valide Mosque</a>, <a href="Maiden%27s%20Tower">Maiden's Tower</a>, <a href="Galata%20Tower">Galata Tower</a>, <a href="Rumelihisar%C4%B1">Rumelian Castle</a>, <a href="Anadoluhisar%C4%B1">Anatolian Castle</a>, <a href="Yoros%20Castle">Yoros Castle</a>, <a href="Selimiye%20Barracks">Selimiye Barracks</a>, <a href="Sak%C4%B1p%20Sabanc%C4%B1%20Museum">Sakıp Sabancı Museum</a>, <a href="Sadberk%20Han%C4%B1m%20Museum">Sadberk Hanım Museum</a>, <a href="%C4%B0stanbul%20Modern">Istanbul Museum of Modern Art</a>, <a href="Perili%20K%C3%B6%C5%9Fk">Borusan Museum of Contemporary Art</a>, <a href="Tophane">Tophane</a>-i Amire Museum, <a href="Mimar%20Sinan%20Fine%20Arts%20University">Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University</a>, <a href="Galatasaray%20University">Galatasaray University</a>, <a href="Bo%C4%9Fazi%C3%A7i%20University">Boğaziçi University</a>, <a href="Robert%20College">Robert College</a>, <a href="Kabata%C5%9F%20High%20School">Kabataş High School</a>, <a href="Kuleli%20Military%20High%20School">Kuleli Military High School</a>.

Two points in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> have most of the <a href="ferries%20in%20Istanbul">public ferries</a> that traverse the strait: from <a href="Emin%C3%B6n%C3%BC">Eminönü</a> (ferries dock at the "Boğaz İskelesi" pier) on the <a href="Constantinople">historic peninsula</a> of Istanbul to <a href="Yoros%20Castle%23Anadolu%20Kava%C4%9F%C4%B1">Anadolu Kavağı</a> near the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, zigzagging and calling briefly multiple times at the <a href="Rumelia">Rumelia</a>n and <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>n sides of the city. At central piers shorter, regular ride in one of the public ferries cross.

Private ferries operate between <a href="%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar">Üsküdar</a> and <a href="Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F">Beşiktaş</a> or <a href="Kabata%C5%9F%2C%20Istanbul">Kabataş</a> in the city. The few well-known geographic hazards are multiplied by ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city, particularly for the largest ships.

The catamaran <a href="%C4%B0DO">seabuses</a> offer high-speed commuter services between the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus, but they stop at fewer <a href="port">port</a>s and <a href="pier">pier</a>s in comparison to the public ferries. Both the public ferries and the seabuses also provide commuter services between the Bosphorus and the <a href="Prince%20Islands">Prince Islands</a> in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>.

There are also tourist rides available in various places along the coasts of the Bosphorus. The prices vary according to the type of the ride, and some feature loud popular music for the duration of the trip.
