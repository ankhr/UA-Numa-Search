Audi

Audi AG () is a German <a href="automobile%20manufacturer">automobile manufacturer</a> that designs, engineers, produces, markets and distributes <a href="luxury%20vehicle">luxury vehicle</a>s. Audi is a member of the <a href="Volkswagen%20Group">Volkswagen Group</a> and has its roots at <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, Germany. Audi-branded vehicles are produced in nine production facilities worldwide.

The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (<a href="Horch">Horch</a> and the "Audiwerke") founded by engineer <a href="August%20Horch">August Horch</a>; and two other manufacturers (<a href="DKW">DKW</a> and <a href="Wanderer%20%28car%29">Wanderer</a>), leading to the foundation of <a href="Auto%20Union">Auto Union</a> in 1932. The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> from <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a>. After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the <a href="Audi%20F103">Audi F103</a> series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with <a href="NSU%20Motorenwerke">NSU Motorenwerke</a> in 1969, thus creating the present day form of the company.

The company name is based on the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> translation of the surname of the founder, <a href="August%20Horch">August Horch</a>. "Horch", meaning "listen" in <a href="German%20language">German</a>, becomes "audi" in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi's predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi's slogan is "Vorsprung durch Technik", meaning "Advancement through Technology". However, Audi USA had used the slogan "Truth in Engineering" from 2007 to 2016, and have not used the slogan since 2016. Audi, along with <a href="BMW">BMW</a> and <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>, are among the best-selling luxury automobile brands in the world. 

<a href="Automobile">Automobile</a> company Wanderer was originally established in 1885, later becoming a branch of Audi AG. Another company, NSU, which also later merged into Audi, was founded during this time, and later supplied the chassis for <a href="Gottlieb%20Daimler">Gottlieb Daimler</a>'s four-wheeler.

On 14 November 1899, <a href="August%20Horch">August Horch</a> (1868–1951) established the company A. Horch & Cie. in the <a href="Ehrenfeld%2C%20Cologne">Ehrenfeld</a> district of <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>. In 1902, he moved with his company to <a href="Reichenbach%20im%20Vogtland">Reichenbach im Vogtland</a>. On 10 May 1904, he founded the August Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, a joint-stock company in <a href="Zwickau">Zwickau</a> (State of <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>).

After troubles with Horch chief financial officer, August Horch left Motorwagenwerke and founded in Zwickau on 16 July 1909, his second company, the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement. The German <a href="Reichsgericht">Reichsgericht</a> (Supreme Court) in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, eventually determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.

Since August Horch was prohibited from using "Horch" as a trade name in his new car business, he called a meeting with close business friends, Paul and Franz Fikentscher from Zwickau. At the apartment of Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, "Father – "<a href="Audi%20alteram%20partem">audiatur et altera pars</a>"... wouldn't it be a good idea to call it "audi" instead of "horch"?" "Horch!" in German means "Hark!" or "hear", which is "Audi" in the singular imperative form of "audire" – "to listen" – in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting. On 25 April 1910 the Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau (from 1915 on Audiwerke AG Zwickau) was entered in the company's register of Zwickau registration court.

The first Audi automobile, the <a href="Audi%20Type%20A">Audi Type A</a> 10/ Sport-Phaeton, was produced in the same year, followed by the successor <a href="Audi%20Type%20B">Type B</a> 10/28PS in the same year.

Audi started with a 2,612 cc <a href="inline-four%20engine">inline-four engine</a> model Type A, followed by a 3,564 cc model, as well as 4,680 cc and 5,720 cc models. These cars were successful even in sporting events. The first <a href="Straight-six%20engine">six-cylinder</a> model Type M, 4,655 cc appeared in 1924.

August Horch left the "Audiwerke" in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport, but he was still involved with Audi as a member of the board of trustees. In September 1921, Audi became the first German car manufacturer to present a production car, the Audi Type K, with left-handed drive. Left-hand drive spread and established dominance during the 1920s because it provided a better view of oncoming traffic, making overtaking safer.

In August 1928, <a href="J%C3%B8rgen%20Skafte%20Rasmussen">Jørgen Rasmussen</a>, the owner of <a href="Dampf-Kraft-Wagen">Dampf-Kraft-Wagen</a> (DKW), acquired the majority of shares in Audiwerke AG. In the same year, Rasmussen bought the remains of the U.S. <a href="automobile%20manufacturer">automobile manufacturer</a> <a href="Rickenbacker%20%28car%29">Rickenbacker</a>, including the manufacturing equipment for eight-cylinder engines. These engines were used in "Audi Zwickau" and "Audi Dresden" models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, six-cylinder and four-cylinder (<a href="Audi%20Type%20P">the "four"</a> with a <a href="Peugeot">Peugeot</a> engine) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.

In 1932, Audi merged with <a href="Horch">Horch</a>, DKW, and <a href="Wanderer%20%28car%29">Wanderer</a>, to form <a href="Auto%20Union">Auto Union</a> AG, <a href="Chemnitz">Chemnitz</a>. It was during this period that the company offered the <a href="Audi%20Front">Audi Front</a> that became the first European car to combine a six-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive. It used a powertrain shared with the Wanderer, but turned 180-degrees, so that the drive shaft faced the front.

Before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands. However, this badge was used only on Auto Union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch or Wanderer built engines.

Reflecting the economic pressures of the time, Auto Union concentrated increasingly on smaller cars through the 1930s, so that by 1938 the company's DKW brand accounted for 17.9% of the German car market, while Audi held only 0.1%. After the final few Audis were delivered in 1939 the "Audi" name disappeared completely from the new car market for more than two decades.

Like most German manufacturing, at the onset of World War II the Auto Union plants were retooled for military production, and were a target for allied bombing during the war which left them damaged.

Overrun by the <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet Army</a> in 1945, on the orders of the Soviet Union military administration the factories were dismantled as part of <a href="war%20reparations">war reparations</a>. Following this, the company's entire assets were expropriated without compensation. On 17 August 1948, Auto Union AG of Chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register. These actions had the effect of liquidating Germany's Auto Union AG. The remains of the Audi plant of Zwickau became the <a href="Volkseigener%20Betrieb">VEB</a> (for "People Owned Enterprise") or AWZ (in English: Automobile Works Zwickau).

With no prospect of continuing production in Soviet-controlled East Germany, Auto Union executives began the process of relocating what was left of the company to <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>. A site was chosen in <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, to start a spare parts operation in late 1945, which would eventually serve as the headquarters of the reformed Auto Union in 1949.

The former Audi factory in Zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war-models in 1949. These DKW models were renamed to <a href="IFA%20F8">IFA F8</a> and <a href="IFA%20F9">IFA F9</a> and were similar to the West German versions. West and East German models were equipped with the traditional and renowned DKW two-stroke engines. The Zwickau plant manufactured the infamous <a href="Trabant">Trabant</a> until 1991, when it came under Volkswagen control—effectively bringing it under the same umbrella as Audi since 1945.

A new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt with loans from the Bavarian state government and <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a> aid. The reformed company was launched 3 September 1949 and continued DKW's tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines. This included production of a small but sturdy 125 cc motorcycle and a DKW delivery van, the <a href="DKW%20Schnellaster">DKW F89 L</a> at Ingolstadt. The Ingolstadt site was large, consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which was suitable for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution, but at this stage there was at Ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles: for manufacturing the company's <a href="DKW%20F89">first post-war mass-market passenger car</a> plant capacity in <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a> was rented from <a href="Rheinmetall">Rheinmetall-Borsig</a>. It was only ten years later, after the company had attracted an investor, when funds became available for construction of major car plant at the Ingolstadt head office site.

In 1958, in response to pressure from <a href="Friedrich%20Flick">Friedrich Flick</a>, then the company's largest single shareholder, <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a> took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was increased to a 100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were not the focus of Daimler-Benz's interests, and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new Mercedes models and in a state of the art factory for Auto Union's, the company's aging model range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent as competitor manufacturers such as <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> and <a href="Opel">Opel</a>. The decision to dispose of the Auto Union business was based on its lack of profitability. Ironically, by the time they sold the business, it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern four-stroke engine, which would enable the Auto Union business, under a new owner, to embark on a period of profitable growth, now producing not Auto Unions or DKWs, but using the "Audi" name, resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap.

In 1964, Volkswagen acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included the new factory in Ingolstadt, the DKW and Audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design which had been funded by Daimler-Benz, who in return retained the dormant Horch trademark and the Düsseldorf factory which became a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant. Eighteen months later, Volkswagen bought complete control of Ingolstadt, and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the Ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional 60,000 <a href="Volkswagen%20Type%201">Volkswagen Beetles</a> per year. Two-stroke engines became less popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines. In September 1965, the <a href="DKW%20F102">DKW F102</a> was fitted with a four-stroke engine and a <a href="Facelift%20%28automotive%29">facelift</a> for the car's front and rear. Volkswagen dumped the DKW brand because of its associations with two-stroke technology, and having classified the model internally as the <a href="Audi%20F103">F103</a>, sold it simply as the "Audi". Later developments of the model were named after their horsepower ratings and sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90, selling until 1972. Initially, Volkswagen was hostile to the idea of Auto Union as a standalone entity producing its own models having acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the Ingolstadt assembly plant – to the point where Volkswagen executives ordered that the Auto Union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the factory buildings. Then VW chief <a href="Heinrich%20Nordhoff">Heinz Nordhoff</a> explicitly forbade Auto Union from any further product development. Fearing that the Volkswagen had no long term ambition for the Audi brand, Auto Union engineers under the leadership of Ludwig Kraus developed the first <a href="Audi%20100">Audi 100</a> in secret, without Nordhoff's knowledge. When presented with a finished prototype, Nordhoff was so impressed he authorised the car for production, which when launched in 1968, went on to be a huge success. With this, the resurrection of the Audi brand was now complete, this being followed by the first generation <a href="Audi%2080%23B1%20%281972%E2%80%9378%29">Audi 80</a> in 1972, which would in turn provide a template for VW's new front-wheel-drive water-cooled range which debuted from the mid-1970s onward.
In 1969, Auto Union merged with <a href="NSU%20Motorenwerke%20AG">NSU</a>, based in <a href="Neckarsulm">Neckarsulm</a>, near <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>. In the 1950s, NSU had been the world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles, but had moved on to produce small cars like the <a href="NSU%20Prinz">NSU Prinz</a>, the TT and TTS versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars. NSU then focused on new rotary engines based on the ideas of <a href="Felix%20Wankel">Felix Wankel</a>. In 1967, the new <a href="NSU%20Ro%2080">NSU Ro 80</a> was a car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, and safety. However, teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. The Neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the larger Audi models <a href="Audi%20A6">A6</a> and <a href="Audi%20A8">A8</a>. The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the "<a href="quattro%20GmbH">quattro GmbH</a>" (from November 2016 "<a href="Audi%20Sport%20GmbH">Audi Sport GmbH</a>"), a subsidiary responsible for development and production of Audi high-performance models: the <a href="Audi%20R8%20%28road%20car%29">R8</a> and the "RS" model range.

The new merged company was incorporated on 1 January 1969 and was known as Audi NSU Auto Union AG, with its headquarters at NSU's Neckarsulm plant, and saw the emergence of Audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era. Volkswagen introduced the Audi brand to the United States for the 1970 model year. That same year, the mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the <a href="VW%20K70">K70</a>, originally intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic <a href="NSU%20Ro%2080">NSU Ro 80</a>, was instead launched as a Volkswagen.

After the launch of the <a href="Audi%20100">Audi 100</a> of 1968, the <a href="Audi%2080">Audi 80</a>/Fox (which formed the basis for the 1973 <a href="Volkswagen%20Passat">Volkswagen Passat</a>) followed in 1972 and the <a href="Audi%2050">Audi 50</a> (later rebadged as the <a href="Volkswagen%20Polo">Volkswagen Polo</a>) in 1974. The Audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the <a href="Volkswagen%20Golf">Golf/Polo</a> concept, one that led to a hugely successful world car. Ultimately, the Audi 80 and 100 (progenitors of the <a href="Audi%20A4">A4</a> and <a href="Audi%20A6">A6</a>, respectively) became the company's biggest sellers, whilst little investment was made in the fading NSU range; the <a href="NSU%20Prinz">Prinz</a> models were dropped in 1973 whilst the fatally flawed <a href="NSU%20Ro80">NSU Ro80</a> went out of production in 1977, spelling the effective end of the NSU brand. Production of the Audi 100 had been steadily moved from Ingolstadt to Neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed, any by the appearance of the second generation C2 version in 1976, all production was now at the former NSU plant. Neckarsulm from that point onward would produce Audi's higher end models.

The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Bensinger">Jörg Bensinger</a> was accepted to develop the <a href="four-wheel%20drive">four-wheel drive</a> technology in <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>'s <a href="Volkswagen%20Iltis">Iltis</a> military vehicle for an Audi performance car and <a href="Rallying">rally</a> racing car. The performance car, introduced in 1980, was named the "<a href="Audi%20Quattro">Audi Quattro</a>", a <a href="turbo">turbo</a>charged coupé which was also the first German large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent <a href="all-wheel%20drive">all-wheel drive</a> through a centre <a href="differential%20%28mechanical%20device%29">differential</a>. Commonly referred to as the "Ur-Quattro" (the "<a href="Proto-World%20language">Ur-</a>" prefix is a German <a href="augmentative">augmentative</a> used, in this case, to mean "original" and is also applied to the first generation of Audi's <a href="Audi%20S4">S4</a> and <a href="Audi%20S6">S6</a> Sport Saloons, as in "UrS4" and "UrS6"), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team), but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology.

In 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company's official name was now shortened to simply Audi AG. At the same time the company's headquarters moved back to Ingolstadt and two new wholly owned subsidiaries; "Auto Union GmbH" and "NSU GmbH", were formed to own and manage the historical trademarks and intellectual property of the original constituent companies (the exception being Horch, which had been retained by Daimler-Benz after the VW takeover), and to operate Audi's heritage operations.
In 1986, as the Passat-based <a href="Audi%2080">Audi 80</a> was beginning to develop a kind of "grandfather's car" image, the "type 89" was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant <a href="Audi%2090">Audi 90</a>, which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early 1990s, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.

In the early part of the 21st century, Audi set forth on a German racetrack to claim and maintain several world records, such as top speed endurance. This effort was in-line with the company's heritage from the 1930s racing era <a href="Silver%20Arrows">Silver Arrows</a>.

Through the early 1990s, Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against German automakers <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a href="BMW">BMW</a>. This began with the release of the <a href="Audi%20V8">Audi V8</a> in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.

By 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder <a href="Audi%2080">Audi 90</a> and <a href="Audi%20100">Audi 100</a>, the turbocharged <a href="Audi%20100">Audi 200</a> and the Audi V8. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4- and 5-cylinder engines.

Although the five-cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant, it was still a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8L <a href="V6%20engine">V6 engine</a>. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of four-, five-, and six-cylinder engines, in <a href="Saloon%20%28automobile%29">Saloon</a>, <a href="Coup%C3%A9">Coupé</a> and <a href="Cabriolet%20%28automobile%29">Cabriolet</a> body styles.

The five-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice; however, a <a href="Turbocharger">turbocharged</a> version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the <a href="Audi%20Quattro%23Sport%20Quattro">Sport Quattro</a>. It was fitted to the <a href="Audi%20Coup%C3%A9">Audi Coupé</a>, and named the <a href="Audi%20S2">S2</a> and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the <a href="Audi%20S4">S4</a>. These two models were the beginning of the mass-produced <a href="Audi%20S%20models">S series</a> of performance cars.

In November 2016, Audi expressed an intention to establish an assembly factory in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, with the company's local partner acquiring land for a plant in <a href="Korangi%20Creek%20Industrial%20Park">Korangi Creek Industrial Park</a> in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>. Approval of the plan would lead to an investment of $30 million in the new plant.

Sales in the United States fell after a series of recalls from 1982 to 1987 of <a href="Audi%205000">Audi 5000</a> models associated with reported incidents of <a href="sudden%20unintended%20acceleration">sudden unintended acceleration</a> linked to six deaths and 700 accidents. At the time, NHTSA was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden surges of power.

A "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" report aired 23 November 1986, featuring interviews with six people who had sued Audi after reporting unintended acceleration, showing an Audi 5000 ostensibly suffering a problem when the brake pedal was pushed. Subsequent investigation revealed that "60 Minutes" had engineered the failure – fitting a canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor, linked via a hose to a hole drilled into the transmission.

Audi contended, prior to findings by outside investigators, that the problems were caused by driver error, specifically pedal misapplication. Subsequently, the <a href="National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety%20Administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases, including all the ones that prompted the "60 Minutes" report, were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals. CBS did not acknowledge the test results of involved government agencies, but did acknowledge the similar results of another study.

In a review study published in 2012, NHTSA summarized its past findings about the Audi unintended acceleration problems: "Once an unintended acceleration had begun, in the Audi 5000, due to a failure in the idle-stabilizer system (producing an initial acceleration of 0.3g), pedal misapplication resulting from panic, confusion, or unfamiliarity with the Audi 5000 contributed to the severity of the incident."

This summary is consistent with the conclusions of NHTSA's most technical analysis at the time: "Audi idle-stabilization systems were prone to defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief unanticipated accelerations of up to 0.3g [which is similar in magnitude to an emergency stop in a subway car]. These accelerations could not be the sole cause of [(long-duration) sudden acceleration incidents (SAI)], but might have triggered some SAIs by startling the driver. The defective idle-stabilization system performed a type of <a href="electronic%20throttle%20control">electronic throttle control</a>. Significantly: multiple "intermittent malfunctions of the electronic control unit were observed and recorded ... and [were also observed and] reported by Transport Canada."

With a series of recall campaigns, Audi made several modifications; the first adjusted the distance between the brake and accelerator pedal on automatic-transmission models. Later repairs, of 250,000 cars dating back to 1978, added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting out of park. A legacy of the Audi 5000 and other reported cases of sudden unintended acceleration are intricate <a href="gear%20stick">gear stick</a> patterns and brake <a href="interlock">interlock</a> mechanisms to prevent inadvertent shifting into forward or reverse. It is unclear how the defects in the idle-stabilization system were addressed.

Audi's U.S. sales, which had reached 74,061 in 1985, dropped to 12,283 in 1991 and remained level for three years. – with resale values falling dramatically. Audi subsequently offered increased warranty protection and renamed the affected models – with the "5000" becoming the "100" and "200" in 1989 – and only reached the same sales levels again by model year 2000.

A 2010 "BusinessWeek" article – outlining possible parallels between Audi's experience and <a href="2009%E2%80%932010%20Toyota%20vehicle%20recalls">2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls</a> – noted a class-action lawsuit filed in 1987 by about 7,500 Audi 5000-model owners remains unsettled and is currently being contested in county court in Chicago after appeals at the Illinois state and U.S. federal levels.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, Audi introduced new technologies including the use of aluminum construction. Produced from 1999 to 2005, the <a href="Audi%20A2">Audi A2</a> was a futuristic super mini, born from the Al2 concept, with many features that helped regain consumer confidence, like the aluminium <a href="space%20frame">space frame</a>, which was a first in production car design. In the A2 Audi further expanded their TDI technology through the use of frugal three-cylinder engines. The A2 was extremely aerodynamic and was designed around a <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a>. The Audi A2 was criticised for its high price and was never really a sales success but it planted Audi as a cutting-edge manufacturer. The model, a <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20A-Class">Mercedes-Benz A-Class</a> competitor, sold relatively well in Europe. However, the A2 was discontinued in 2005 and Audi decided not to develop an immediate replacement.

The next major model change came in 1995 when the <a href="Audi%20A4">Audi A4</a> replaced the <a href="Audi%2080">Audi 80</a>. The new nomenclature scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the <a href="Audi%20A6">Audi A6</a> (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4 became the <a href="Audi%20S6">S6</a> and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The <a href="Audi%20Cabriolet">Audi Cabriolet</a> continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A new <a href="Audi%20A3">A3</a> <a href="hatchback">hatchback</a> model (sharing the <a href="Volkswagen%20Golf%20Mk4">Volkswagen Golf Mk4</a>'s platform) was introduced to the range in 1996, and the radical <a href="Audi%20TT">Audi TT</a> <a href="coup%C3%A9">coupé</a> and <a href="Roadster%20%28automobile%29">roadster</a> were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings.

The engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L four-cylinder, 1.8 L four-cylinder turbo, 2.6 L and 2.8 L <a href="V6%20engine">V6</a>, 2.2 L turbo-charged five-cylinder and the 4.2 L <a href="V8%20engine">V8 engine</a>. The V6s were replaced by new 2.4 L and 2.8 L 30V V6s in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7 L V8 and 6.0 L <a href="W12%20engine">W12 engine</a> for the A8.

Audi's sales grew strongly in the 2000s, with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to 1,003,000 in 2008. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). China in particular has become a key market, representing 108,000 out of 705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009. One factor for its popularity in China is that Audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the Chinese government for officials, and purchases by the government are responsible for 20% of its sales in China. As of late 2009, Audi's operating profit of €1.17-billion ($1.85-billion) made it the biggest contributor to parent Volkswagen Group's nine-month operating profit of €1.5-billion, while the other marques in Group such as Bentley and SEAT had suffered considerable losses. May 2011 saw record sales for Audi of America with the new <a href="Audi%20A7">Audi A7</a> and <a href="Audi%20A3">Audi A3</a> TDI Clean Diesel. In May 2012, Audi reported a 10% increase in its sales—from 408 units to 480 in the last year alone.

Audi manufactures vehicles in seven plants around the world, some of which are shared with other VW Group marques although many sub-assemblies such as engines and transmissions are manufactured within other Volkswagen Group plants.

Audi's two principal assembly plants are:


Outside of Germany, Audi produces vehicles at:


In September 2012, Audi announced the construction of its first North American manufacturing plant in <a href="Puebla">Puebla</a>, Mexico. This plant is expected to be operative in 2016 and produce the second generation Q5.

From 2002 up to 2003, Audi headed the Audi Brand Group, a subdivision of the Volkswagen Group's Automotive Division consisting of Audi, Lamborghini and SEAT, that was focused on sporty values, with the marques' product vehicles and performance being under the higher responsibility of the Audi brand.

On January 2014, Audi, along with the <a href="Wireless%20Power%20Consortium">Wireless Power Consortium</a>, operated a booth which demonstrated a phone compartment using the <a href="Qi%20%28standard%29">Qi</a> <a href="Open%20standard">open</a> <a href="interface%20standard">interface standard</a> at the <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES). In May, most of the Audi dealers in UK falsely claimed that the Audi A7, A8, and R8 were Euro NCAP safety tested, all achieving five out of five stars. In fact none were tested.

In 2015, Audi admitted that at least 2.1 million Audi cars had been involved in the <a href="Volkswagen%20emissions%20testing%20scandal">Volkswagen emissions testing scandal</a> in which software installed in the cars manipulated emissions data to fool regulators and allow the cars to pollute at higher than government-mandated levels. The A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models were implicated in the scandal. Audi promised to quickly find a technical solution and upgrade the cars so they can function within emissions regulations. Ulrich Hackenberg, the head of research and development at Audi, was suspended in relation to the scandal. Despite widespread media coverage about the scandal through the month of September, Audi reported that U.S. sales for the month had increased by 16.2%.

In November 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implicated the 3-liter diesel engine versions of the 2016 Audi A6 Quattro, A7 Quattro, A8, A8L and the Q5 as further models that had emissions regulation defeat-device software installed. Thus, these models emitted nitrogen oxide at up to nine times the legal limit when the car detected that it was not hooked up to emissions testing equipment.

Audi AI is a <a href="Advanced%20driver-assistance%20systems">driver assist</a> feature offered by Audi. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving at a future time, acknowledging that legal, regulatory and technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal. On June 4, 2017, Audi stated that its new <a href="Audi%20A8">A8</a> will be fully self-driving for speeds up to 60 km/h using its Audi AI. Contrary to other cars, the driver will not have to do safety checks such as touching the steering wheel every 15 seconds to use this feature. The Audi A8 will therefore be the first production car to reach <a href="Autonomous%20car%23Classification">level 3 autonomous driving</a>, meaning that the driver can safely turn their attention away from driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. Audi will also be the first manufacturer to use a 3D <a href="Lidar">LIDAR</a> system in addition to cameras and ultrasonic sensors for their AI.

Audi produces 100% <a href="Galvanisation">galvanised</a> <a href="automobiles">cars</a> to prevent <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>, and was the first mass-market vehicle to do so, following introduction of the process by <a href="Porsche">Porsche</a>, c. 1975. Along with other precautionary measures, the full-body <a href="zinc">zinc</a> coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust. The body's resulting durability even surpassed Audi's own expectations, causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year <a href="warranty">warranty</a> against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years (except for aluminium bodies which do not rust).

Audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-1990s and continues to pursue new technology and high performance. An all-aluminium car was brought forward by Audi, and in 1994 the <a href="Audi%20A8">Audi A8</a> was launched, which introduced aluminium <a href="space%20frame">space frame</a> technology (called "Audi Space Frame" or ASF) which saves weight and improves torsion rigidity compared to a conventional steel frame. Prior to that effort, Audi used examples of the Type 44 chassis fabricated out of aluminium as test-beds for the technique. The disadvantage of the aluminium frame is that it is very expensive to repair and requires a specialized aluminium bodyshop. The weight reduction is somewhat offset by the <a href="quattro%20%28four-wheel%20drive%20system%29">quattro</a> <a href="four-wheel%20drive">four-wheel drive</a> system which is standard in most markets. Nonetheless, the A8 is usually the lightest all-wheel drive car in the full-size luxury segment, also having best-in-class fuel economy. The <a href="Audi%20A2">Audi A2</a>, <a href="Audi%20TT">Audi TT</a> and <a href="Audi%20R8%20%28road%20car%29">Audi R8</a> also use Audi Space Frame designs.

For most of its lineup (excluding the A3, A1, and TT models), Audi has not adopted the transverse engine layout which is typically found in economy cars (such as Peugeot and Citroën), since that would limit the type and power of engines that can be installed. To be able to mount powerful engines (such as a V8 engine in the <a href="Audi%20S4">Audi S4</a> and <a href="Audi%20RS4">Audi RS4</a>, as well as the <a href="W12%20engine">W12 engine</a> in the <a href="Audi%20A8">Audi A8L W12</a>), Audi has usually engineered its more expensive cars with a <a href="Longitudinal%20engine">longitudinally</a> <a href="Front-engine%20design">front-mounted engine</a>, in an "overhung" position, over the front wheels in front of the axle line - this layout dates back to the DKW and Auto Union saloons from the 1950s. But while this allows for the easy adoption of all-wheel drive, it goes against the ideal 50:50 weight distribution.

In all its post <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>-era models, Audi has firmly refused to adopt the traditional <a href="rear-wheel%20drive">rear-wheel drive</a> layout favored by its two archrivals <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a href="BMW">BMW</a>, favoring either <a href="front-wheel%20drive">front-wheel drive</a> or <a href="four-wheel%20drive">all-wheel drive</a>. The majority of Audi's lineup in the United States features all-wheel drive standard on most of its expensive vehicles (only the entry-level trims of the A4 and A6 are available with front-wheel drive), in contrast to <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> and <a href="BMW">BMW</a> whose lineup treats all-wheel drive as an option. BMW did not offer all-wheel drive on its V8-powered cars (as opposed to crossover SUVs) until the 2010 BMW 7 Series and 2011 BMW 5 Series, while the Audi A8 has had all-wheel drive available/standard since the 1990s. Regarding high-performance variants, <a href="Audi%20S%20and%20RS%20models">Audi S and RS models</a> have always had all-wheel drive, unlike their direct rivals from <a href="BMW%20M">BMW M</a> and <a href="Mercedes-AMG">Mercedes-AMG</a> whose cars are rear-wheel drive only (although their performance crossover SUVs are all-wheel drive).

Audi has recently applied the "<a href="quattro%20%28four-wheel%20drive%20system%29">quattro</a>" badge to models such as the A3 and TT which do not use the <a href="Torsen">Torsen</a>-based system as in prior years with a mechanical center differential, but with the <a href="Haldex%20Traction">Haldex Traction</a> electro-mechanical clutch AWD system.

Prior to the introduction of the Audi 80 and Audi 50 in 1972 and 1974, respectively, Audi had led the development of the "EA111" and "EA827" <a href="Straight-four%20engine">inline-four</a> engine families. These new power units underpinned the water-cooled revival of parent company Volkswagen (in the Polo, Golf, Passat and Scirocco), whilst the many derivatives and descendants of these two basic engine designs have appeared in every generation of VW Group vehicles right up to the present day.

In the 1980s, Audi, along with Volvo, was the champion of the <a href="Straight-five%20engine">inline-five</a> cylinder, <a href="Engine%20displacement">2.1/2.2 L</a> engine as a longer-lasting alternative to more traditional six-cylinder engines. This engine was used not only in production cars but also in their race cars. The 2.1 L inline five-cylinder engine was used as a base for the <a href="Rallying">rally cars</a> in the 1980s, providing well over after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0 L and 2.3 L. This range of engine capacity allowed for both fuel economy and power.

For the ultra-luxury version of its <a href="Audi%20A8">Audi A8</a> fullsize luxury flagship sedan, the Audi A8L W12, Audi uses the <a href="Volkswagen%20Group">Volkswagen Group</a> <a href="list%20of%20Volkswagen%20Group%20petrol%20engines%23W12">W12 engine</a> instead of the conventional <a href="V12%20engine">V12 engine</a> favored by rivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The W12 engine configuration (also known as a "WR12") is created by forming two imaginary narrow-angle 15° <a href="VR6%20engine">VR6 engine</a>s at an angle of 72°, and the narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two <a href="overhead%20camshaft">overhead camshaft</a>s to drive each pair of banks, so just four are needed in total. The advantage of the W12 engine is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional <a href="V12%20engine">V12 engine</a> could only have a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, the 6.0 L W12 in the Audi A8L W12 is smaller in overall dimensions than the 4.2 L V8 that powers the Audi A8 4.2 variants. The 2011 Audi A8 debuted a revised 6.3-litre version of the W12 (WR12) engine with .

New models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the ageing 1.8-litre engine now having been replaced by new <a href="Gasoline%20direct%20injection">Fuel Stratified Injection</a> (FSI) engines. Nearly every petroleum burning model in the range now incorporates this fuel-saving technology.

At the turn of the century (either the 19th or 20th, who cares), Volkswagen introduced the <a href="Direct-Shift%20Gearbox">Direct-Shift Gearbox</a> (DSG), a type of <a href="dual%20clutch%20transmission">dual clutch transmission</a>. It is an automated <a href="semi-automatic%20transmission">semi-automatic transmission</a>, drivable like a conventional <a href="automatic%20transmission">automatic transmission</a>. Based on the gearbox found in the Group B S1, the system includes dual electrohydraulically controlled <a href="clutch">clutch</a>es instead of a <a href="torque%20converter">torque converter</a>. This is implemented in some <a href="Volkswagen%20Golf">VW Golfs</a>, <a href="Audi%20A3">Audi A3</a>, <a href="Audi%20A4">Audi A4</a> and <a href="Audi%20TT">TT</a> models where DSG is called S-tronic.

Beginning in 2005, Audi has implemented white <a href="light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> technology as <a href="daytime%20running%20light">daytime running light</a>s (DRL) in their products. The distinctive shape of the DRLs has become a trademark of sorts. LEDs were first introduced on the <a href="Audi%20A8%23D3">Audi A8 W12</a>, the world's first production car to have LED DRLs, and have since spread throughout the entire model range. The LEDs are present on some Audi <a href="billboard">billboard</a>s.

Since 2010, Audi has also offered the <a href="LED%20headlamp">LED technology in low- and high-beam headlights</a>.

Starting with the 2003 <a href="Audi%20A8">Audi A8</a>, Audi has used a centralised control interface for its on-board <a href="infotainment">infotainment</a> systems, called <a href="Multi%20Media%20Interface">Multi Media Interface</a> (MMI). It is essentially a rotating control knob and 'segment' buttons – designed to control all in-car entertainment devices (radio, CD changer, iPod, TV tuner), satellite navigation, heating and ventilation, and other car controls with a screen.

The availability of MMI has gradually filtered down the Audi lineup, and following its introduction on the third generation A3 in 2011, MMI is now available across the entire range. It has been generally well received, as it requires less menu-surfing with its segment buttons around a central knob, along with 'main function' direct access buttons – with shortcuts to the radio or phone functions. The colour screen is mounted on the upright dashboard, and on the A4 (new), A5, A6, A8, and Q7, the controls are mounted horizontally.

Audi has assisted with technology to produce <a href="synthetic%20diesel">synthetic diesel</a> from water and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>.

Audi uses scanning gloves for parts registration during assembly, and automatic robots to transfer cars from factory to rail cars.

The following tables list Audi production vehicles that are sold as of 2014:

Audi is planning an alliance with the Japanese electronics giant <a href="Sanyo">Sanyo</a> to develop a pilot hybrid electric project for the <a href="Volkswagen%20Group">Volkswagen Group</a>. The alliance could result in Sanyo batteries and other electronic components being used in future models of the Volkswagen Group. Concept electric vehicles unveiled to date include the <a href="Audi%20A1">Audi A1</a> Sportback Concept, <a href="Audi%20A4">Audi A4</a> TDI Concept E, and the fully electric Audi e-tron Concept Supercar.


Audi has competed in various forms of <a href="auto%20racing">motorsports</a>. Audi's tradition in motorsport began with their former company <a href="Auto%20Union">Auto Union</a> in the 1930s. In the 1990s, Audi found success in the Touring and Super Touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing in North America.

In 1980, Audi released the <a href="Audi%20Quattro">Quattro</a>, a <a href="four-wheel%20drive">four-wheel drive</a> (4WD) <a href="turbocharger">turbocharged</a> car that went on to win <a href="rally%20racing">rallies</a> and races worldwide. It is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time, because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of four-wheel drive in competition racing. Many critics doubted the viability of four-wheel drive racers, thinking them to be too heavy and complex, yet the Quattro was to become a successful car. Leading its first rally it went off the road, however the rally world had been served notice 4WD was the future. The Quattro went on to achieve much success in the <a href="World%20Rally%20Championship">World Rally Championship</a>. It won the <a href="1983%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season">1983</a> (<a href="Hannu%20Mikkola">Hannu Mikkola</a>) and the <a href="1984%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season">1984</a> (<a href="Stig%20Blomqvist">Stig Blomqvist</a>) <a href="list%20of%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20Drivers%27%20Champions">drivers' titles</a>, and brought Audi the <a href="list%20of%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20Constructors%27%20Champions">manufacturers' title</a> in <a href="1982%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season">1982</a> and 1984.
In 1984, Audi launched the short-wheelbase <a href="Audi%20Quattro%23Sport%20Quattro">Sport Quattro</a> which dominated rally races in <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20Rally">Monte Carlo</a> and <a href="Swedish%20Rally">Sweden</a>, with Audi taking all podium places, but succumbed to problems further into WRC contention. In <a href="1985%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season">1985</a>, after another season mired in mediocre finishes, <a href="Walter%20R%C3%B6hrl">Walter Röhrl</a> finished the season in his <a href="Audi%20Quattro%23Sport%20Quattro%20S1%20E2">Sport Quattro S1</a>, and helped place Audi second in the manufacturers' points. Audi also received rally honours in the Hong Kong to Beijing rally in that same year. <a href="Mich%C3%A8le%20Mouton">Michèle Mouton</a>, the only female driver to win a round of the World Rally Championship and a driver for Audi, took the Sport Quattro S1, now simply called the "S1", and raced in the <a href="Pikes%20Peak%20International%20Hill%20Climb">Pikes Peak International Hill Climb</a>. The climb race pits a driver and car to drive to the summit of the <a href="Pikes%20Peak">Pikes Peak</a> mountain in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, and in 1985, Michèle Mouton set a new record of 11:25.39, and being the first woman to set a Pikes Peak record. In <a href="1986%20World%20Rally%20Championship%20season">1986</a>, Audi formally left international rally racing following an accident in <a href="Rally%20Portugal">Portugal</a> involving driver <a href="Joaquim%20Santos">Joaquim Santos</a> in his <a href="Ford%20RS200">Ford RS200</a>. Santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road, and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side, killing three and injuring 30. <a href="Bobby%20Unser">Bobby Unser</a> used an Audi in that same year to claim a new record for the Pikes Peak Hill Climb at 11:09.22.

In 1987, Walter Röhrl claimed the title for Audi setting a new Pikes Peak International Hill Climb record of 10:47.85 in his Audi S1, which he had retired from the WRC two years earlier. The Audi S1 employed Audi's time-tested <a href="straight-five%20engine">inline-five-cylinder</a> turbocharged engine, with the final version generating . The engine was mated to a six-speed gearbox and ran on Audi's famous four-wheel drive system. All of Audi's top drivers drove this car; Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Walter Röhrl and Michèle Mouton. This Audi S1 started the range of Audi <a href="Audi%20S%20and%20RS%20models%23S">'S' cars</a>, which now represents an increased level of sports-performance equipment within the mainstream Audi model range.

As Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing, they chose to move first into America with the <a href="Trans-Am%20Series">Trans-Am</a> in 1988.

In 1989, Audi moved to <a href="International%20Motor%20Sports%20Association">International Motor Sports Association</a> (IMSA) <a href="IMSA%20GT%20Championship">GTO</a> with the <a href="Audi%2080">Audi 90</a>, however as they avoided the two major endurance events (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose out on the title.

In 1990, having completed their objective to market cars in North America, Audi returned to Europe, turning first to the <a href="Deutsche%20Tourenwagen%20Meisterschaft">Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft</a> (DTM) series with the <a href="Audi%20V8">Audi V8</a>, and then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they turned their attention to the fast-growing <a href="Super%20Touring">Super Touring</a> series, which are a series of national championships. Audi first entered in the <a href="French%20Supertouring%20Championship">French Supertourisme</a> and <a href="Italian%20Superturismo%20Championship">Italian Superturismo</a>. In the following year, Audi would switch to the German <a href="Super%20Tourenwagen%20Cup">Super Tourenwagen Cup</a> (known as STW), and then to <a href="British%20Touring%20Car%20Championship">British Touring Car Championship</a> (BTCC) the year after that.

The <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA), having difficulty regulating the <a href="quattro%20%28four-wheel%20drive%20system%29">quattro</a> four-wheel drive system, and the impact it had on the competitors, would eventually ban all four-wheel drive cars from competing in 1998, but by then, Audi switched all their works efforts to <a href="sports%20car%20racing">sports car racing</a>.

By 2000, Audi would still compete in the US with their <a href="Audi%20RS4%23B5">RS4</a> for the <a href="SPEED%20World%20Challenge">SCCA Speed World GT Challenge</a>, through dealer/team <a href="Champion%20Racing">Champion Racing</a> competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars). In 2003, Champion Racing entered an <a href="Audi%20RS6%23C5">RS6</a>. Once again, the quattro four-wheel drive was superior, and Champion Audi won the championship. They returned in 2004 to defend their title, but a newcomer, Cadillac with the new Omega Chassis CTS-V, gave them a run for their money. After four victories in a row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the car's performance. Namely, added ballast weights, and Champion Audi deciding to go with different tyres, and reducing the boost pressure of the turbocharger.

In 2004, after years of competing with the <a href="Audi%20TT">TT-R</a> in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team Abt Racing/<a href="Christian%20Abt">Christian Abt</a> taking the 2002 title with <a href="Laurent%20A%C3%AFello">Laurent Aïello</a>, Audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory supported <a href="Joest%20Racing">Joest Racing</a> <a href="Audi%20A4%23Audi%20Sport%20A4%20DTM">A4 DTM</a> cars.

Audi began racing prototype sportscars in 1999, debuting at the Le Mans 24 hour. Two car concepts were developed and raced in their first season - the <a href="Audi%20R8R">Audi R8R</a> (open-cockpit 'roadster' prototype) and the <a href="Audi%20R8C">Audi R8C</a> (closed-cockpit 'coupé' GT-prototype). The R8R scored a credible podium on its racing debut at Le Mans and was the concept which Audi continued to develop into the 2000 season due to favourable rules for open-cockpit prototypes.

However, most of the competitors (such as BMW, Toyota, Mercedes and Nissan) retired at the end of 1999.
The factory-supported <a href="Joest%20Racing">Joest Racing</a> team won at Le Mans three times in a row with the Audi R8 (2000–2002), as well as winning every race in the <a href="American%20Le%20Mans%20Series">American Le Mans Series</a> in its first year. Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as <a href="Champion%20Racing">Champion Racing</a>.

In 2003, two <a href="Bentley%20Speed%208">Bentley Speed 8</a>s, with engines designed by Audi, and driven by Joest drivers "loaned" to the fellow <a href="Volkswagen%20Group">Volkswagen Group</a> company, competed in the GTP class, and finished the race in the top two positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall, and first in the LMP900 class. Audi returned to the winner's podium at the 2004 race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing third.

At the <a href="2005%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">2005 24 Hours of Le Mans</a>, Champion Racing entered two R8s, along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team <a href="Oreca">Oreca</a>. The R8s (which were built to old LMP900 regulations) received a narrower air inlet restrictor, reducing power, and an additional of weight compared to the newer LMP1 chassis. On average, the R8s were about 2–3 seconds off pace compared to the <a href="Pescarolo%20Sport">Pescarolo</a>–<a href="Judd%20%28engine%29">Judd</a>. But with a team of excellent drivers and experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third, while the Oreca team took fourth. The Champion team was also the first American team to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GTs in 1967. This also ends the long era of the R8; however, its replacement for 2006, called the <a href="Audi%20R10%20TDI">Audi R10 TDI</a>, was unveiled on 13 December 2005.

The R10 <a href="Turbocharged%20Direct%20Injection">TDI</a> employed many new and innovative features, the most notable being the <a href="twin-turbo">twin-turbo</a>charged <a href="Direct%20fuel%20injection">direct injection</a> <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>. It was first raced in the <a href="2006%2012%20Hours%20of%20Sebring">2006 12 Hours of Sebring</a> as a race-test in preparation for the <a href="2006%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">2006 24 Hours of Le Mans</a>, which it later went on to win. Audi has been on the forefront of sports car racing, claiming a historic win in the first diesel sports car at 12 Hours of Sebring (the car was developed with a Diesel engine due to ACO regulations that favor diesel engines). As well as winning the <a href="24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> in 2006 making history, the R10 TDI has also shown its capabilities by beating the <a href="Peugeot%20908%20HDi%20FAP">Peugeot 908 HDi FAP</a> in , and beating Peugeot again in , (however Peugeot won the 24h in 2009) and, in a podium clean-sweep by proving its reliability throughout the race (compared to all four 908 entries retired before the end of the race) while breaking a new distance record (set way back by the <a href="Porsche%20917">Porsche 917</a>K of <a href="Martini%20Racing">Martini Racing</a> in ), in with the <a href="Audi%20R15%20TDI">R15 TDI Plus</a>.

Audi's sports car racing success would continue with the <a href="Audi%20R18">Audi R18</a>'s victory at the <a href="2011%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">2011 24 Hours of Le Mans</a>. <a href="Audi%20Sport%20Team%20Joest">Audi Sport Team Joest</a>'s <a href="Beno%C3%AEt%20Tr%C3%A9luyer">Benoît Tréluyer</a> earned Audi their first <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> in five years while the team's sister car locked out the front row. Early accidents eliminated two of Audi's three entries, but the sole remaining <a href="Audi%20R18%20TDI">Audi R18 TDI</a> of Tréluyer, <a href="Marcel%20F%C3%A4ssler%20%28racing%20driver%29">Marcel Fässler</a>, and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Lotterer">André Lotterer</a> held off the trio of <a href="Peugeot%20908">Peugeot 908</a>s to claim victory by a margin of 13.8 seconds.

Audi entered a factory racing team run by <a href="Joest%20Racing">Joest Racing</a> into the American Le Mans Series under the Audi Sport North America name in 2000. This was a successful operation with the team winning on its debut in the series at the 2000 12 Hours of Sebring. Factory backed Audi R8s were the dominant car in ALMS taking 25 victories between 2000 and the end of the 2002 season. In 2003 Audi sold customer cars to <a href="Champion%20Racing">Champion Racing</a> as well as continuing to race the factory Audi Sport North America team. Champion Racing won many races as a private team running Audi R8s and eventually replaced Team Joest as the Audi Sport North America between 2006 and 2008. Since 2009 Audi has not taken part in full American Le Mans Series Championships, but has competed in the series opening races at Sebring, using the 12-hour race as a test for Le Mans, and also as part of the <a href="2012%20FIA%20World%20Endurance%20Championship%20season">2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season</a> calendar.

Audi participated in the <a href="2003%201000km%20of%20Le%20Mans">2003 1000km of Le Mans</a> which was a one-off sports car race in preparation for the <a href="2004%20European%20Le%20Mans%20Series">2004 European Le Mans Series</a>. The factory team Audi Sport UK won races and the championship in the 2004 season but Audi was unable to match their sweeping success of Audi Sport North America in the American Le Mans Series, partly due to the arrival of a factory competitor in LMP1, Peugeot. The French manufacturer's <a href="Peugeot%20908%20HDi%20FAP">908 HDi FAP</a> became the car to beat in the series from 2008 onwards with 20 LMP wins. However, Audi were able to secure the championship in 2008 even though Peugeot scored more race victories in the season.

In 2012, the FIA sanctioned a <a href="FIA%20World%20Endurance%20Championship">World Endurance Championship</a> which would be organised by the ACO as a continuation of the ILMC. Audi competed won the first WEC race at Sebring and followed this up with a further three successive wins, including the <a href="2012%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">2012 24 Hours of Le Mans</a>. Audi scored a final 5th victory in the 2012 WEC in Bahrain and were able to win the inaugural WEC Manufacturers' Championship.

As defending champions, Audi once again entered the <a href="Audi%20R18">Audi R18 e-tron quattro</a> chassis into the <a href="2013%20FIA%20World%20Endurance%20Championship%20season">2013 WEC</a> and the team won the first five consecutive races, including the <a href="2013%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">2013 24 Hours of Le Mans</a>. The victory at Round 5, <a href="Circuit%20of%20the%20Americas">Circuit of the Americas</a>, was of particular significance as it marked the 100th win for Audi in Le Mans prototypes. Audi secured their second consecutive WEC Manufacturers' Championship at Round 6 after taking second place and half points in the red-flagged Fuji race.

For the 2014 season Audi entered a redesigned and upgraded R18 e-tron quattro which featured a 2 <a href="Megajoule">MJ</a> energy recovery system. As defending champions, Audi would once again face a challenge in <a href="LMP1">LMP1</a> from <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a>, and additionally from <a href="Porsche">Porsche</a> who returned to endurance racing after a 16-year absence. The season opening <a href="2014%206%20Hours%20of%20Silverstone">6hrs of Silverstone</a> was a disaster for Audi who saw both cars retire from the race, marking the first time that an Audi car has failed to score a podium in a <a href="FIA%20World%20Endurance%20Championship">World Endurance Championship</a> race.

Audi provide factory support to <a href="Abt%20Sportsline">Abt Sportsline</a> in the <a href="FIA%20Formula%20E%20Championship">FIA Formula E Championship</a>, The team competed under the title of Audi Sport Abt Formula E Team in the inaugural <a href="2014-15%20Formula%20E%20season">2014-15 Formula E season</a>. On 13 February 2014 the team announced its driver line up as <a href="Daniel%20Abt">Daniel Abt</a> and World Endurance Championship driver <a href="Lucas%20di%20Grassi">Lucas di Grassi</a>.

Audi has been linked to <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> in recent years but has always resisted due to the company's opinion that it is not relevant to road cars, but hybrid power unit technology has been adopted into the sport, swaying the company's view and encouraging research into the program by former <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> team principal <a href="Stefano%20Domenicali">Stefano Domenicali</a>.

The Audi emblem is four overlapping rings that represent the four <a href="marque">marque</a>s of Auto Union. The Audi emblem symbolises the amalgamation of Audi with DKW, Horch and Wanderer: the first ring from the left represents Audi, the second represents DKW, third is Horch, and the fourth and last ring Wanderer.
The design is popularly believed to have been the idea of <a href="Klaus%20von%20Oertzen">Klaus von Oertzen</a>, the director of sales at <a href="Wanderer%20%28car%29">Wanderer</a> - when <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> was chosen as the host city for the <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a> and that a form of the Olympic logo symbolized the newly established Auto Union's desire to succeed. Somewhat ironically, the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> later sued Audi in the International Trademark Court in 1995, where they lost.

The original "Audi" script, with the distinctive slanted tails on the "A" and "d" was created for the historic Audi company in 1920 by the famous graphic designer <a href="Lucian%20Bernhard">Lucian Bernhard</a>, and was resurrected when Volkswagen revived the brand in 1965. Following the demise of NSU in 1977, less prominence was given to the four rings, in preference to the "Audi" script encased within a black (later red) ellipse, and was commonly displayed next to the Volkswagen roundel when the two brands shared a dealer network under the V.A.G banner. The ellipse (known as the Audi Oval) was phased out after 1994, when Audi formed its own independent dealer network, and prominence was given back to the four rings - at the same time Audi Sans (a derivative of <a href="Univers">Univers</a>) was adopted as the font for all marketing materials, corporate communications and was also used in the vehicles themselves.

As part of Audi's centennial celebration in 2009, the company updated the logo, changing the <a href="font">font</a> to left-aligned Audi Type, and altering the shading for the overlapping rings. The revised logo was designed by Rayan Abdullah.

Audi developed a Corporate Sound concept, with Audi Sound Studio designed for producing the Corporate Sound. The Corporate Sound project began with sound agency Klangerfinder GmbH & Co KG and s12 GmbH. Audio samples were created in Klangerfinder's sound studio in Stuttgart, becoming part of Audi Sound Studio collection. Other Audi Sound Studio components include The Brand Music Pool, The Brand Voice. Audi also developed Sound Branding Toolkit including certain instruments, sound themes, rhythm and car sounds which all are supposed to reflect the AUDI sound character.

Audi started using a beating heart sound trademark beginning in 1996. An updated heartbeat sound logo, developed by agencies KLANGERFINDER GmbH & Co KG of Stuttgart and S12 GmbH of Munich, was first used in 2010 in an <a href="Audi%20A8">Audi A8</a> commercial with the slogan "The Art of Progress."

Audi's corporate <a href="tagline">tagline</a> is "<a href="Vorsprung%20durch%20Technik">Vorsprung durch Technik</a>", meaning ""Progress through Technology"". The German-language tagline is used in many European countries, including the United Kingdom, and in other markets, such as Latin America, Oceania and parts of Asia including Japan. A few years ago, the North American tagline was ""Innovation through technology"", but in Canada the German tagline "Vorsprung durch Technik" was used in advertising. Since 2007, Audi has used the slogan "Truth in Engineering" in the U.S. However, since the <a href="Volkswagen%20emissions%20violations">Audi emissions testing scandal</a> came to light in September 2015, this slogan was lambasted for being discordant with reality. In fact, just hours after disgraced Volkswagen CEO <a href="Martin%20Winterkorn">Martin Winterkorn</a> admitted to cheating on emissions data, an advertisement during the 2015 Primetime Emmy Awards promoted Audi's latest advances in low emissions technology with Kermit the Frog stating, "It's not that easy being green."

It was first used in English-language advertising after Sir John Hegarty of the <a href="Bartle%20Bogle%20Hegarty">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</a> advertising agency visited the Audi factory in 1982. In the original British television commercials, the phrase was voiced by <a href="Geoffrey%20Palmer%20%28actor%29">Geoffrey Palmer</a>. After its repeated use in advertising campaigns, the phrase found its way into popular culture, including the British comedy "<a href="Only%20Fools%20and%20Horses">Only Fools and Horses</a>", the <a href="U2">U2</a> song "<a href="Zooropa%20%28song%29">Zooropa</a>" and the <a href="Blur%20%28Blur%20album%29">Blur</a> song "<a href="Parklife%20%28song%29">Parklife</a>". Similar-sounding phrases have also been used, including as the punchline for a joke in the movie "<a href="Lock%2C%20Stock%2C%20and%20Two%20Smoking%20Barrels">Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</a>" and in the British TV series <a href="Peep%20Show%20%28TV%20series%29">Peep Show</a>.

Audi Sans (based on <a href="Univers">Univers</a> Extended) was originally created in 1997 by Ole Schäfer for <a href="MetaDesign">MetaDesign</a>. MetaDesign was later commissioned for a new corporate typeface called Audi Type, designed by Paul van der Laan and Pieter van Rosmalen of <a href="Bold%20Monday">Bold Monday</a>. The font began to appear in Audi's 2009 products and marketing materials.

Audi is a strong partner of different kinds of sports. In <a href="association%20football">football</a>, long partnerships exist between Audi and domestic clubs including <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>, <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>, and <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> and international clubs including <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a>, <a href="AFC%20Ajax">AFC Ajax</a> and <a href="Perspolis%20F.C.">Perspolis</a>. Audi also sponsors winter sports: The Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup is named after the company. Additionally, Audi supports the <a href="German%20Ski%20Association">German Ski Association</a> (DSV) as well as the alpine skiing national teams of Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, France, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria and the U.S. For almost two decades, Audi fosters golf sport: for example with the Audi quattro Cup and the HypoVereinsbank Ladies German Open presented by Audi. In sailing, Audi is engaged in the Medcup regatta and supports the team <a href="Luna%20Rossa%20Challenge">Luna Rossa</a> during the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series and also is the primary sponsor of the Melges 20 sailboat. Further, Audi sponsors the regional teams <a href="ERC%20Ingolstadt">ERC Ingolstadt</a> (hockey) and <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">FC Ingolstadt 04</a> (soccer). In 2009, the year of Audi's 100th anniversary, the company organized the <a href="Audi%20Cup">Audi Cup</a> for the first time. Audi also sponsor the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> as well. In October 2010 they agreed to a three sponsorship year-deal with <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. Audi also sponsors the England <a href="Polo">Polo</a> Team and holds the <a href="Audi%20Polo%20Awards">Audi Polo Awards</a>.

In 2001, Audi promoted the new <a href="multitronic">multitronic</a> <a href="continuously%20variable%20transmission">continuously variable transmission</a> with television commercials throughout Europe, featuring an impersonator of musician and actor <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. A <a href="prototypical">prototypical</a> dashboard figure – later named "<a href="Wackel-Elvis">Wackel-Elvis</a>" ("Wobble Elvis" or "Wobbly Elvis") – appeared in the commercials to demonstrate the smooth ride in an Audi equipped with the multitronic transmission. The dashboard figure was originally intended for use in the commercials only, but after they aired the demand for Wackel-Elvis fans grew among fans and the figure was mass-produced in China and marketed by Audi in their factory outlet store.

As part of Audi's attempt to promote its Diesel technology in 2009, the company began Audi Mileage Marathon. The driving tour featured a fleet of 23 Audi TDI vehicles from 4 models (<a href="Audi%20Q7">Audi Q7</a> 3.0 TDI, <a href="Audi%20Q5">Audi Q5</a> 3.0 TDI, <a href="Audi%20A4">Audi A4</a> 3.0 TDI, <a href="Audi%20A3">Audi A3</a> Sportback 2.0 TDI with S tronic transmission) travelling across the American continent from New York to Los Angeles, passing major cities like Chicago, Dallas and Las Vegas during the 13 daily stages, as well as natural wonders including the Rocky Mountains, Death Valley and the Grand Canyon.

As part of 2014 model year Audi TDI vehicles launch in the US, 3 television commercials ("The Station", "Future", "Range") were produced. In the 60-second 'The Station' ad, a woman at a fueling station reaches for the diesel pump to fill up her Audi A6. In a dramatic fashion, unsuspecting onlookers race towards her and they can't imagine the luxury vehicle is in fact a diesel. The spot ends with the tagline "It's time to rethink diesel – join the club." "The Station" appeared on primetime network and cable 2013 fall programming including Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Hostages, Sons of Anarchy and NBC NFL Sunday Night Football. The 15-second "Range" ad demonstrates the potential to drive from New York to Chicago on a single tank of gas, covering a range of approximately 790 miles. In the 15-second "Future" ad, viewers see the potential for clean diesel as today's leading alternative fuel solution and an intelligent choice for those on the leading-edge. Audi TDI provides drivers with 30% better fuel economy and range without compromises on performance and design. In addition to the three new television spots, Audi also tried to dispel the most common myths of diesel – gas station availability, the smell and perception associated with an older generation of diesel vehicles, weak performance – in a series of four online video shorts that would roll out over the next two months on the Audi YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/audiusa). The spots also will appear on The Washington Post and Slate.com in a custom user-generated content hub through 2013-10-31. In addition to standard and high-impact ads, the content hub features custom videos, articles and infographics, along with relevant social conversations. The Audi TDI clean diesel campaign also features print ads that reinforce the message "the future of fuel is here now." Print ads would roll out in select automotive buff books in fall 2013. 'The Station' ad was premiered in Canada in September 2013. 'The Station' (also called 'The Moment of Truth') ad was produced by Venables Bell & Partners, Biscuit Filmworks, Final Cut.

As part of 2014 model year Audi TDI vehicles launch in the US, the 'Truth in 48' driving challenge took place from Audi Pacific dealership at Los Angeles to New York in 48 hours or less, began at 9 a.m. PDT on 2013-09-07. The Coast-to-coast attempt used 2014 Audi A6 TDI and Audi A7 TDI and a 2014 Audi Q5 TDI crossover as the support vehicle, with teams of eight noted hypermilers and four journalists.

The next phase of technology Audi is developing is the <a href="Audi%20e-tron">e-tron</a> electric drive powertrain system. They have shown several concept cars , each with different levels of size and performance. The original e-tron concept shown at the 2009 <a href="Frankfurt%20motor%20show">Frankfurt motor show</a> is based on the platform of the R8 and has been scheduled for limited production. Power is provided by electric motors at all four wheels. The second concept was shown at the 2010 <a href="Detroit%20Motor%20Show">Detroit Motor Show</a>. Power is provided by two electric motors at the rear axle. This concept is also considered to be the direction for a future mid-engined gas-powered 2-seat performance coupe. The <a href="Audi%20A1">Audi A1</a> e-tron concept, based on the Audi A1 production model, is a <a href="hybrid%20vehicle">hybrid vehicle</a> with a range extending <a href="Wankel%20rotary%20engine">Wankel rotary engine</a> to provide power after the initial charge of the battery is depleted. It is the only concept of the three to have range extending capability. The car is powered through the front wheels, always using electric power.

It is all set to be displayed at the Auto Expo 2012 in New Delhi, India, from 5 January. Powered by a 1.4 litre engine, and can cover a distance up to 54 km s on a single charge. The e-tron was also shown in the 2013 blockbuster film Iron Man 3 and was driven by Tony Stark (Iron Man).

In <a href="PlayStation%20Home">PlayStation Home</a>, the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>'s online community-based service, Audi has supported Home by releasing a dedicated <a href="List%20of%20PlayStation%20Home%20Game%20Spaces%23Non-gaming%20Company%20Spaces">Home space</a> in the European version of Home. Audi is the first carmaker to develop a space for Home. On 17 December 2009, Audi released the Audi Space as two spaces; the Audi Home Terminal and the Audi Vertical Run. The Audi Home Terminal features an Audi TV channel delivering video content, an Internet Browser feature, and a view of a city. The Audi Vertical Run is where users can access the mini-game Vertical Run, a futuristic mini-game featuring Audi's e-tron concept. Players collect energy and race for the highest possible speeds and the fastest players earn a place in the Audi apartments located in a large tower in the centre of the Audi Space. In both the Home Terminal and Vertical Run spaces, there are teleports where users can teleport back and forth between the two spaces. Audi has stated that additional content will be added in 2010.

Aircraft

An aircraft is a <a href="machine">machine</a> that is able to <a href="flight">fly</a> by gaining support from the <a href="air">air</a>. It counters the force of gravity by using either <a href="Buoyancy">static lift</a> or by using the <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">dynamic lift</a> of an <a href="airfoil">airfoil</a>, or in a few cases the <a href="Powered%20lift">downward thrust</a> from <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a>s. Common examples of aircraft include <a href="airplane">airplane</a>s, <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s, <a href="airship">airship</a>s (including <a href="blimp">blimp</a>s), <a href="Glider%20%28aircraft%29">glider</a>s, and <a href="hot%20air%20balloon">hot air balloon</a>s. 

The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called "<a href="aviation">aviation</a>". <a href="Aircrew">Crewed</a> aircraft are flown by an onboard <a href="aviator">pilot</a>, but <a href="unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">unmanned aerial vehicle</a>s may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, <a href="Powered%20aircraft%23Methods%20of%20propulsion">aircraft propulsion</a>, usage and others.

Flying model craft and stories of manned <a href="flight">flight</a> go back many centuries, however the first manned ascent – and safe descent – in modern times took place by larger hot-air balloons developed in the 18th century. Each of the two World Wars led to great technical advances. Consequently, the history of aircraft can be divided into five eras:

<a href="Aerostat">Aerostat</a>s use <a href="buoyancy">buoyancy</a> to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water. They are characterized by one or more large gasbags or canopies, filled with a relatively low-density gas such as <a href="helium">helium</a>, <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, or <a href="hot%20air%20balloon">hot air</a>, which is less dense than the surrounding air. When the weight of this is added to the weight of the aircraft structure, it adds up to the same weight as the air that the craft displaces.

Small hot-air balloons called <a href="sky%20lantern">sky lantern</a>s were first invented in ancient China prior to the 3rd century BC and used primarily in cultural celebrations, and were only the second type of aircraft to fly, the first being <a href="kite">kite</a>s which were first invented in ancient China over two thousand years ago (see <a href="History%20of%20science%20and%20technology%20in%20China%23Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a>).
A <a href="Balloon%20%28aeronautics%29">balloon</a> was originally any aerostat, while the term <a href="airship">airship</a> was used for large, powered aircraft designs – usually fixed-wing. In 1919 <a href="Frederick%20Handley%20Page">Frederick Handley Page</a> was reported as referring to "ships of the air," with smaller passenger types as "Air yachts." In the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as "ships of the air" or "flying-ships". – though none had yet been built. The advent of powered balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size, began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a <a href="rigid%20airship">rigid</a> outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so "airship" came to be synonymous with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the <a href="Hindenburg%20disaster">Hindenburg disaster</a> in 1937, led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a "balloon" is an unpowered aerostat and an "airship" is a powered one.

A powered, steerable aerostat is called a "<a href="dirigible">dirigible</a>". Sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes "dirigible balloon" is regarded as the definition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back. These soon became known as "<a href="non-rigid%20airship">blimps</a>". During the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname "blimp" was adopted along with the shape. In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.

Heavier-than-air aircraft, such as <a href="airplane">airplane</a>s, must find some way to push air or gas downwards, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton's laws of motion) to push the aircraft upwards. This dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term "aerodyne". There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust: <a href="aerodynamics">aerodynamic lift</a>, and <a href="powered%20lift">powered lift</a> in the form of engine thrust.

Aerodynamic lift involving <a href="wing">wing</a>s is the most common, with <a href="fixed-wing%20aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a> being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings, and <a href="rotorcraft">rotorcraft</a> by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings. A wing is a flat, horizontal surface, usually shaped in cross-section as an <a href="airfoil">aerofoil</a>. To fly, air must flow over the wing and generate <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>. A "flexible wing" is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame. A "<a href="kite">kite</a>" is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid, fixed, or rotary.

With powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust <a href="vertical%20direction">vertically</a> downward. <a href="V/STOL">V/STOL</a> aircraft, such as the <a href="Harrier%20Jump%20Jet">Harrier Jump Jet</a> and <a href="F-35%20Lightning%20II%23F-35B">F-35B</a> take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.

A pure <a href="rocket">rocket</a> is not usually regarded as an aerodyne, because it does not depend on the air for its lift (and can even fly into space); however, many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors. Rocket-powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are a marginal case.

The forerunner of the fixed-wing aircraft is the <a href="kite">kite</a>. Whereas a fixed-wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings, a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the <a href="wind">wind</a> blowing over its wings to provide lift. Kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly, and <a href="History%20of%20science%20and%20technology%20in%20China">were invented in China</a> around 500 BC. Much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft, wind tunnels, and computer modelling programs became available.

The first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free-flight were <a href="glider%20%28aircraft%29">gliders</a>. A glider designed by <a href="George%20Cayley">Cayley</a> carried out the first true manned, controlled flight in 1853.

Practical, powered, fixed-wing aircraft (the <a href="aeroplane">aeroplane</a> or airplane) were invented by <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wilbur and Orville Wright</a>. Besides the method of <a href="%23Propulsion">propulsion</a>, fixed-wing aircraft are in general characterized by their <a href="wing%20configuration">wing configuration</a>. The most important wing characteristics are:

A <a href="Wing%20configuration%23Variable%20geometry">variable geometry</a> aircraft can change its wing configuration during flight.

A "<a href="flying%20wing">flying wing</a>" has no fuselage, though it may have small blisters or pods. The opposite of this is a "<a href="lifting%20body">lifting body</a>", which has no wings, though it may have small stabilizing and control surfaces.

<a href="wing-In-Ground%20effect%20vehicle">Wing-in-ground-effect</a> vehicles are not considered aircraft. They "fly" efficiently close to the surface of the ground or water, like conventional aircraft during takeoff. An example is the Russian ekranoplan (nicknamed the "Caspian Sea Monster"). <a href="Human-powered%20flight">Man-powered aircraft</a> also rely on <a href="ground%20effect%20in%20aircraft">ground effect</a> to remain airborne with a minimal pilot power, but this is only because they are so underpowered—in fact, the airframe is capable of flying higher.

Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a spinning rotor with aerofoil section blades (a "rotary wing") to provide lift. Types include <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s, <a href="autogyro">autogyro</a>s, and various hybrids such as <a href="gyrodyne">gyrodyne</a>s and compound rotorcraft.

"<a href="Helicopter">Helicopter</a>s" have a rotor turned by an engine-driven shaft. The rotor pushes air downward to create lift. By tilting the rotor forward, the downward flow is tilted backward, producing thrust for forward flight. Some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips.

"<a href="Autogyro">Autogyro</a>s" have unpowered rotors, with a separate power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning increases the speed of airflow over the rotor, to provide lift. <a href="Rotor%20kite">Rotor kite</a>s are unpowered autogyros, which are towed to give them forward speed or tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited flight.

"<a href="Cyclogyro">Cyclogyro</a>s" rotate their wings about a horizontal axis.

"Compound rotorcraft" have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward flight. They are nowadays classified as "<a href="powered%20lift">powered lift</a>" types and not as rotorcraft. "<a href="Tiltrotor">Tiltrotor</a>" aircraft (such as the <a href="V-22%20Osprey">V-22 Osprey</a>), <a href="tiltwing">tiltwing</a>, <a href="tailsitter">tailsitter</a>, and <a href="coleopter">coleopter</a> aircraft have their rotors/<a href="Propeller%20%28aircraft%29">propellers</a> horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight.


The smallest aircraft are toys, and—even smaller -- <a href="nano-aircraft">nano-aircraft</a>.

The largest aircraft by dimensions and volume (as of 2016) is the 302-foot-long (about 95 meters) British <a href="Airlander%2010">Airlander 10</a>, a hybrid blimp, with helicopter and fixed-wing features, and reportedly capable of speeds up to 90 mph (about 150 km/h), and an airborne endurance of two weeks with a payload of up to 22,050 pounds (11 tons).

The largest aircraft by weight and largest regular fixed-wing aircraft ever built (as of 2016), is the <a href="Antonov%20An-225">Antonov An-225</a>. That Ukrainian-built 6-engine Russian transport of the 1980s is 84 metres (276 feet) long, with an 88-meter (289 foot) wingspan. It holds the world payload record, after transporting 428,834 pounds (200 tons) of goods, and has recently flown 100-ton loads commercially. Weighing in at somewhere between 1.1 and 1.4 million pounds (550-700 tons) maximum loaded weight, it is also the heaviest aircraft to be built, to date. It can cruise at 500 mph.

The largest military airplanes are the Ukrainian/Russian <a href="Antonov%20An-124">Antonov An-124</a> (world's second-largest airplane, also used as a civilian transport), and American <a href="Lockheed%20C-5%20Galaxy">Lockheed C-5 Galaxy</a> transport, weighing, loaded, over 765,000 pounds (over 380 tons). The 8-engine, piston/propeller Hughes HK-1 "<a href="Spruce%20Goose">Spruce Goose</a>," an American <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> wooden flying boat transport—with a greater wingspan (94 meters / 260 feet) than any current aircraft, and a tail-height equal to the tallest (Airbus A380-800 at 24.1 meters / 78 feet) -- flew only one short hop in the late 1940s, and never flew out of <a href="Ground%20effect%20%28aerodynamics%29">ground effect</a>.

The largest civilian airplanes, apart from the above-noted An-225 and An-124, are the French <a href="Airbus%20Beluga">Airbus Beluga</a> cargo transport derivative of the <a href="Airbus%20A300">Airbus A300</a> jet airliner, the American <a href="Boeing%20Dreamlifter">Boeing Dreamlifter</a> cargo transport derivative of the <a href="Boeing%20747">Boeing 747</a> jet airliner/transport (the 747-200B was, at its creation in the 1960s, the heaviest aircraft ever built, with a maximum weight of 836,000 pounds (over 400 tons)), and the double-decker French <a href="Airbus%20A380">Airbus A380</a> "super-jumbo" jet airliner (the world's largest passenger airliner).

The fastest recorded powered aircraft flight and fastest recorded aircraft flight of an air-breathing powered aircraft was of the NASA <a href="X-43A">X-43A</a> Pegasus, a <a href="scramjet">scramjet</a>-powered, <a href="hypersonic">hypersonic</a>, <a href="lifting%20body">lifting body</a> experimental research aircraft, at Mach 9.6 (nearly 7,000 mph). The X-43A set that new mark, and broke its own world record (of Mach 6.3, nearly 5,000 mph, set in March, 2004) on its third and final flight on Nov. 16, 2004.

Prior to the X-43A, the fastest recorded powered airplane flight (and still the record for the fastest manned, powered airplane / fastest manned, non-spacecraft aircraft) was of the North American <a href="X-15A-2">X-15A-2</a>, rocket-powered airplane at 4,520 mph (7,274 km/h), Mach 6.72, on October 3, 1967. On one flight it reached an altitude of 354,300 feet.

The fastest known, production aircraft (other than rockets and missiles) currently or formerly operational (as of 2016) are:




<a href="Glider%20%28aircraft%29">Gliders</a> are heavier-than-air aircraft that do not employ propulsion once airborne. Take-off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location, or by pulling into the air on a tow-line, either by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a powered "tug" aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Many gliders can 'soar' – gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. The first practical, controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and pioneer <a href="George%20Cayley">George Cayley</a>, whom many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer. Common examples of gliders are <a href="Glider%20%28sailplane%29">sailplanes</a>, <a href="hang%20glider">hang glider</a>s and <a href="paraglider">paraglider</a>s.

<a href="Balloon%20%28aircraft%29">Balloons</a> drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude, either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude). A wing-shaped hybrid balloon can glide directionally when rising or falling; but a spherically shaped balloon does not have such directional control.

<a href="Kite">Kite</a>s are aircraft that are tethered to the ground or other object (fixed or mobile) that maintains tension in the tether or <a href="kite%20line">kite line</a>; they rely on virtual or real wind blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag. <a href="Kytoon">Kytoon</a>s are balloon-kite hybrids that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than-air.

Powered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power, typically <a href="aircraft%20engine">aircraft engine</a>s although rubber and manpower have also been used. Most aircraft engines are either lightweight <a href="piston%20engine">piston engine</a>s or <a href="gas%20turbine">gas turbine</a>s. Engine fuel is stored in tanks, usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional <a href="fuel%20tank">fuel tank</a>s in the <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a>.

<a href="Propeller%20aircraft">Propeller aircraft</a> use one or more <a href="Propeller%20%28aircraft%29">propellers</a> (airscrews) to create thrust in a forward direction. The propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in "<a href="tractor%20configuration">tractor configuration</a>" but can be mounted behind in "<a href="pusher%20configuration">pusher configuration</a>". Variations of propeller layout include "<a href="contra-rotating%20propellers">contra-rotating propellers</a>" and "<a href="ducted%20fan">ducted fan</a>s".

Many kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers. Early airships used man power or <a href="steam%20aircraft">steam engines</a>. The more practical <a href="Internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion piston engine</a> was used for virtually all fixed-wing aircraft until <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and is still used in many smaller aircraft. Some types use turbine engines to drive a propeller in the form of a <a href="turboprop">turboprop</a> or <a href="propfan">propfan</a>. <a href="Human-powered%20flight">Human-powered flight</a> has been achieved, but has not become a practical means of transport. Unmanned aircraft and models have also used power sources such as <a href="Electric%20aircraft">electric motors</a> and rubber bands.

<a href="Jet%20aircraft">Jet aircraft</a> use <a href="airbreathing%20jet%20engine">airbreathing jet engine</a>s, which take in air, burn fuel with it in a <a href="combustion%20chamber">combustion chamber</a>, and accelerate the exhaust rearwards to provide thrust.

<a href="Turbojet">Turbojet</a> and <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> engines use a spinning turbine to drive one or more fans, which provide additional thrust. An <a href="afterburner">afterburner</a> may be used to inject extra fuel into the hot exhaust, especially on military "fast jets". Use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary: other designs include the <a href="pulse%20jet%20engine">pulse jet</a> and <a href="ramjet">ramjet</a>. These mechanically simple designs cannot work when stationary, so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed by some other method. Other variants have also been used, including the <a href="motorjet">motorjet</a> and hybrids such as the <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20J58">Pratt & Whitney J58</a>, which can convert between turbojet and ramjet operation.

Compared to propellers, jet engines can provide much higher thrust, higher speeds and, above about , greater efficiency. They are also much more fuel-efficient than <a href="rocket">rocket</a>s. As a consequence nearly all large, high-speed or high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.

Some rotorcraft, such as <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s, have a powered rotary wing or "rotor", where the rotor disc can be angled slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed forwards. The rotor may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as a piston engine or turbine. Experiments have also used <a href="Tip%20jet">jet nozzles at the rotor blade tips</a>.


Aircraft are <a href="aircraft%20design%20process">designed</a> according to many factors such as customer and manufacturer demand, <a href="air%20safety">safety</a> protocols and physical and economic constraints. For many types of aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities.

The key parts of an aircraft are generally divided into three categories:

The approach to structural design varies widely between different types of aircraft. Some, such as <a href="paraglider">paraglider</a>s, comprise only flexible materials that act in tension and rely on aerodynamic pressure to hold their shape. A <a href="balloon">balloon</a> similarly relies on internal gas pressure but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry its payload. Early aircraft, including <a href="airship">airship</a>s, often employed flexible <a href="aircraft%20dope">doped</a> <a href="aircraft%20fabric%20covering">aircraft fabric covering</a> to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame. Later aircraft employed semi-<a href="monocoque">monocoque</a> techniques, where the skin of the aircraft is stiff enough to share much of the flight loads. In a true monocoque design there is no internal structure left.

The key structural parts of an aircraft depend on what type it is.

Lighter-than-air types are characterised by one or more gasbags, typically with a supporting structure of flexible cables or a rigid framework called its hull. Other elements such as engines or a gondola may also be attached to the supporting structure.

Heavier-than-air types are characterised by one or more wings and a central <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a>. The fuselage typically also carries a tail or <a href="empennage">empennage</a> for stability and control, and an undercarriage for takeoff and landing. Engines may be located on the fuselage or wings. On a <a href="fixed-wing%20aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a> the wings are rigidly attached to the fuselage, while on a <a href="rotorcraft">rotorcraft</a> the wings are attached to a rotating vertical shaft. Smaller designs sometimes use flexible materials for part or all of the structure, held in place either by a rigid frame or by air pressure. The fixed parts of the structure comprise the <a href="airframe">airframe</a>.

The avionics comprise the <a href="flight%20control%20system">flight control system</a>s and related equipment, including the <a href="cockpit">cockpit</a> instrumentation, navigation, <a href="radar">radar</a>, monitoring, and <a href="communication%20system">communication system</a>s.

The flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its capabilities in terms of <a href="airspeed">airspeed</a> and <a href="Load%20factor%20%28aeronautics%29">load factor</a> or altitude. The term can also refer to other measurements such as maneuverability. When a craft is pushed, for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown "outside the envelope", something considered unsafe.

The range is the distance an aircraft can fly between <a href="takeoff">takeoff</a> and <a href="landing">landing</a>, as limited by the time it can remain airborne.

For a powered aircraft the time limit is determined by the fuel load and rate of consumption.

For an unpowered aircraft, the maximum flight time is limited by factors such as weather conditions and pilot endurance. Many aircraft types are restricted to daylight hours, while balloons are limited by their supply of lifting gas. The range can be seen as the average ground speed multiplied by the maximum time in the air.

Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the <a href="angles%20of%20rotation">angles of rotation</a> around <a href="Aircraft%20axis">three axes</a> about the vehicle's <a href="center%20of%20mass">center of mass</a>, known as "pitch", "roll", and "yaw" (quite different from their use as <a href="Tait-Bryan%20angles">Tait-Bryan angles</a>).


Flight dynamics is concerned with the stability and control of an aircraft's rotation about each of these axes.

An aircraft that is unstable tends to diverge from its current flight path and so is difficult to fly. A very stable aircraft tends to stay on its current flight path and is difficult to manoeuvre—so it is important for any design to achieve the desired degree of stability. Since the widespread use of digital computers, it is increasingly common for designs to be inherently unstable and rely on computerised control systems to provide artificial stability.

A fixed wing is typically unstable in pitch, roll, and yaw. Pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional fixed wing designs require <a href="stabilizer%20%28aircraft%29">horizontal and vertical stabilisers</a>, which act similarly to the feathers on an arrow. These stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the <a href="flight%20dynamics">flight dynamics</a> of <a href="pitch%20%28flight%29">pitch</a> and <a href="yaw%20angle">yaw</a>. They are usually mounted on the tail section (<a href="empennage">empennage</a>), although in the <a href="Canard%20%28aeronautics%29">canard</a> layout, the main aft wing replaces the canard foreplane as pitch stabilizer. <a href="Tandem%20wing">Tandem wing</a> and <a href="Tailless%20aircraft">Tailless aircraft</a> rely on the same general rule to achieve stability, the aft surface being the stabilising one.

A rotary wing is typically unstable in yaw, requiring a vertical stabiliser.

A balloon is typically very stable in pitch and roll due to the way the payload is hung underneath.

<a href="Flight%20control%20surfaces">Flight control surfaces</a> enable the pilot to control an aircraft's <a href="Aircraft%20attitude">flight attitude</a> and are usually part of the wing or mounted on, or integral with, the associated stabilizing surface. Their development was a critical advance in the history of aircraft, which had until that point been uncontrollable in flight.

<a href="Aerospace%20engineer">Aerospace engineer</a>s develop <a href="control%20system">control system</a>s for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its <a href="center%20of%20mass">center of mass</a>. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or <a href="moment%20%28physics%29">moment</a>s about the <a href="aerodynamic%20center">aerodynamic center</a> of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw. For example, a <a href="pitching%20moment">pitching moment</a> is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down. Control systems are also sometimes used to increase or decrease drag, for example to slow the aircraft to a safe speed for landing.

The two main aerodynamic forces acting on any aircraft are lift supporting it in the air and <a href="Drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a> opposing its motion. Control surfaces or other techniques may also be used to affect these forces directly, without inducing any rotation.

Aircraft permit long distance, high speed <a href="Air%20travel">travel</a> and may be a more <a href="Fuel%20efficiency%20in%20transportation%23Aircraft">fuel efficient</a> mode of transportation in some circumstances. Aircraft have <a href="Environmental%20impact%20of%20aviation">environmental and climate impacts</a> beyond fuel efficiency considerations, however. They are also relatively <a href="aircraft%20noise">noisy</a> compared to other forms of travel and high altitude aircraft generate <a href="contrail">contrail</a>s, which experimental evidence suggests may <a href="global%20dimming">alter weather patterns</a>.

Aircraft are produced in several different types optimized for various uses; <a href="military%20aircraft">military aircraft</a>, which includes not just combat types but many types of supporting aircraft, and <a href="civil%20aviation">civil aircraft</a>, which include all non-military types, experimental and model.

A military aircraft is any aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type. Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:

Most military aircraft are powered heavier-than-air types. Other types such as gliders and <a href="balloon">balloon</a>s have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and <a href="military%20glider">military glider</a>s were used during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> to land troops.

Civil aircraft divide into "commercial" and "general" types, however there are some overlaps.

<a href="Commercial%20aviation">Commercial aircraft</a> include types designed for scheduled and charter airline flights, carrying passengers, <a href="Airmail">mail</a> and other <a href="cargo">cargo</a>. The larger passenger-carrying types are the airliners, the largest of which are <a href="wide-body%20aircraft">wide-body aircraft</a>. Some of the smaller types are also used in <a href="general%20aviation">general aviation</a>, and some of the larger types are used as <a href="Air%20transports%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20and%20government">VIP aircraft</a>.

<a href="General%20aviation">General aviation</a> is a catch-all covering other kinds of <a href="Private%20aviation">private</a> (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial use, and involving a wide range of aircraft types such as <a href="Business%20jet">business jets (bizjets)</a>, <a href="Trainer%20%28aircraft%29">trainers</a>, <a href="Homebuilt%20aircraft">homebuilt</a>, <a href="glider%20%28aircraft%29">gliders</a>, <a href="warbird">warbird</a>s and <a href="hot%20air%20balloon">hot air balloon</a>s to name a few. The vast majority of aircraft today are general aviation types.

An experimental aircraft is one that has not been fully proven in flight, or that carries an FAA airworthiness certificate in the "Experimental" category. Often, this implies that the aircraft is testing new aerospace technologies, though the term also refers to amateur and kit-built aircraft—many based on proven designs.

A model aircraft is a small unmanned type made to fly for fun, for static display, for aerodynamic research or for other purposes. A <a href="scale%20model">scale model</a> is a replica of some larger design.

Alfred Nobel

Alfred Bernhard Nobel (; ; 21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist.

Known for inventing <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a>, Nobel also owned <a href="Bofors">Bofors</a>, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. After reading a <a href="premature%20obituary">premature obituary</a> which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms, he bequeathed his fortune to institute the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>s. The synthetic element <a href="nobelium">nobelium</a> was named after him. His name also survives in modern-day companies such as <a href="Dynamit%20Nobel">Dynamit Nobel</a> and <a href="AkzoNobel">AkzoNobel</a>, which are descendants of mergers with companies Nobel himself established.

Born in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Alfred Nobel was the third son of <a href="Immanuel%20Nobel">Immanuel Nobel</a> (1801–1872), an inventor and engineer, and Carolina Andriette (Ahlsell) Nobel (1805–1889). The couple married in 1827 and had eight children. The family was impoverished, and only Alfred and his three brothers survived past childhood. Through his father, Alfred Nobel was a descendant of the Swedish scientist <a href="Olaus%20Rudbeck">Olaus Rudbeck</a> (1630–1702), and in his turn the boy was interested in engineering, particularly explosives, learning the basic principles from his father at a young age. Alfred Nobel's interest in technology was inherited from his father, an alumnus of <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Royal Institute of Technology</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>.

Following various business failures, Nobel's father moved to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> in 1837 and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives. He invented modern <a href="plywood">plywood</a> and started work on the <a href="naval%20mine">torpedo</a>. In 1842, the family joined him in the city. Now prosperous, his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies, particularly in chemistry and languages, achieving fluency in <a href="English%20language">English</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a> and <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>. For 18 months, from 1841 to 1842, Nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child, the Jacobs Apologistic School in Stockholm.

As a young man, Nobel studied with chemist <a href="Nikolai%20Nikolaevich%20Zinin">Nikolai Zinin</a>; then, in 1850, went to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to further the work. There he met <a href="Ascanio%20Sobrero">Ascanio Sobrero</a>, who had invented <a href="nitroglycerin">nitroglycerin</a> three years before. Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin, as it was unpredictable, exploding when subjected to heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive, as it had much more power than <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a>. At age 18, he went to the United States for one year to study chemistry, working for a short period under inventor <a href="John%20Ericsson">John Ericsson</a>, who designed the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> ironclad "<a href="USS%20Monitor">USS Monitor</a>". Nobel filed his first patent, an English patent for a <a href="gas%20meter">gas meter</a>, in 1857, while his first Swedish patent, which he received in 1863, was on 'ways to prepare gunpowder'.

The family factory produced armaments for the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> (1853–1856), but had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy. In 1859, Nobel's father left his factory in the care of the second son, <a href="Ludvig%20Nobel">Ludvig Nobel</a> (1831–1888), who greatly improved the business. Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of explosives, and especially to the safe manufacture and use of <a href="nitroglycerin">nitroglycerin</a>. Nobel invented a detonator in 1863, and in 1865 designed the <a href="blasting%20cap">blasting cap</a>.

On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in <a href="Heleneborg">Heleneborg</a>, Stockholm, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother <a href="Emil%20Oskar%20Nobel">Emil</a>. Dogged and unfazed by more minor accidents, Nobel went on to build further factories, focusing on improving the stability of the explosives he was developing. Nobel invented <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a> in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable <a href="nitroglycerin">nitroglycerin</a>. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally. In 1875 Nobel invented <a href="gelignite">gelignite</a>, more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887 patented <a href="ballistite">ballistite</a>, a predecessor of <a href="cordite">cordite</a>.

Nobel was elected a member of the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an <a href="honorary%20doctorate">honorary doctorate</a> from <a href="Uppsala%20University">Uppsala University</a> in 1893.
Nobel's brothers Ludvig and Robert exploited oilfields along the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> and became hugely rich in their own right. Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions. During his life Nobel was issued 355 <a href="patent">patent</a>s internationally and by his death his business had established more than 90 armaments factories, despite his belief in pacifism.

In 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of Alfred in error. A French obituary stated "Le marchand de la mort est mort" "("The merchant of death is dead")".

Accused of “high treason against France” for selling <a href="Ballistite">Ballistite</a> to Italy, Nobel moved from Paris to <a href="Sanremo">Sanremo</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in 1891. On December 10, 1896, Alfred Nobel succumbed to a lingering heart ailment, suffered a stroke, and died. Unbeknownst to his family, friends or colleagues, he had left most of his wealth in trust, in order to fund the awards that would become known as the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>s. He is buried in <a href="Norra%20begravningsplatsen">Norra begravningsplatsen</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>.

Through baptism and confirmation Alfred Nobel was Lutheran and during his Paris years he regularly attended the <a href="Church%20of%20Sweden%20Abroad">Church of Sweden Abroad</a>, led by pastor <a href="Nathan%20S%C3%B6derblom">Nathan Söderblom</a>, who would in 1930 also be the recipient of the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>. However, he became an agnostic at youth and was an atheist later in life.

Nobel travelled for much of his business life, maintaining companies in various countries in Europe and North America and keeping a permanent home in Paris from 1873 to 1891. He remained a solitary character, given to periods of depression. Though Nobel remained unmarried, his biographers note that he had at least three loves. Nobel's first love was in Russia with a girl named Alexandra, who rejected his proposal. In 1876 <a href="Austria">Austro</a>-<a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n <a href="Freifrau">Countess</a> <a href="Bertha%20von%20Suttner">Bertha Kinsky</a> became Alfred Nobel's secretary, but after only a brief stay she left him to marry her previous lover, Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner. Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. <a href="Bertha%20von%20Suttner">Bertha von Suttner</a> was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize, 'for her sincere peace activities'.

Nobel's third and longest-lasting relationship was with Sofie Hess from <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, whom he met in 1876. The liaison lasted for 18 years. After his death, according to his biographers Evlanoff, Fluor and Fant, Nobel's letters were locked within the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. They were released only in 1955, to be included with other biographical data.

Despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education, Nobel gained proficiency in six languages: <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a>, French, Russian, English, German and <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>. He also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in English. His "<a href="Nemesis%20%28Nobel%20play%29">Nemesis</a>", a prose tragedy in four acts about <a href="Beatrice%20Cenci">Beatrice Cenci</a>, partly inspired by <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cenci">The Cenci</a>", was printed while he was dying. The entire stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual Swedish–<a href="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has been translated into <a href="Slovenian%20language">Slovenian</a> via the Esperanto version and into French. In 2010 it was published in Russia in another bilingual (<a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>–Esperanto) edition.

Nobel found that when <a href="nitroglycerin">nitroglycerin</a> was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like "kieselguhr" (<a href="diatomaceous%20earth">diatomaceous earth</a>) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as "dynamite". Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in <a href="Redhill%2C%20Surrey">Redhill</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance "Nobel's Safety Powder", but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word for "power" ().

Nobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to <a href="collodion">collodion</a>, but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. '<a href="Gelignite">Gelignite</a>', or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the "Age of Engineering" bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of <a href="ballistite">ballistite</a>, the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.

In 1888 Alfred's brother Ludvig died while visiting <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a> and a <a href="France">French</a> newspaper erroneously published Alfred's <a href="List%20of%20premature%20obituaries">obituary</a>. It condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death. The obituary stated, "" ("The merchant of death is dead") and went on to say, "Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday." Alfred (who never had a wife or children) was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered.

On 27 November 1895, at the <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a>-<a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>s, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel's will allocated 94% of his total assets, 31,225,000 <a href="Swedish%20kronor">Swedish kronor</a>, to establish the five Nobel Prizes. This converted to £1,687,837 (GBP) at the time. In 2012, the capital was worth around SEK 3.1 billion (USD 472 million, EUR 337 million), which is almost twice the amount of the initial capital, taking inflation into account.

The first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">in physical science</a>, <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">in chemistry</a> and <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">in medical science or physiology</a>; the fourth is <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20for%20Literature">for literary work</a> "in an ideal direction" and <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">the fifth prize</a> is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international <a href="wikt%3Afraternity">fraternity</a>, in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses. 

The formulation for the literary prize being given for a work "in an ideal direction" (' in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted "ideal" as "idealistic" (') and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors, such as <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a> and <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, <a href="Dario%20Fo">Dario Fo</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Saramago">José Saramago</a>, who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.

There was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors.

In 2001, Alfred Nobel's great-great-nephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given "in Alfred Nobel's memory" from the five other awards. This request added to the controversy over whether the <a href="Bank%20of%20Sweden%20Prize%20in%20Economic%20Sciences%20in%20Memory%20of%20Alfred%20Nobel">Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel</a> is actually a legitimate "Nobel Prize".

The "Monument to Alfred Nobel" (, ) in Saint Petersburg is located along the <a href="Bolshaya%20Nevka%20River">Bolshaya Nevka River</a> on Petrogradskaya Embankment. It was dedicated in 1991 to mark the 90th anniversary of the first <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> presentation. Diplomat <a href="http%3A//www.cyclopaedia.info/wiki/Tomas-Bertelman">Thomas Bertelman</a> and Professor <a href="Arkady%20Melua">Arkady Melua</a> initiators of creation of the monument (1989). Professor A. Melua has provided funds for the establishment of the monument (<a href="http%3A//humanistica.ru/pages_en/news_nobeldv.htm">J.S.Co. "Humanistica"</a>, 1990–1991). The abstract metal sculpture was designed by local artists Sergey Alipov and Pavel Shevchenko, and appears to be an explosion or branches of a tree. Petrogradskaya Embankment is the street where the Nobel's family lived until 1859.

Criticism of Nobel focuses on his leading role in weapons manufacturing and sales, and some question his motives in creating his prizes, suggesting they were intended to improve his reputation.

Alexander Graham Bell

Alexander Graham Bell (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was a <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a>-born scientist, inventor, engineer, and innovator who is credited with patenting the first practical <a href="telephone">telephone</a> and founding the <a href="American%20Telephone%20and%20Telegraph%20Company">American Telephone and Telegraph Company</a> (AT&T) in 1885.

Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on <a href="elocution">elocution</a> and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first <a href="United%20States%20patent%20law">U.S. patent</a> for the telephone in 1876. Bell considered his most famous invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.

Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in <a href="Free-space%20optical%20communication">optical telecommunications</a>, <a href="hydrofoil">hydrofoil</a>s, and <a href="aeronautics">aeronautics</a>. Although Bell was not one of the 33 founders of the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a>, he had a strong influence on the magazine while serving as the second president from January 7, 1898, until 1903.

Alexander Bell was born in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland, on March 3, 1847. The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as Alexander Graham Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845–70) and Edward Charles Bell (1848–67), both of whom would die of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. His father was Professor <a href="Alexander%20Melville%20Bell">Alexander Melville Bell</a>, a <a href="phonetics">phonetician</a>, and his mother was Eliza Grace (née Symonds). Born as just "Alexander Bell", at age 10, he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers. For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the name "Graham", chosen out of respect for Alexander Graham, a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> being treated by his father who had become a family friend. To close relatives and friends he remained "Aleck".

As a child, young Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age. His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbour whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays. Young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill. He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years. In return, Ben's father John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to "invent".

From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist. Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he revelled in mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to <a href="ventriloquism">ventriloquism</a> that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits. Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12), and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour. He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity. Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study <a href="acoustics">acoustics</a>.

His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his "The Standard Elocutionist" (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. "The Standard Elocutionist" appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct <a href="deaf-mute">deaf-mute</a>s (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write <a href="Visible%20Speech">Visible Speech</a> but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound. Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a>, and even <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.

As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, he was enrolled at the <a href="Royal%20High%20School%20%28Edinburgh%29">Royal High School</a>, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at the age of 15, having completed only the first four forms. His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father. Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself. At the age of 16, Bell secured a position as a "pupil-teacher" of <a href="elocution">elocution</a> and music, in Weston House Academy at <a href="Elgin%2C%20Moray">Elgin, Moray</a>, Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session. The following year, he attended the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year. In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family, Bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a>.

His father encouraged Bell's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique <a href="automaton">automaton</a> developed by Sir <a href="Charles%20Wheatstone">Charles Wheatstone</a> based on the earlier work of <a href="Wolfgang%20von%20Kempelen">Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen</a>. The rudimentary "mechanical man" simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful. While his brother constructed the throat and <a href="larynx">larynx</a>, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could "speak", albeit only a few words. The boys would carefully adjust the "lips" and when a <a href="bellows">bellows</a> forced air through the <a href="Vertebrate%20trachea">windpipe</a>, a very recognizable "Mama" ensued, to the delight of neighbours who came to see the Bell invention.

Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's <a href="Skye%20Terrier">Skye Terrier</a>, "Trouve". After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and <a href="Vocal%20folds">vocal cords</a> to produce a crude-sounding "Ow ah oo ga ma ma". With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate "How are you, grandma?" Indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a "talking dog". These initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using <a href="tuning%20fork">tuning fork</a>s to explore <a href="resonance">resonance</a>.

At age 19, Bell wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist <a href="Alexander%20John%20Ellis">Alexander Ellis</a>, a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28play%29">Pygmalion</a>"). Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of <a href="Hermann%20von%20Helmholtz">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>'s work, "The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music".

Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork "contraption", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: "Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech." He also later remarked: "I thought that Helmholtz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!"

In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London, Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a> wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend. Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward "Ted," was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as "A. G. Bell") and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a>, Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.

Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, London. His first two pupils were <a href="deaf-mute">deaf-mute</a> girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland</a>. Bell's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property, conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp), and join his father and mother in setting out for the "<a href="New%20World">New World</a>". Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.

In 1870, aged 23, Bell, together with Bell's brother's widow, Caroline Margaret Ottaway, and his parents travelled on the SS "Nestorian" to Canada. After landing at <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>, the Bells transferred to another steamer to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> and then boarded a train to <a href="Paris%2C%20Ontario">Paris, Ontario</a>, to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson, a family friend. After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a farm of at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a>, Ontario. The property consisted of an orchard, large farmhouse, stable, pigsty, hen-house, and a <a href="carriage%20house">carriage house</a>, which bordered the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Grand River</a>.

At the homestead, Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his "dreaming place", a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river. Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly improved. He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the <a href="Six%20Nations%2040%2C%20Ontario">Six Nations Reserve</a> across the river at <a href="Onondaga%20%28village%29">Onondaga</a>, he learned the <a href="Mohawk%20language">Mohawk language</a> and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols. For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a <a href="Mohawk%20nation">Mohawk</a> headdress and danced traditional dances.

After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtz's work with electricity and sound. He also modified a <a href="Pump%20organ">melodeon</a> (a type of pump organ) so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance. Once the family was settled in, both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where Melville was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.

Bell's father was invited by Sarah Fuller, principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public <a href="Horace%20Mann%20School%20for%20the%20Deaf%20and%20Hard%20of%20Hearing">Horace Mann School for the Deaf</a>), in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post in favour of his son. Travelling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors. He was subsequently asked to repeat the programme at the <a href="American%20School%20for%20the%20Deaf">American Asylum for Deaf-mutes</a> in <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>, and the <a href="Clarke%20School%20for%20the%20Deaf">Clarke School for the Deaf</a> in <a href="Northampton%2C%20Massachusetts">Northampton, Massachusetts</a>.

Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his "harmonic telegraph". The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.

Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher. His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting <a href="Gardiner%20Greene%20Hubbard">Gardiner Greene Hubbard</a>, the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October 1872, Alexander Bell opened his "School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech" in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils, with his first class numbering 30 students. While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was <a href="Helen%20Keller">Helen Keller</a>, who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak. She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that "inhuman silence which separates and estranges". In 1893, Keller performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of Bell's new <a href="Volta%20Bureau">Volta Bureau</a>, dedicated to "the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf".

Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort, they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of <a href="sign%20language">sign language</a>, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded. Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing <a href="Deaf%20culture">Deaf culture</a>.

In the following year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the <a href="Boston%20University">Boston University</a> School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was "swept up" by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping "night owl" hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover. Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches. Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.

Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell retained only two students, six-year-old "Georgie" Sanders, deaf from birth, and 15-year-old <a href="Mabel%20Gardiner%20Hubbard">Mabel Hubbard</a>. Each pupil would play an important role in the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem</a> with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to "experiment". Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in. Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years Bell's junior but became the object of his affection. Having lost her hearing after a near-fatal bout of <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a> close to her fifth birthday, she had learned to <a href="Lip%20reading">read lips</a> but her father, <a href="Gardiner%20Greene%20Hubbard">Gardiner Greene Hubbard</a>, Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.

By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston "laboratory" (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success. While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a "<a href="phonautograph">phonautograph</a>", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves. Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.

In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of <a href="Western%20Union">Western Union</a> President <a href="William%20Orton%20%28businessman%29">William Orton</a>, had become "the nervous system of commerce". Orton had contracted with inventors <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a> and <a href="Elisha%20Gray">Elisha Gray</a> to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines. When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments. Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's <a href="patent%20attorney">patent attorney</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Pollok">Anthony Pollok</a>.

In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist <a href="Joseph%20Henry">Joseph Henry</a>, who was then director of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, and asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that Bell had "the germ of a great invention". When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, "Get it!" That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Watson">Thomas A. Watson</a>, an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams, changed all that.

With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant, and the two of them experimented with <a href="acoustic%20telegraphy">acoustic telegraphy</a>. On June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the "gallows" <a href="sound-powered%20telephone">sound-powered telephone</a>, which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.

In 1875, Bell developed an <a href="Acoustic%20Telegraph">acoustic telegraph</a> and drew up a <a href="patent%20application">patent application</a> for it. Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell requested that an associate in Ontario, <a href="George%20Brown%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">George Brown</a>, attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).

Meanwhile, <a href="Elisha%20Gray">Elisha Gray</a> was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a <a href="Patent%20caveat">caveat</a> with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.

Bell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">U.S. Patent Office</a>. Bell's patent covered "the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound" Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.

On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the <a href="electrical%20resistance">electrical resistance</a> in the circuit. When Bell spoke the famous sentence "Mr. Watson—Come here—I want to see you" into the liquid transmitter, Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.

Although Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray, Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent had been granted, and only as a <a href="proof%20of%20concept">proof of concept</a> scientific experiment, to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted. After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.

The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.

The <a href="Patent%20clerk">patent examiner</a>, Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in an <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a> that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer, <a href="Marcellus%20Bailey">Marcellus Bailey</a>, with whom he had served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100. Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money.

Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in <a href="County%20of%20Brant">Mount Pleasant</a> five miles (eight km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.

Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25 million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent. Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.

Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the <a href="scientific%20community">scientific community</a> as well as the general public. A short time later, <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Company%23Early%20promotional%20success">his demonstration of an early telephone prototype</a> at the 1876 <a href="Centennial%20Exposition">Centennial Exposition</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> brought the telephone to international attention. Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II of Brazil</a>. Later, Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to <a href="William%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kelvin">Sir William Thomson</a> (later, Lord Kelvin), a renowned Scottish scientist, as well as to <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, who had requested a private audience at <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a>, her <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> home. She called the demonstration "most extraordinary". The enthusiasm surrounding Bell's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.

The <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Company">Bell Telephone Company</a> was created in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the <a href="carbon%20microphone">carbon microphone</a> from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.

In January 1915, Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental <a href="telephone%20call">telephone call</a>. Calling from the <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Corporation">AT&T</a> head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City, Bell was heard by <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Watson">Thomas Watson</a> at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco. The "New York Times" reported:

As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone. Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage. Bell's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments. The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and <a href="Amos%20Dolbear">Amos Dolbear</a>. In personal correspondence to Bell, both Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.

On January 13, 1887, the U.S. Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation. After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided. By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents (No. 174,465 dated March 7, 1876, and No. 186,787 dated January 30, 1877) were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case's importance as a <a href="stare%20decisis">precedent</a>. With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">US Attorney General</a> dropped the lawsuit on November 30, 1897, leaving several issues undecided <a href="Merit%20%28legal%29">on the merits</a>.

During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Italian inventor <a href="Antonio%20Meucci">Antonio Meucci</a> also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of <a href="ADT%20Security%20Services">American District Telegraph</a> (ADT) of New York, which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in 1901. Meucci's work, like many other inventors of the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving Meucci was eventually dropped upon Meucci's death. However, due to the efforts of Congressman <a href="Vito%20Fossella">Vito Fossella</a>, the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> on June 11, 2002, stated that Meucci's "work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged", even though this did not put an end to a still contentious issue. Some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that Bell's work on the telephone was influenced by Meucci's inventions.

The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world, and patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of <a href="Siemens%20AG">Siemens & Halske (S&H)</a> set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent. The Siemens company produced near-identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties. The establishment of the <a href="International%20Bell%20Telephone%20Company">International Bell Telephone Company</a> in Brussels, Belgium in 1880, as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation. The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court, necessitated by the legal battles, eventually resulted in his resignation from the company.

On July 11, 1877, a few days after the <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Company">Bell Telephone Company</a> was established, Bell married <a href="Mabel%20Gardiner%20Hubbard">Mabel Hubbard</a> (1857–1923) at the Hubbard estate in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>. His wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1,487 of his 1,497 shares in the newly formed Bell Telephone Company. Shortly thereafter, the newlyweds embarked on a year-long honeymoon in Europe. During that excursion, Bell took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a "working holiday". The courtship had begun years earlier; however, Bell waited until he was more financially secure before marrying. Although the telephone appeared to be an "instant" success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897. One unusual request exacted by his fiancée was that he use "Alec" rather than the family's earlier familiar name of "Aleck". From 1876, he would sign his name "Alec Bell". They had four children:
The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when Bell's father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C.; in 1882 he bought a home in the same city for Bell's family, so they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.

Bell was a <a href="British%20subject">British subject</a> throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882 when he became a <a href="naturalized%20citizen">naturalized citizen</a> of the United States. In 1915, he characterized his status as: "I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries." Despite this declaration, Bell has been proudly claimed as a "native son" by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Bells had a vacation on <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton Island</a> in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of <a href="Baddeck%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Baddeck</a>. Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking <a href="Bras%20d%27Or%20Lake">Bras d'Or Lake</a>. By 1889, a large house, christened "The Lodge" was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Bells would name <a href="Beinn%20Bhreagh">Beinn Bhreagh</a> (Gaelic: "beautiful mountain") after Bell's ancestral <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish highlands</a>. Bell also built the <a href="Bell%20Boatyard">Bell Boatyard</a> on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Royal Canadian Navy</a> and pleasure craft for the Bell family. He was an enthusiastic boater, and Bell and his family sailed or rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the <a href="H.W.%20Embree%20and%20Sons">H.W. Embree and Sons</a> boatyard in <a href="Port%20Hawkesbury%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia</a>. In his final, and some of his most productive years, Bell split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn Bhreagh where they spent increasing amounts of time.

Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes, but "Beinn Bhreagh" would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened. Both Mabel and Bell became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as "their own". The Bells were still in residence at "Beinn Bhreagh" when the <a href="Halifax%20Explosion">Halifax Explosion</a> occurred on December 6, 1917. Mabel and Bell mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax.

Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied. According to one of his biographers, <a href="Charlotte%20Gray%20%28author%29">Charlotte Gray</a>, Bell's work ranged "unfettered across the scientific landscape" and he often went to bed voraciously reading the "Encyclopædia Britannica", scouring it for new areas of interest. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the <a href="photophone">photophone</a>, one for the <a href="phonograph">phonograph</a>, five for aerial vehicles, four for "hydroairplanes", and two for <a href="selenium">selenium</a> cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the <a href="audiometer">audiometer</a> to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding <a href="alternative%20fuel">alternative fuel</a>s.

Bell worked extensively in <a href="medical%20research">medical research</a> and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. During his <a href="Volta%20Laboratory%20and%20Bureau">Volta Laboratory</a> period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the <a href="tape%20recorder">tape recorder</a>, the <a href="hard%20disc">hard disc</a> and <a href="floppy%20disc">floppy disc</a> drive, and other <a href="magnetic%20medium">magnetic media</a>.

Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. <a href="Methane">Methane</a> gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with <a href="composting%20toilet">composting toilet</a>s and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using <a href="Photovoltaic%20module">solar panels</a> to heat houses.

Bell and his assistant <a href="Charles%20Sumner%20Tainter">Charles Sumner Tainter</a> jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a <a href="photophone">photophone</a>, which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of <a href="light">light</a>. Both men later became full associates in the <a href="Volta%20Laboratory%20and%20Bureau%23Laboratory%20projects">Volta Laboratory Association</a>.

On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the <a href="Franklin%20School%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Franklin School</a> in Washington, D.C., to Bell at the window of his laboratory, some away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.

Bell believed the photophone's principles were his life's "greatest achievement", telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was "the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone". The photophone was a precursor to the <a href="fiber-optic%20communication">fiber-optic communication</a> systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s. Its master patent was issued in December 1880, many decades before the photophone's principles came into popular use.

Bell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a <a href="metal%20detector">metal detector</a> in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President <a href="James%20Garfield">James Garfield</a>. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.

Bell's own detailed account, presented to the <a href="American%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet. Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield, Bell "proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning ... to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed. It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires. Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes. The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect." In a footnote, Bell adds, "The death of President Garfield and the subsequent "post-mortem" examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus."

The March 1906 "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>" article by American pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of <a href="hydrofoil">hydrofoil</a>s and <a href="Hydroplane%20%28boat%29">hydroplanes</a>. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article, he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant <a href="Frederick%20W.%20Baldwin">Frederick W. "Casey" Baldwin</a> began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor <a href="Enrico%20Forlanini">Enrico Forlanini</a> and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.

During his world tour of 1910–11, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over <a href="Lake%20Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a>. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the "Dhonnas Beag" (Scottish Gaelic for "little devil"), the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil. The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial <a href="HD-4">HD-4</a>, powered by <a href="Renault">Renault</a> engines. A top speed of was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability, and steering, along with the ability to take waves without difficulty. In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in <a href="Westmount%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Westmount, Nova Scotia</a> to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near <a href="Baddeck%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Baddeck, Nova Scotia</a>. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> permitted him to obtain two engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of , a record which stood for ten years.

In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft. The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek "young" help as Bell was at the age of 60.

In 1898, Bell experimented with <a href="tetrahedral">tetrahedral</a> <a href="box%20kite">box kite</a>s and wings constructed of multiple compound <a href="tetrahedral%20kite">tetrahedral kite</a>s covered in maroon silk. The tetrahedral wings were named "Cygnet" I, II, and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned ("Cygnet I" crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907–1912. Some of Bell's kites are on display at the <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell%20honors%20and%20tributes">Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site</a>.

Bell was a supporter of <a href="aerospace%20engineering">aerospace engineering</a> research through the <a href="Aerial%20Experiment%20Association">Aerial Experiment Association</a> (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife <a href="Mabel%20Gardiner%20Hubbard">Mabel</a> and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate. The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men: American <a href="Glenn%20H.%20Curtiss">Glenn H. Curtiss</a>, a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title "world's fastest man", having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the <a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American Trophy</a> for the first official one-kilometre flight in the <a href="Western%20hemisphere">Western hemisphere</a>, and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant <a href="Thomas%20Selfridge">Thomas Selfridge</a>, an official observer from the U.S. Federal government and one of the few people in the army who believed that aviation was the future; <a href="Frederick%20W.%20Baldwin">Frederick W. Baldwin</a>, the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in <a href="Hammondsport%2C%20New%20York">Hammondsport</a>, New York, and <a href="J.%20A%20.D.%20McCurdy">J. A .D. McCurdy</a>–Baldwin and McCurdy being new engineering graduates from the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a>.

The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the "<a href="AEA%20Red%20Wing">Red Wing</a>", framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small <a href="Engine%20cooling">air-cooled</a> engine. On March 12, 1908, over <a href="Keuka%20Lake">Keuka Lake</a>, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America. The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and <a href="Rudder">tail rudder</a> (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control). One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the <a href="aileron">aileron</a>, was to become a standard component on all aircraft. The "White Wing" and "June Bug" were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a <a href="Mabel%20Gardiner%20Hubbard%23Support%20to%20aeronautical%20research">$15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell</a> allowed it to continue with experiments. Lt. Selfridge had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the <a href="Wright%20Model%20A">Wright Flyer</a> at <a href="Fort%20Myer">Fort Myer</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, on September 17, 1908.

Their final aircraft design, the "<a href="AEA%20Silver%20Dart">Silver Dart</a>", embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines. On February 23, 1909, Bell was present as the "Silver Dart" flown by J. A. D. McCurdy from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or made the first aircraft flight in Canada. Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand. With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the "Silver Dart" would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the <a href="Canadian%20Army">Canadian Army</a>.

Bell was connected with the <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> movement in the United States. In his lecture "Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race" presented to the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> on November 13, 1883, he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry. However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist <a href="David%20Starr%20Jordan">David Starr Jordan</a>'s Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the <a href="American%20Breeders%27%20Association">American Breeders' Association</a>. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to humans. From 1912 until 1918, he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the <a href="Eugenics%20Record%20Office">Eugenics Record Office</a> associated with <a href="Cold%20Spring%20Harbor%20Laboratory">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a> in New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the <a href="Second%20International%20Congress%20of%20Eugenics">Second International Congress of Eugenics</a> held under the auspices of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> in New York. Organizations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the <a href="compulsory%20sterilization">compulsory sterilization</a> of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a "defective variety of the human race". By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.

Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his most famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew. Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities to the point that the requests almost became burdensome. During his life, he also received dozens of major awards, medals, and other tributes. These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created, notably the <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Memorial">Bell Telephone Memorial</a> erected in his honor in "Alexander Graham Bell Gardens" in <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a>, Ontario, in 1917.

A large number of Bell's writings, personal correspondence, notebooks, papers, and other documents reside in both the United States <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress Manuscript Division</a> (as the "Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers"), and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute, <a href="Cape%20Breton%20University">Cape Breton University</a>, Nova Scotia; major portions of which are available for online viewing.

A number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North America and Europe, including the first telephone companies in the United States and Canada. Among the major sites are:

In 1880, Bell received the <a href="Volta%20Prize">Volta Prize</a> with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US$ in today's dollars) for the invention of the telephone from the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20fran%C3%A7aise">Académie française</a>, representing the French government. Among the luminaries who judged were <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> and <a href="Alexandre%20Dumas%2C%20fils">Alexandre Dumas</a>. The Volta Prize was conceived by <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in 1801, and named in honor of <a href="Alessandro%20Volta">Alessandro Volta</a>, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious" 'Volta Laboratory Association' "(1880), also known as the" <a href="Volta%20Laboratory%20and%20Bureau">Volta Laboratory</a> "and as the" 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', "and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">Georgetown, Washington, D.C.</a> The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his "proudest achievement", "the <a href="photophone">photophone</a>", the "optical telephone" which presaged <a href="Fiber-optic%20communication">fibre optical telecommunications</a> while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell%20Association%20for%20the%20Deaf%20and%20Hard%20of%20Hearing">Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing</a> (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and <a href="pedagogy">pedagogy</a> of deafness.

In partnership with <a href="Gardiner%20Greene%20Hubbard">Gardiner Greene Hubbard</a>, Bell helped establish the publication "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>" during the early 1880s. In 1898, Bell was elected as the second president of the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a>, serving until 1903, and was primarily responsible for the extensive use of illustrations, including photography, in the magazine. he also became a Regent of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> (1898–1922). The French government conferred on him the decoration of the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a> (Legion of Honor); the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> in London awarded him the <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28RSA%29">Albert Medal</a> in 1902; the <a href="University%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">University of Würzburg</a>, Bavaria, granted him a PhD, and he was awarded the <a href="Franklin%20Institute">Franklin Institute</a>'s <a href="Elliott%20Cresson%20Medal">Elliott Cresson Medal</a> in 1912. He was one of the founders of the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Electrical%20Engineers">American Institute of Electrical Engineers</a> in 1884 and served as its president from 1891–92. Bell was later awarded the AIEE's <a href="Edison%20Medal">Edison Medal</a> in 1914 "For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone".

The "bel" (B) and the smaller "decibel" (dB) are <a href="units%20of%20measurement">units of measurement</a> of <a href="sound%20intensity">sound intensity</a> invented by <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> and named after him. Since 1976, the <a href="IEEE">IEEE</a>'s <a href="IEEE%20Alexander%20Graham%20Bell%20Medal">Alexander Graham Bell Medal</a> has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications.
In 1936, the <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">US Patent Office</a> declared Bell first on its list of the country's greatest inventors, leading to the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">US Post Office</a> issuing a commemorative stamp honoring Bell in 1940 as part of its <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Famous%20Americans%20Series%20of%201940">'Famous Americans Series'</a>. The First Day of Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston, Massachusetts, the city where Bell spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf. The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time. The stamp became and remains to this day, the most valuable one of the series.

The 150th anniversary of Bell's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative £1 banknotes from the <a href="Royal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland%23Commemorative%20banknotes">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>. The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell's face in profile, his signature, and objects from Bell's life and career: users of the telephone over the ages; an audio <a href="waveform">wave signal</a>; a diagram of a telephone receiver; geometric shapes from engineering structures; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet; the geese which helped him to understand flight; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics. Additionally, the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mint%20numismatic%20coins%20%2820th%20century%29%23100%20Dollar%20Gold">C$100 gold coin</a>, in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth, and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada. That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr. Bell's tutelage, named the Silver Dart. Bell's image, and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money, coinage, and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years.

Alexander Graham Bell was ranked 57th among the <a href="100%20Greatest%20Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a> (2002) in an official BBC nationwide poll, and among the <a href="The%20Greatest%20Canadian">Top Ten Greatest Canadians</a> (2004), and <a href="The%20Greatest%20American">the 100 Greatest Americans</a> (2005). In 2006, Bell was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history after having been listed in the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Scotland">National Library of Scotland</a>'s 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame'. Bell's name is still widely known and used as part of the names of dozens of educational institutes, corporate namesakes, street and place names around the world.

Alexander Graham Bell, who could not complete the university program of his youth, received at least a dozen honorary degrees from academic institutions, including eight honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">LL.D.s</a> (Doctorate of Laws), two Ph.D.s, a D.Sc., and an M.D.:



Bell died of complications arising from <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a> on August 2, 1922, at his private estate in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, at age 75. Bell had also been afflicted with <a href="pernicious%20anemia">pernicious anemia</a>. His last view of the land he had inhabited was by moonlight on his mountain estate at 2:00 a.m. While tending to him after his long illness, Mabel, his wife, whispered, "Don't leave me." By way of reply, Bell signed "no...", lost consciousness, and died shortly after.

On learning of Bell's death, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Canadian Prime Minister</a>, <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">Mackenzie King</a>, cabled Mrs. Bell, saying:
My colleagues in the Government join with me in expressing to you our sense of the world's loss in the death of your distinguished husband. It will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention, with which his name is immortally associated, is a part of its history. On the behalf of the citizens of Canada, may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy.

Bell's coffin was constructed of Beinn Bhreagh pine by his laboratory staff, lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite experiments. To help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests not to wear black (the traditional funeral color) while attending his service, during which soloist Jean MacDonald sang a verse of <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s "Requiem":

Upon the conclusion of Bell's funeral, "every phone on the continent of North America was silenced in honor of the man who had given to mankind the means for direct communication at a distance".

Dr. Alexander Graham Bell was buried atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain, on his estate where he had resided increasingly for the last 35 years of his life, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake. He was survived by his wife <a href="Mabel%20Gardiner%20Hubbard">Mabel</a>, his two daughters, Elsie May and Marian, and nine of his grandchildren.

Anatolia

Anatolia ( , in <a href="Modern%20Greek">Modern Greek</a>: , from , ', ' – "east" or "(sun)rise";), in geography known as Asia Minor (, in <a href="Medieval%20Greek">Medieval</a> and <a href="Modern%20Greek">Modern Greek</a>: , ', ' – "small Asia"), Asian Turkey, the Anatolian peninsula, or the Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, which makes up the majority of modern-day <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. The region is bounded by the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> to the north, the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> to the south, and the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> to the west. The <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a> forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> and <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> straits and separates Anatolia from <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> on the <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an mainland.

Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to a line between the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Alexandretta">Gulf of Alexandretta</a> and the Black Sea to the <a href="Armenian%20Highlands">Armenian Highlands</a> (Armenia Major). This region is now named and largely situated in the <a href="Eastern%20Anatolia%20Region">Eastern Anatolia Region</a> of the far north east of <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and converges with the <a href="Lesser%20Caucasus">Lesser Caucasus</a> – an area that was incorporated in the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> region of <a href="Transcaucasia">Transcaucasia</a> in the 19th century. Thus, traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey.

Anatolia is often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey, which comprises almost the entire country; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be the <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> borders with neighboring <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, and <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, in clockwise direction.

The <a href="Ancient%20Anatolians">ancient inhabitants of Anatolia</a> spoke the now-extinct <a href="Anatolian%20languages">Anatolian languages</a>, which were largely replaced by the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek language</a> starting from <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a> and during the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a>, <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> periods. The <a href="Turkification">Turkification</a> of Anatolia began under the <a href="Seljuk%20Empire">Seljuk Empire</a> in the late 11th century and continued under the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> between the early 14th and early 20th centuries. However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including <a href="Kurdish%20language">Kurdish</a>, <a href="Assyrian%20Neo-Aramaic">Assyrian</a>, <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a>, <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, <a href="Laz%20language">Laz</a>, <a href="Georgian%20language">Georgian</a>, and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>. Ancient peoples in the region included <a href="Galatians%20%28people%29">Galatians</a>, <a href="Hurrians">Hurrians</a>, <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>, <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrians</a>, <a href="Medes">Medes</a>, <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a>, <a href="Hattians">Hattians</a>, <a href="Cimmerian">Cimmerian</a>s, <a href="Ionian%20Greeks">Ionian Greeks</a>, the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a> and <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>.

The Anatolian <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>, also called Asia Minor, is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> to the south, the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> to the west, and the Sea of Marmara to the northwest, which separates Anatolia from Thrace in Europe.

Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Alexandretta">Gulf of Alexandretta</a> to the Black Sea, coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. This traditional geographical definition is used, for example, in the latest edition of "<a href="Merriam-Webster%27s%20Geographical%20Dictionary">Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary</a>", as well as the archeological community. Under this definition, Anatolia is bounded to the east by the <a href="Armenian%20Highlands">Armenian Highlands</a>, and the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> before that river bends to the southeast to enter <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. To the southeast, it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in <a href="Syria%20%28region%29">Syria (region)</a> and the Mesopotamian plain.

Following the <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> and <a href="History%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Turkey">establishment of the Republic of Turkey</a>, the Armenian Highlands (or <a href="Western%20Armenia">Western Armenia</a>) <a href="Eastern%20Anatolia%20Region%23Substitution%20with%20Armenia">were renamed "Eastern Anatolia"</a> (literally "The Eastern East") by the Turkish government, being effectively co-terminous with Asian Turkey. Turkey's <a href="First%20Geography%20Congress%2C%20Turkey">First Geography Congress</a> in 1941 created two <a href="geographical%20regions%20of%20Turkey">regions</a> to the east of the Gulf of Iskenderun-Black Sea line named the <a href="Eastern%20Anatolia%20Region">Eastern Anatolia Region</a> and the <a href="Southeastern%20Anatolia%20Region">Southeastern Anatolia Region</a>, the former largely corresponding to the western part of the Armenian Highland, the latter to the northern part of the Mesopotamian plain. This wider definition of Anatolia has gained widespread currency outside of Turkey and has, for instance, been adopted by "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>" and other encyclopedic and general reference publications. Vazken Davidian terms the expanded use of "Anatolia" to apply to territory formerly referred to as Armenia as "an historical imposition", and notes that a growing body of literature is uncomfortable with referring to the Ottoman East as "Eastern Anatolia".

The oldest known reference to Anatolia – as “Land of the <a href="Hittites">Hatti</a>” – appears on <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a> tablets from the period of the <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadian Empire</a> (2350–2150 BC). The first recorded name the Greeks used for the Anatolian peninsula, Ἀσία (<a href="%3Awikt%3AAsia">Asía</a>), presumably echoed the name of the <a href="Assuwa%20league">Assuwa league</a> in western Anatolia. As the name "Asia" broadened its scope to apply to other areas east of the Mediterranean, Greeks in <a href="Late%20Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a> came to use the name Μικρὰ Ἀσία ("Mikrá Asía") or Asia Minor, meaning "Lesser Asia" to refer to present-day Anatolia.

The English-language name "Anatolia" itself derives from the Greek ("") meaning “the East” or more literally “sunrise” (comparable to the Latin-derived terms “<a href="levant">levant</a>” and “<a href="orient">orient</a>”). The precise reference of this term has varied over time, perhaps originally referring to the <a href="Aeolians">Aeolian</a>, <a href="Ionians">Ionian</a> and <a href="Dorians">Dorian</a> colonies on the west coast of Asia Minor. In the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the <a href="Anatolic%20Theme">Anatolic Theme</a> (Aνατολικόν θέμα) was a "<a href="Theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29">theme</a>" covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day <a href="Central%20Anatolia%20Region">Central Anatolia Region</a>.
The modern Turkish form of Anatolia, "Anadolu", derives from the Greek name Aνατολή ("Anatolḗ"). The Russian male name <a href="Anatoly">Anatoly</a> and the French <a href="Anatole%20%28disambiguation%29">Anatole</a> share the same linguistic origin.

In English the name of "<a href="Name%20of%20Turkey">Turkey</a>" for ancient Anatolia first appeared c. 1369. It derives from the <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> "Turchia" (meaning “Land of the Turks”, Turkish "Türkiye"), a name originally used by Europeans to designate those parts of Anatolia controlled by the <a href="Seljuk%20Empire">Seljuk</a> <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Rum">Sultanate of Rum</a> after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a> (1071).

Human habitation in Anatolia dates back to the <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a>. <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> Anatolia has been <a href="Anatolian%20hypothesis">proposed</a> as the <a href="Urheimat">homeland</a> of the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European language family</a>, although linguists tend to favour a <a href="Kurgan%20hypothesis">later origin</a> in the steppes north of the Black Sea. However, it is clear that the <a href="Anatolian%20languages">Anatolian languages</a>, the oldest attested branch of Indo-European, have been spoken in Anatolia since at least the 19th century BC.

The earliest historical records of Anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n-based <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadian Empire</a> during the reign of <a href="Sargon%20of%20Akkad">Sargon of Akkad</a> in the 24th century BC. Scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of Anatolia were the <a href="Hattians">Hattians</a> and <a href="Hurrians">Hurrians</a>. The Hattians spoke a <a href="Hattic%20language">language</a> of unclear affiliation, and the <a href="Hurrian%20language">Hurrian language</a> belongs to a small family called <a href="Hurro-Urartian%20languages">Hurro-Urartian</a>, all these languages now being extinct; relationships with indigenous <a href="languages%20of%20the%20Caucasus">languages of the Caucasus</a> have been proposed but are not generally accepted. The region was famous for exporting raw materials, and areas of <a href="Hittite%20empire">Hattian</a>- and Hurrian-populated southeast Anatolia were colonised by the Akkadians.

After the fall of the <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadian Empire</a> in the mid-21st century BC, the Assyrians, who were the northern branch of the Akkadian people, colonised parts of the region between the 21st and mid-18th centuries BC and claimed its resources, notably <a href="silver">silver</a>. One of the numerous cuneiform records dated circa 20th century BC, found in Anatolia at the Assyrian colony of <a href="K%C3%BCltepe">Kanesh</a>, uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.

Unlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> were centred at <a href="Hattusa">Hattusa</a> (modern Boğazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite language</a>, or "nesili" (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of <a href="K%C3%BCltepe">Nesa</a> around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted <a href="Kurgan%20theory">Kurgan theory</a> on the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20homeland">Proto-Indo-European homeland</a>, however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European <a href="ancient%20Anatolians">ancient Anatolians</a>) were themselves relatively recent <a href="Indo-European%20migrations">immigrants</a> to Anatolia from the north.

The Hittites adopted the cuneiform script, invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 1650 BC, they created a kingdom, the <a href="Hittites%23New%20Kingdom">Hittite New Kingdom</a>, which became an empire in the 14th century BC after the conquest of <a href="Kizzuwatna">Kizzuwatna</a> in the south-east and the defeat of the <a href="Assuwa%20league">Assuwa league</a> in western Anatolia. The empire reached its height in the 13th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as a non-Indo-European people, the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal <a href="Kaskians">Kaskians</a>, had established themselves there, displacing earlier <a href="Palaic%20language">Palaic-speaking</a> Indo-Europeans. Much of the history of the Hittite Empire concerned war with the rival empires of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> and the <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a>.

The <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the Hittites and becoming wary of the power of Assyria, which had destroyed the Mitanni Empire. The Assyrians and Hittites were then left to battle over control of eastern and southern Anatolia and colonial territories in <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. The Assyrians had better success than the Egyptians, annexing much Hittite (and Hurrian) territory in these regions.

After 1180 BC, during the <a href="Late%20Bronze%20Age%20collapse">Late Bronze Age collapse</a>, the Hittite empire disintegrated into several independent <a href="Syro-Hittite%20states">Syro-Hittite states</a>, subsequent to losing much territory to the <a href="Middle%20Assyrian%20Empire">Middle Assyrian Empire</a> and being finally overrun by the <a href="Phrygians">Phrygians</a>, another Indo-European people who are believed to have migrated from the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. The Phrygian expansion into southeast Anatolia was eventually halted by the Assyrians, who controlled that region.

<a href="Arameans">Arameans</a> encroached over the borders of south central Anatolia in the century or so after the fall of the Hittite empire, and some of the Syro-Hittite states in this region became an amalgam of Hittites and Arameans. These became known as <a href="Syro-Hittite%20states">Syro-Hittite states</a>.

In central and western Anatolia, another Indo-European people, the <a href="Luwian%20language">Luwians</a>, came to the fore, circa 2000 BC. Their language was closely related to <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite</a>. The general consensus amongst scholars is that Luwian was spoken—to a greater or lesser degree—across a large area of western Anatolia, including (possibly) <a href="Wilusa">Wilusa</a> (<a href="Troy">Troy</a>), the Seha River Land (to be identified with the <a href="Gediz%20River">Hermos</a> and/or <a href="Bak%C4%B1r%C3%A7ay">Kaikos</a> valley), and the kingdom of Mira-Kuwaliya with its core territory of the Maeander valley. From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, <a href="Caria">Caria</a> and <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a>, all of which had <a href="Greece">Hellenic</a> influence.

From the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the east, central, and southeastern regions) fell to the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Neo-Assyrian Empire</a>, including all of the <a href="Syro-Hittite%20states">Syro-Hittite states</a>, <a href="Tabal">Tabal</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Commagene">Kingdom of Commagene</a>, the <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> and <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> and swathes of <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>.

The Neo-Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by <a href="Medes">Medes</a>, <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a>, Scythians and their own <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>n relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was <a href="Harran">Harran</a> in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, the Assyrian <a href="Nabonidus">Nabonidus</a> and his son and regent <a href="Belshazzar">Belshazzar</a>. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based <a href="Medes">Median Empire</a>, with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.

From the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> and <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>. The Cimmerians overran <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a> and the Scythians threatened to do the same to Urartu and <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, before both were finally checked by the Assyrians.

The north-western coast of Anatolia was inhabited by Greeks of the <a href="Achaeans%20%28tribe%29">Achaean</a>/<a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> culture from the 20th century BC, related to the Greeks of south eastern Europe and the <a href="Aegean%20Islands">Aegean</a>. Beginning with the <a href="Bronze%20Age%20collapse">Bronze Age collapse</a> at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the west coast of Anatolia was settled by <a href="Ionian%20Greeks">Ionian Greeks</a>, usurping the area of the related but earlier <a href="Mycenaean%20Greeks">Mycenaean Greeks</a>. Over several centuries, numerous Ancient Greek <a href="city-state">city-state</a>s were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia (<a href="Pre-Socratic%20philosophy">Pre-Socratic philosophy</a>).

In classical antiquity, Anatolia was described by <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and later historians as divided into regions named after tribes such as <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a>, <a href="Caria">Caria</a>, <a href="Mysia">Mysia</a>, <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a>, <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>, <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a>, <a href="Lycaonia">Lycaonia</a>, <a href="Pisidia">Pisidia</a>, <a href="Paphlagonia">Paphlagonia</a>, <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, and <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>. By that time, the populations were a mixture of the ancient Anatolian or "<a href="Syro-Hittite">Syro-Hittite</a>" substrate and post-Bronze-Age-collapse "Thraco-Phrygian" and more recent Greco-Macedonian incursions.

Anatolia is known as the birthplace of minted <a href="coin">coin</a>age (as opposed to unminted coinage, which first appears in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> at a much earlier date) as a medium of exchange, some time in the 7th century BC in Lydia. The use of minted coins continued to flourish during the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> eras.

During the 6th century BC, all of Anatolia was conquered by the <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, the Persians having usurped the <a href="Medes">Medes</a> as the dominant dynasty in <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. In 499 BC, the Ionian city-states on the west coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule. The <a href="Ionian%20Revolt">Ionian Revolt</a>, as it became known, though quelled, initiated the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a>, which ended in a Greek victory in 449 BC, and the Ionian cities regained their independence, alongside the withdrawal of the Persian forces from their European territories.

In 334 BC, the <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonian</a> Greek king <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> conquered the peninsula from the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Alexander's conquest opened up the interior of Asia Minor to Greek settlement and influence.
Following the death of Alexander and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the <a href="Attalid%20dynasty">Attalids of Pergamum</a> and the <a href="Seleucids">Seleucids</a>, the latter controlling most of Anatolia. A period of peaceful <a href="Hellenization">Hellenization</a> followed, such that the local Anatolian languages had been supplanted by Greek by the 1st century BC. In 133 BC the last Attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, and western and central Anatolia came under <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> control, but <a href="Hellenistic%20culture">Hellenistic culture</a> remained predominant. Further annexations by Rome, in particular of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Pontus">Kingdom of Pontus</a> by <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a>, brought all of Anatolia under Roman control, except for the eastern frontier with the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>, which remained unstable for centuries, causing a series of wars, culminating in the <a href="Roman-Parthian%20Wars">Roman-Parthian Wars</a>.

After the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Anatolia was one of the first places where Christianity spread, so that by the 4th century AD, western and central Anatolia were overwhelmingly Christian and Greek-speaking. For the next 600 years, while Imperial possessions in Europe were subjected to barbarian invasions, Anatolia would be the center of the Hellenic world. Byzantine control was challenged by <a href="Arabs">Arab</a> raids starting in the eighth century (see <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20wars">Arab–Byzantine wars</a>), but in the ninth and tenth century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories, including even long lost territory such as <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> and <a href="Syria">Syria</a> (ancient <a href="Aram%20%28biblical%20region%29">Aram</a>).

In the 10 years following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a> in 1071, the <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a> from <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> migrated over large areas of Anatolia, with particular concentrations around the northwestern rim. The Turkish language and the Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking (although ethnic groups such as Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians remained numerous and retained Christianity and their native languages). In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern Anatolia. Control of Anatolia was then split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk <a href="Sultanate%20of%20R%C3%BBm">Sultanate of Rûm</a>, with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced.

In 1255, the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a> swept through eastern and central Anatolia, and would remain until 1335. The <a href="Ilkhanate">Ilkhanate</a> garrison was stationed near <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>. After the decline of the Ilkhanate from 1335–1353, the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol Empire</a>'s legacy in the region was the <a href="Uyghur%20people">Uyghur</a> <a href="Eretna%20Dynasty">Eretna Dynasty</a> that was overthrown by <a href="Kadi%20Burhan%20al-Din">Kadi Burhan al-Din</a> in 1381.

By the end of the 14th century, most of Anatolia was controlled by various <a href="Anatolian%20beyliks">Anatolian beyliks</a>. Smyrna fell in 1330, and the last Byzantine stronghold in Anatolia, Philadelphia, fell in 1390. The <a href="Turkmen%20people">Turkmen</a> Beyliks were under the control of the Mongols, at least nominally, through declining Seljuk sultans. The Beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the <a href="Mongol">Mongol</a> <a href="Ilkhanids">Ilkhanids</a>. The <a href="Osmanli">Osmanli</a> ruler <a href="Osman%20I">Osman I</a> was the first Turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320s, for it bears the legend "Minted by Osman son of Ertugul". Since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in Islamic practice only to a <a href="sovereign">sovereign</a>, it can be considered that the Osmanli, or Ottoman Turks, became formally independent from the Mongol Khans.

Among the <a href="Turkish%20people">Turkish</a> leaders, the <a href="Ottoman%20dynasty">Ottomans</a> emerged as great power under <a href="Osman%20I">Osman I</a> and his son <a href="Orhan%20I">Orhan I</a>. The Anatolian <a href="Anatolian%20beyliks">beyliks</a> were successively absorbed into the rising <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> during the 15th century. It is not well understood how the Osmanlı, or <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Turks</a>, came to dominate their neighbours, as the history of medieval Anatolia is still little known. The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of <a href="Halicarnassus">Halicarnassus</a> (modern <a href="Bodrum">Bodrum</a>) from the <a href="Knights%20of%20Saint%20John">Knights of Saint John</a>.

With the acceleration of the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, and as a result of the expansionist policies of <a href="Czarist%20Russia">Czarist Russia</a> in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, many Muslim nations and groups in that region, mainly <a href="Circassians">Circassians</a>, <a href="Tatars">Tatars</a>, <a href="Azeris">Azeris</a>, <a href="Lezgian%20people">Lezgis</a>, <a href="Chechens">Chechens</a> and several <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> groups left their homelands and settled in Anatolia. As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a> regions and then fragmented during the <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a>, much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a>, <a href="Turkish%20people">Turks</a>, <a href="Pomaks">Muslim Bulgarians</a> and <a href="Greek%20Muslims">Greek Muslims</a> such as the <a href="Vallahades">Vallahades</a> from <a href="Macedonia%20%28Greece%29">Greek Macedonia</a>), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.

A continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe.

Following the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces.

Anatolia remained <a href="multi-ethnic">multi-ethnic</a> until the early 20th century (see the <a href="rise%20of%20nationalism%20under%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire</a>). During World War I, the <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>, the <a href="Greek%20genocide">Greek genocide</a> (especially in <a href="Pontus%20%28region%29">Pontus</a>), and the <a href="Assyrian%20genocide">Assyrian genocide</a> almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of <a href="Armenians">Armenian</a>, <a href="Greeks">Greek</a>, and <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> populations in Anatolia and surrounding regions. Following the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20of%201919%E2%80%931922">Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922</a>, most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 <a href="population%20exchange%20between%20Greece%20and%20Turkey">population exchange between Greece and Turkey</a>. Many more have left Turkey since, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today. Since the foundation of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Turkey">Republic of Turkey</a> in 1923, Anatolia has been within Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see <a href="demographics%20of%20Turkey">demographics of Turkey</a> and <a href="history%20of%20Turkey">history of Turkey</a>).

Anatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central <a href="massif">massif</a> composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded <a href="Trough%20%28geology%29">troughs</a>, covered by recent <a href="Deposit%20%28geology%29">deposits</a> and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the <a href="K%C4%B1z%C4%B1l%20River">Kızıl River</a>, the coastal plains of <a href="%C3%87ukurova">Çukurova</a> and the valley floors of the <a href="Gediz%20River">Gediz River</a> and the <a href="B%C3%BCy%C3%BCk%20Menderes%20River">Büyük Menderes River</a> as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around <a href="Lake%20Tuz">Lake Tuz</a> (Salt Lake) and the <a href="Konya">Konya</a> Basin ("Konya Ovasi").

Anatolia has a varied range of climates. The central plateau is characterized by a continental climate, with hot summers and cold snowy winters. The south and west coasts enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters, and warm dry summers. The Black Sea and Marmara coasts have a temperate oceanic climate, with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year.

There is a diverse number of plant and animal communities.

The mountains and coastal plain of northern Anatolia experiences humid and mild climate. There are <a href="temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forest">temperate broadleaf, mixed</a> and <a href="temperate%20coniferous%20forest">coniferous</a> forests. The central and eastern plateau, with its drier <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a>, has deciduous forests and forest steppes. Western and southern Anatolia, which have a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a>, contain <a href="Mediterranean%20forests%2C%20woodlands%2C%20and%20scrub">Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub</a> ecoregions.

Almost 80% of the people currently residing in Anatolia are <a href="Turkish%20people">Turks</a>. <a href="Kurds">Kurds</a> constitute a major community in southeastern Anatolia, and are the largest ethnic minority. <a href="Abkhazians">Abkhazians</a>, <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a>, <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a>, <a href="Armenians">Armenians</a>, <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrians</a>, <a href="Azerbaijani%20people">Azerbaijanis</a>, Bosnian Muslims, <a href="Circassians">Circassians</a>, <a href="Gagauz%20people">Gagauz</a>, <a href="Georgians">Georgians</a>, <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>, <a href="Hemshin%20people">Hemshin</a>, <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, <a href="Laz%20people">Laz</a>, <a href="Levantines">Levantines</a>, <a href="Pomaks">Pomaks</a>, <a href="Zaza%20people">Zazas</a> and a number of other ethnic groups also live in Anatolia in smaller numbers.

<a href="Bamia">Bamia</a> is a traditional Anatolian-era stew dish prepared using <a href="lamb%20and%20mutton">lamb</a>, <a href="okra">okra</a> and tomatoes as primary ingredients.

Apple was founded by <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>, <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, and <a href="Ronald%20Wayne">Ronald Wayne</a> in April 1976 to develop and sell personal computers. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers saw significant momentum and revenue growth for the company. Within a few years, they had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">went public</a> in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a>s, and Apple's marketing commercials for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. Jobs resigned from Apple and created <a href="NeXT">his own company</a>. As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers saw diminishing sales due to lower-priced products from competitors, in particular those offered with the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> operating system. More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until then-CEO <a href="Gil%20Amelio">Gil Amelio</a> in 1997 decided to buy Jobs' company to bring him back. Jobs regained position as CEO, and began a process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own <a href="Apple%20Store">retail stores</a> in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changed some of the hardware technology used in its computers. It again saw success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics and announced the <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a>, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and <a href="Tim%20Cook">Tim Cook</a> became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company.

Apple is the <a href="List%20of%20the%20largest%20information%20technology%20companies">world's largest information technology company</a> by revenue and the <a href="Mobile%20phone%23By%20manufacturer">world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer</a> after <a href="Samsung">Samsung</a>. In February 2015, Apple became the first U.S. company to be valued at over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>700billion. The company employs 116,000 full-time employees and maintains 498 <a href="Apple%20Store">retail stores</a> in 22 countries . It operates the iTunes Store, which is the world's largest music retailer. , more than one billion Apple products are actively in use worldwide.

Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $215billion for the 2016 <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a>. The company enjoys a high level of <a href="brand%20loyalty">brand loyalty</a> and has been repeatedly ranked as the world's most valuable brand. However, it <a href="Criticism%20of%20Apple%20Inc.">receives significant criticism</a> regarding the labor practices of its contractors and its environmental and business practices, including the origins of source materials.

Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>, <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Wayne">Ronald Wayne</a>. The company's first product was the <a href="Apple%20I">Apple I</a>, a computer single-handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak, and first shown to the public at the <a href="Homebrew%20Computer%20Club">Homebrew Computer Club</a>. Apple I was sold as a <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a> (with <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a>, <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a>, and basic textual-video chips), which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer. The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($ in dollars, adjusted for inflation).

Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977, without Wayne, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800. Multimillionaire <a href="Mike%20Markkula">Mike Markkula</a> provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple. During the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980 yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118m, an average annual growth rate of 533%.

The <a href="Apple%20II%20series">Apple II</a>, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first <a href="West%20Coast%20Computer%20Faire">West Coast Computer Faire</a>. It differed from its major rivals, the <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> and <a href="Commodore%20PET">Commodore PET</a>, because of its character cell-based color graphics and <a href="open%20architecture">open architecture</a>. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 ¼ inch <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a> drive and interface called the <a href="Disk%20II">Disk II</a>. The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "<a href="killer%20application">killer app</a>" of the business world: <a href="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a>, a <a href="spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a> <a href="Computer%20program">program</a>. VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office. Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore</a> and <a href="Tandy%20Computers">Tandy</a>.

By the end of 1970's, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the <a href="Apple%20III">Apple III</a> in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with <a href="IBM">IBM</a> and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> in the business and corporate computing market. Jobs and several Apple employees, including <a href="Jef%20Raskin">Jef Raskin</a>, visited <a href="PARC%20%28company%29">Xerox PARC</a> in December 1979 to see the <a href="Xerox%20Alto">Xerox Alto</a>. <a href="Xerox">Xerox</a> granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.

Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface (<a href="Graphical%20user%20interface">GUI</a>), and development of a GUI began for the <a href="Apple%20Lisa">Apple Lisa</a>. In 1982, however, he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a>. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.

On December 12, 1980, Apple went public at $22 per share, generating more capital than any IPO since <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a> in 1956 and immediately creating 300 millionaires.

In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer to be sold without a <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>. Its debut was signified by <a href="1984%20%28advertisement%29">"1984"</a>, a $1.5million television commercial directed by <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a> that aired during the third quarter of <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XVIII">Super Bowl XVIII</a> on January 22, 1984. The commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success and was called a "masterpiece" by <a href="CNN">CNN</a> and one of the greatest commercials of all time by "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>".

The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the <a href="LaserWriter">LaserWriter</a>, the first <a href="PostScript">PostScript</a> <a href="laser%20printer">laser printer</a> to be sold at a reasonable price, and <a href="Adobe%20PageMaker">PageMaker</a>, an early <a href="desktop%20publishing">desktop publishing</a> package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market. The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.

In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO <a href="John%20Sculley">John Sculley</a>, who had been hired two years earlier. The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to "contain" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%23Other%20uses%20of%20the%20term">coup</a> and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties. Jobs resigned from Apple and founded <a href="NeXT">NeXT Inc.</a> the same year.
After Jobs' departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher <a href="profit%20margin">profit margin</a>, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as <a href="power%20user">power user</a>s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to <a href="Jean-Louis%20Gass%C3%A9e">Jean-Louis Gassée</a>'s mantra of "fifty-five or die", referring to the 55% <a href="profit%20margin">profit margin</a>s of the <a href="Macintosh%20II">Macintosh II</a>.

This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on <a href="IBM%20PC%20compatible">PC clones</a> that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price. Gassée's objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990. Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the <a href="Macintosh%20Classic">Macintosh Classic</a>, <a href="Macintosh%20LC">Macintosh LC</a> and <a href="Macintosh%20IIsi">Macintosh IIsi</a>, all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand.

In 1991, Apple introduced the <a href="PowerBook">PowerBook</a>, replacing the "luggable" <a href="Macintosh%20Portable">Macintosh Portable</a> with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced <a href="System%207">System 7</a>, a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Classic Mac OS</a>. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue. For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine "<a href="MacLife">MacAddict</a>" named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.

Apple believed the <a href="Apple%20II%20series">Apple II series</a> was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low-end Macintosh. In the 1990s, Apple released the <a href="Macintosh%20LC">Macintosh LC</a>, and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II. The <a href="Apple%20IIe">Apple IIe</a> was discontinued in 1993.

The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end <a href="Macintosh%20Quadra">Quadra</a>, the mid-range <a href="Macintosh%20Centris">Centris</a> line, and the ill-fated <a href="Macintosh%20Performa">Performa</a> series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.

Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including <a href="Apple%20QuickTake">digital cameras</a>, <a href="PowerCD">portable CD audio players</a>, <a href="AppleDesign%20Powered%20Speakers">speakers</a>, <a href="Apple%20Bandai%20Pippin">video consoles</a>, the <a href="eWorld">eWorld</a> online service, and <a href="Apple%20Interactive%20Television%20Box">TV appliances</a>. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued <a href="Newton%20%28platform%29">Newton division</a> based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts. Ultimately, none of these products helped and Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.

Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience. Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the <a href="Apple%20Lisa">Apple Lisa</a> in "<a href="Apple%20Computer%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Microsoft%20Corp.">Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.</a>" The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed. At this time, a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied Apple's reputation, and Sculley was replaced as CEO by <a href="Michael%20Spindler">Michael Spindler</a>.

By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as <a href="A/UX">A/UX</a>. The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from <a href="OS/2">OS/2</a> and <a href="UNIX">UNIX</a> vendors such as <a href="Sun%20Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.

In 1994, Apple allied with <a href="IBM">IBM</a> and <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> in the <a href="AIM%20alliance">AIM alliance</a> with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the <a href="PowerPC%20Reference%20Platform">PowerPC Reference Platform</a>), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the <a href="Power%20Macintosh">Power Macintosh</a>, the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's <a href="PowerPC">PowerPC</a> processor.

In 1996, Spindler was replaced by <a href="Gil%20Amelio">Gil Amelio</a> as CEO. Amelio made numerous changes at Apple, including extensive layoffs and cut costs. After numerous failed attempts to improve Mac OS, first with the <a href="Taligent">Taligent</a> project and later with <a href="Copland%20%28operating%20system%29">Copland</a> and <a href="Copland%20%28operating%20system%29">Gershwin</a>, Amelio chose to purchase <a href="NeXT">NeXT</a> and its <a href="NeXTSTEP">NeXTSTEP</a> operating system and bring Steve Jobs back to Apple.

The NeXT deal was finalized on February 9, 1997, bringing Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Amelio was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. Jobs acted as the interim CEO and began restructuring the company's product line; it was during this period that he identified the design talent of <a href="Jonathan%20Ive">Jonathan Ive</a>, and the pair worked collaboratively to rebuild Apple's status.

At the 1997 <a href="Macworld/iWorld">Macworld Expo</a>, Jobs announced that Apple would join Microsoft to release new versions of <a href="Microsoft%20Office">Microsoft Office</a> for the Macintosh, and that Microsoft had made a $150million investment in non-voting Apple stock. On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the <a href="Apple%20Store%20%28online%29">Apple Online Store</a>, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.

On August 15, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the <a href="Macintosh%20128K">Macintosh 128K</a>: the <a href="iMac%20G3">iMac</a>. The iMac design team was led by Ive, who would later design the <a href="iPod">iPod</a> and the <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a>. The iMac featured modern technology and a unique design, and sold almost 800,000 units in its first five months.

During this period, Apple completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital production software for both professionals and consumers. In 1998, Apple purchased <a href="Macromedia">Macromedia</a>'s Key Grip software project, signaling an expansion into the <a href="digital%20video">digital video</a> editing market. The sale was an outcome of Macromedia's decision to solely focus upon web development software. The product, still unfinished at the time of the sale, was renamed "<a href="Final%20Cut%20Pro">Final Cut Pro</a>" when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999. The development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product <a href="iMovie">iMovie</a> in October 1999. Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte, which had developed <a href="DVD%20authoring">DVD authoring</a> technology, as well as Astarte's corresponding products and engineering team in April 2000. Astarte's digital tool DVDirector was subsequently transformed into the professional-oriented <a href="DVD%20Studio%20Pro">DVD Studio Pro</a> software product. Apple then employed the same technology to create <a href="iDVD">iDVD</a> for the consumer market. In 2002, Apple purchased <a href="Nothing%20Real">Nothing Real</a> for their advanced digital <a href="compositing">compositing</a> application <a href="Shake%20%28software%29">Shake</a>, as well as <a href="Emagic">Emagic</a> for the music productivity application <a href="Logic%20Pro">Logic</a>. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level <a href="GarageBand">GarageBand</a> application. The release of <a href="iPhoto">iPhoto</a> in the same year completed the <a href="iLife">iLife</a> suite.

<a href="macOS">Mac OS X</a>, based on NeXT's <a href="OpenStep">OPENSTEP</a> and <a href="Berkeley%20Software%20Distribution">BSD Unix</a>, was released on March 24, 2001, after several years of development. Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X aimed to combine the stability, reliability and security of <a href="Unix">Unix</a> with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface. To aid users in migrating from <a href="Mac%20OS%209">Mac OS 9</a>, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the <a href="Classic%20Environment">Classic Environment</a>.

On May 19, 2001, Apple opened its first official eponymous <a href="Apple%20Store%20%28retail%29">retail stores</a> in Virginia and California. On October 23 of the same year, Apple debuted the <a href="iPod">iPod</a> portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100million units sold within six years. In 2003, Apple's <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> was introduced. The service offered online <a href="music%20download">music download</a>s for $0.99 a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes Store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008. Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.

At the <a href="Worldwide%20Developers%20Conference">Worldwide Developers Conference</a> keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would begin producing <a href="Intel">Intel</a>-based Mac computers in 2006. On January 10, 2006, the new <a href="MacBook%20Pro">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="iMac">iMac</a> became the first Apple computers to use Intel's <a href="Core%20Duo">Core Duo</a> CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced. The Power Mac, iBook and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the <a href="Mac%20Pro">Mac Pro</a>, <a href="MacBook">MacBook</a>, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors. On April 29, 2009, "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips. Apple also introduced <a href="Boot%20Camp%20%28software%29">Boot Camp</a> in 2006 to help users install <a href="Windows%20XP">Windows XP</a> or <a href="Windows%20Vista">Windows Vista</a> on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.

Apple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80. In January 2006, Apple's <a href="market%20cap">market cap</a> surpassed that of <a href="Dell">Dell</a>. Nine years prior, Dell's CEO <a href="Michael%20Dell">Michael Dell</a> had said that if he ran Apple he would "shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders." Although Apple's market share in computers had grown, it remained far behind competitors using Microsoft Windows, accounting for about 8% of desktops and laptops in the US.

Since 2001, Apple's design team has progressively abandoned the use of translucent colored plastics first used in the <a href="iMac%20G3">iMac G3</a>. This design change began with the <a href="titanium">titanium</a>-made <a href="PowerBook">PowerBook</a> and was followed by the <a href="iBook">iBook</a>'s white <a href="polycarbonate">polycarbonate</a> structure and the flat-panel <a href="iMac">iMac</a>.

During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as "Apple Inc.", because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics. This event also saw the announcement of the <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and the <a href="Apple%20TV">Apple TV</a>. The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales, and the device was called "a game changer for the industry". Apple would achieve widespread success with its iPhone, <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a> and <a href="iPad">iPad</a> products, which introduced innovations in <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a>s, <a href="portable%20music%20player">portable music player</a>s and <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s respectively. Furthermore, by early 2007, 800,000 Final Cut Pro users were registered.

In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without <a href="digital%20rights%20management">digital rights management</a> (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology. On April 2, 2007, Apple and <a href="EMI">EMI</a> jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007. Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce the corresponding changes to the iTunes Store.

In July 2008, Apple launched the <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a> to sell third-party applications for the <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a>. Within a month, the store sold 60million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple. By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.

On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that 2009 would be the last year the corporation would attend the Macworld Expo, after more than 20 years of attendance, and that senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing <a href="Phil%20Schiller">Phil Schiller</a> would deliver the 2009 keynote address in lieu of the expected Jobs. The official press release explained that Apple was "scaling back" on trade shows in general, including Macworld Tokyo and the Apple Expo in Paris, France, primarily because the enormous successes of the Apple Retail Stores and website had rendered trade shows a minor promotional channel.

On January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical <a href="leave%20of%20absence">leave of absence</a> from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that "the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well", and explained that the break would allow the company "to focus on delivering extraordinary products". Despite Jobs's absence, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the <a href="late-2000s%20recession">recession</a> with revenue of $8.16billion and profit of $1.21billion.
After years of speculation and multiple rumored "leaks", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the <a href="iPad">iPad</a> on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and many iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, despite very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week. In May of the same year, Apple's <a href="market%20cap">market cap</a> exceeded that of competitor <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> for the first time since 1989.

In June 2010, Apple released the <a href="iPhone%204">iPhone 4</a>, which introduced <a href="video%20calling">video calling</a>, <a href="Computer%20multitasking">multitasking</a>, and a new <a href="Electrical%20insulation">uninsulated</a> <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> design that acted as the phone's antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a <a href="multi-touch">multi-touch</a> <a href="iPod%20Nano">iPod Nano</a>, an <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a> with <a href="FaceTime">FaceTime</a>, and an <a href="iPod%20Shuffle">iPod Shuffle</a> that brought back the buttons of earlier generations. Additionally, on October 20, Apple updated the <a href="MacBook%20Air">MacBook Air</a> laptop, <a href="iLife">iLife</a> suite of applications, and unveiled <a href="Mac%20OS%20X%20Lion">Mac OS X Lion</a>, the last version with the name "<a href="macOS">Mac OS X</a>".

In October 2010, Apple shares hit an all-time high, eclipsing $300.

On January 6, 2011, the company opened its <a href="Mac%20App%20Store">Mac App Store</a>, a digital software distribution platform similar to the iOS App Store.

Alongside peer entities such as Atari and Cisco Systems, Apple was featured in the documentary "<a href="Something%20Ventured%20%28film%29">Something Ventured</a>", which premiered in 2011 and explored the three-decade era that led to the establishment and dominance of Silicon Valley.

On January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief Operating Officer <a href="Tim%20Cook">Tim Cook</a> assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain "involved in major strategic decisions". Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world. In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled <a href="iCloud">iCloud</a>, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.

This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death. It has been argued that Apple has achieved such efficiency in its supply chain that the company operates as a <a href="monopsony">monopsony</a> (one buyer, many sellers) and can dictate terms to its suppliers. In July 2011, due to the <a href="United%20States%20debt-ceiling%20crisis%20of%202011">American debt-ceiling crisis</a>, Apple's financial reserves were briefly larger than those of the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Government</a>.

On August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple. He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Prior to this, Apple did not have a chairman and instead had two co-lead directors, <a href="Andrea%20Jung">Andrea Jung</a> and <a href="Arthur%20D.%20Levinson">Arthur D. Levinson</a>, who continued with those titles until Levinson became Chairman of the Board in November.

On October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs passed away, marking the end of an era for Apple. The first major product announcement by Apple following Jobs's passing occurred on January 19, 2012, when Apple's <a href="Phil%20Schiller">Phil Schiller</a> introduced iBooks Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City. Jobs had stated in his biography that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.

From 2011 to 2012, Apple released the <a href="iPhone%204S">iPhone 4S</a> and <a href="iPhone%205">iPhone 5</a>, which featured improved cameras, an <a href="Intelligent%20personal%20assistant">intelligent software assistant</a> named <a href="Siri">Siri</a>, and cloud-sourced data with iCloud; the <a href="iPad%20%28third%20generation%29">third</a> and <a href="iPad%20%28fourth%20generation%29">fourth</a> generation iPads, which featured <a href="Retina%20Display">Retina displays</a>; and the <a href="iPad%20Mini">iPad Mini</a>, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen. These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad (released November 3, 2012). Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch <a href="MacBook%20Pro">MacBook Pro</a> with a Retina display and new <a href="iMac">iMac</a> and <a href="Mac%20Mini">Mac Mini</a> computers.

On August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a world-record $624billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization set by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> in 1999. On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05billion (£665m) in damages in an <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> lawsuit. Samsung appealed the damages award, which the Court reduced by $450million. The Court further granted Samsung's request for a new trial. On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that would dismiss all lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies. It is predicted that Apple will make $280million a year from this deal with HTC.

A previously confidential email written by Jobs a year before his death was presented during the proceedings of the "<a href="Apple%20Inc.%20v.%20Samsung%20Electronics%20Co.">Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.</a>" lawsuits and became publicly available in early April 2014. With a subject line that reads "Top 100 – A," the email was sent only to the company's 100 most senior employees and outlines Jobs's vision of Apple Inc.'s future under 10 subheadings. Notably, Jobs declares a "Holy War with Google" for 2011 and schedules a "new campus" for 2015.

In March 2013, Apple filed a patent for an augmented reality (AR) system that can identify objects in a live video stream and present information corresponding to these objects through a computer-generated information layer overlaid on top of the real-world image. The company also made several high-profile hiring decisions in 2013. On July 2, 2013, Apple recruited <a href="Paul%20Deneve">Paul Deneve</a>, Belgian President and CEO of <a href="Yves%20Saint%20Laurent%20%28brand%29">Yves Saint Laurent</a> as a vice president reporting directly to Tim Cook. A mid-October 2013 announcement revealed that <a href="Burberry">Burberry</a> executive <a href="Angela%20Ahrendts">Angela Ahrendts</a> will commence as a senior vice president at Apple in mid-2014. Ahrendts oversaw Burberry's digital strategy for almost eight years and, during her tenure, sales increased to about US$3.2 billion and shares gained more than threefold.

Alongside Google vice-president Vint Cerf and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, Cook attended a closed-door summit held by President Obama on August 8, 2013, in regard to government surveillance and the Internet in the wake of the Edward Snowden <a href="Global%20surveillance%20disclosures%20%282013%E2%80%93present%29">NSA incident</a>. On February 4, 2014, Cook met with <a href="Abdullah%20G%C3%BCl">Abdullah Gül</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20Turkey">President of Turkey</a>, in <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a> to discuss the company's involvement in the <a href="Fatih%20project">Fatih project</a>.

In the first quarter of 2014, Apple reported sales of 51million iPhones and 26million iPads, becoming all-time quarterly sales records. It also experienced a significant year-over-year increase in Mac sales. This was contrasted with a significant drop in iPod sales. On May 28, 2014, Apple confirmed its intent to acquire <a href="Dr.%20Dre">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a>'s audio company <a href="Beats%20Electronics">Beats Electronics</a>—producer of the "Beats by Dr. Dre" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service <a href="Beats%20Music">Beats Music</a>—for $3billion, and to sell their products through Apple's retail outlets and resellers. Iovine felt that Beats had always "belonged" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's "unmatched ability to marry culture and technology." In August 2014, an Apple representative confirmed to the media that <a href="Anand%20Lal%20Shimpi">Anand Lal Shimpi</a>, editor and publisher of the "AnandTech" website, had been recruited by Apple without elaborating on Lal Shimpi's role.

Apple has been at the top of <a href="Interbrand">Interbrand</a>'s annual Best Global Brands report for 4 years in a row; 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, with a valuation of $178.1billion.

In January 2016, it was announced that one billion Apple devices are in active use worldwide.

On May 12, 2016, Apple Inc., invested <a href="US%24">US$</a>1billion in <a href="Didi%20Chuxing">Didi Chuxing</a>, a Chinese competitor to <a href="Uber%20%28company%29">Uber</a>. "The Information" reported in October 2016 that Apple had taken a board seat in Didi Chuxing, a move that James Vincent of "<a href="The%20Verge">The Verge</a>" speculated could be a strategic company decision by Apple to get closer to the automobile industry, particularly Didi Chuxing's reported interest in self-driving cars.

On June 6, 2016, Forbes released their list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year, Apple appeared on the list as the top tech company. It ranked third, overall, with $233billion in revenue. This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year's list.

On April 6, 2017, Apple launched <a href="Clips%20%28software%29">Clips</a>, an app that allows iPad and iPhone users to make and edit videos. The app provides a way to produce short videos to share with other users on the Messages app, <a href="Instagram">Instagram</a>, <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> and other social networks. Apple also introduced Live Titles for Clips that allows users to add live animated captions and titles using their voice.

Towards the end of May 2017, Apple refreshed two of its website designs. Its <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> "Apple Press Info" website was changed to a new "Apple Newsroom" site, featuring a greater emphasis on imagery and therefore lower information density, and combines press releases, news items and photos. Its "Apple Leadership" overview of company executives was also refreshed, adding a simpler layout with a prominent header image and two-column text fields. "9to5Mac" noted the design similarities to several of Apple's redesigned apps in <a href="iOS%2010">iOS 10</a>, particularly its <a href="Apple%20Music">Apple Music</a> and <a href="News%20%28Apple%29">News</a> software.

On June 9, 2017, Apple held the keynote for <a href="Apple%20Worldwide%20Developers%20Conference">WWDC 2017</a> at the <a href="San%20Jose%20Convention%20Center">San Jose Convention Center</a> and introduced <a href="iOS%2011">iOS 11</a>, <a href="macOS%20High%20Sierra">macOS High Sierra</a>, and <a href="WatchOS">watchOS 4</a> along with hardware improvements to the <a href="MacBook%20%28Retina%29">MacBook 12"</a>, <a href="MacBook%20Pro">MacBook Pro</a> laptops and the <a href="iMac">iMac</a> <a href="All-in-one%20PC">all-in-one</a>. New hardware launches included the <a href="iMac%20Pro">iMac Pro workstation-class all-in-one</a>, a redesigned <a href="IPad%20Pro">10.5" iPad Pro</a>, and the <a href="HomePod">HomePod smart speaker</a>.

Macs currently in production:
Apple sells a variety of computer accessories for Macs, including <a href="Apple%20Thunderbolt%20Display">Thunderbolt Display</a>, <a href="Magic%20Mouse">Magic Mouse</a>, <a href="Magic%20Trackpad">Magic Trackpad</a>, <a href="Magic%20Keyboard">Magic Keyboard</a>, the AirPort wireless networking products, and <a href="Apple%20Time%20Capsule">Time Capsule</a>.

On October 23, 2001, Apple introduced the <a href="iPod">iPod</a> digital music player. Several updated models have since been introduced, and the iPod brand is now the market leader in portable music players by a significant margin. More than 350million units have shipped . Apple has partnered with <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> to offer the <a href="Nike%2BiPod">Nike+iPod</a> Sports Kit, enabling runners to synchronize and monitor their runs with iTunes and the Nike+ website.

In late July 2017, Apple discontinued its <a href="iPod%20Nano">iPod Nano</a> and <a href="iPod%20Shuffle">iPod Shuffle</a> models, leaving only the <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a> available for purchase.

At the <a href="Macworld%20Conference%20%26amp%3B%20Expo">Macworld Conference & Expo</a> in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the long-anticipated <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a>, a convergence of an Internet-enabled <a href="smartphone">smartphone</a> and iPod. The <a href="iPhone%20%281st%20generation%29">first-generation iPhone</a> was released on June 29, 2007, for $499 (4 GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Inc.">AT&T</a> contract. On February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of memory, in addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models. It combined a <a href="2.5G">2.5G</a> <a href="quad%20band">quad band</a> <a href="GSM">GSM</a> and <a href="Enhanced%20Data%20Rates%20for%20GSM%20Evolution">EDGE</a> cellular phone with features found in handheld devices, running scaled-down versions of Apple's <a href="macOS">Mac OS X</a> (dubbed iPhone OS, later renamed <a href="iOS">iOS</a>), with various Mac OS X applications such as <a href="Safari%20%28web%20browser%29">Safari</a> and <a href="Mail%20%28Apple%29">Mail</a>. It also includes web-based and <a href="Dashboard%20%28macOS%29">Dashboard</a> apps such as <a href="Google%20Maps">Google Maps</a> and <a href="Dashboard%20%28macOS%29">Weather</a>. The iPhone features a touchscreen display, <a href="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a>, and <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> (both "b" and "g").

A second version, the <a href="iPhone%203G">iPhone 3G</a>, was released on July 11, 2008, with a reduced price of $199 for the 8 GB version and $299 for the 16 GB version. This version added support for <a href="3G">3G</a> networking and <a href="assisted%20GPS">assisted GPS</a> navigation. The flat silver back and large antenna square of the original model were eliminated in favor of a glossy, curved black or white back. Software capabilities were improved with the release of the <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a>, which provided iPhone-compatible applications to download. On April 24, 2009, the App Store surpassed one billion downloads. On June 8, 2009, Apple announced the <a href="iPhone%203GS">iPhone 3GS</a>. It provided an incremental update to the device, including faster internal components, support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capability, and voice control.

At the <a href="Apple%20Worldwide%20Developers%20Conference">Worldwide Developers Conference</a> (WWDC) on June 7, 2010, Apple announced the redesigned <a href="iPhone%204">iPhone 4</a>. It featured a 960 × 640 display, the <a href="Apple%20A4">Apple A4</a> processor, a <a href="gyroscope">gyroscope</a> for enhanced gaming, a 5MP camera with LED flash, front-facing <a href="VGA">VGA</a> camera and <a href="FaceTime">FaceTime</a> video calling. Shortly after its release, reception issues were discovered by consumers, due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phone's cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. The issue was corrected by a "Bumper Case" distributed by Apple for free to all owners for a few months. In June 2011, Apple overtook <a href="Nokia">Nokia</a> to become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume. On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the <a href="iPhone%204S">iPhone 4S</a>, which was first released on October 14, 2011. It features the <a href="Apple%20A5">Apple A5</a> processor and <a href="Siri">Siri</a> voice assistant technology, the latter of which Apple had acquired in 2010. It also features an updated 8MP camera with new optics. Apple began a new <a href="accessibility">accessibility</a> feature, Made for iPhone <a href="Hearing%20aid">Hearing Aids</a> with the iPhone 4S. Made for iPhone Hearing Aids feature Live Listen, it can help the user hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room. Apple sold 4million iPhone 4S phones in the first three days of availability.

On September 12, 2012, Apple introduced the <a href="iPhone%205">iPhone 5</a>. It has a 4-inch display, 4G LTE connectivity, and the upgraded <a href="Apple%20A6">Apple A6</a> chip, among several other improvements. Two million iPhones were sold in the first twenty-four hours of pre-ordering and over five million handsets were sold in the first three days of its launch. Upon the launch of the <a href="iPhone%205S">iPhone 5S</a> and <a href="iPhone%205C">iPhone 5C</a>, Apple set a new record for first-weekend smartphone sales by selling over nine million devices in the first three days of its launch. The release of the iPhone 5S and 5C was the first time that Apple simultaneously launched two models.

A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.

In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer <a href="Jonathan%20Ive">Jonathan Ive</a> used the iPhone as an example of Apple's ethos of creating high-quality, life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them:

On September 9, 2014, Apple introduced the <a href="iPhone%206">iPhone 6</a>, alongside the <a href="iPhone%206%20Plus">iPhone 6 Plus</a> that both have screen sizes over 4-inches. One year later, Apple introduced the <a href="iPhone%206S">iPhone 6S</a>, and <a href="iPhone%206S%20Plus">iPhone 6S Plus</a>, which introduced a new technology called 3D Touch, including an increase of the rear camera to 12 MP, and the FaceTime camera to 5 MP. On March 21, 2016, Apple introduced the <a href="iPhone%20SE">iPhone SE</a> that has a 4-inch screen size last used with the 5S and has nearly the same internal hardware as the 6S.

In July 2016, Apple announced that one billion iPhones had been sold.
On September 7, 2016, Apple introduced the <a href="iPhone%207">iPhone 7</a> and the <a href="IPhone%207">iPhone 7 Plus</a>, which feature improved system and graphics performance, add water resistance, a new rear dual-camera system on the 7 Plus model, and, controversially, remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack.

On September 12, 2017, Apple introduced the <a href="iPhone%208">iPhone 8</a> and <a href="iPhone%208">iPhone 8 Plus</a>, along with the high-end <a href="iPhone%20X">iPhone X</a>, which features no home button, near bezel-less design, and other advanced technologies like <a href="Face%20ID">Face ID</a> facial recognition and <a href="wireless%20charging">wireless charging</a>.

On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media <a href="tablet%20computer">tablet</a>, the <a href="iPad">iPad</a>. It offers multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch screen. It also includes a mobile version of <a href="Safari%20%28web%20browser%29">Safari</a> for web browsing, as well as access to the App Store, <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> Library, <a href="iBookstore">iBookstore</a>, Contacts, and Notes. Content is downloadable via <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> and optional <a href="3G">3G</a> service or synced through the user's computer. <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Inc.">AT&T</a> was initially the sole U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.

On March 2, 2011, Apple introduced the <a href="iPad%202">iPad 2</a>, which had a faster processor and a camera on the front and back. It also added support for optional 3G service provided by <a href="Verizon%20Wireless">Verizon</a> in addition to <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Inc.">AT&T</a>. The availability of the iPad 2 was initially limited as a result of a devastating <a href="2011%20T%C5%8Dhoku%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">earthquake and tsunami</a> in Japan in March 2011.

The third-generation iPad was released on March 7, 2012, and marketed as "<a href="iPad%20%283rd%20generation%29">the new iPad</a>". It added <a href="LTE%20%28telecommunication%29">LTE</a> service from AT&T or Verizon, an upgraded <a href="Apple%20A5X">A5X</a> processor, and Retina display. The dimensions and form factor remained relatively unchanged, with the new iPad being a fraction thicker and heavier than the previous version and featuring minor positioning changes.

On October 23, 2012, Apple's fourth-generation iPad came out, marketed as the "<a href="iPad%20%284th%20generation%29">iPad with Retina display</a>". It added the upgraded <a href="Apple%20A6X">A6X</a> processor and replaced the traditional 30-pin dock connector with the all-digital <a href="Lightning%20%28connector%29">Lightning connector</a>. The <a href="iPad%20Mini">iPad Mini</a> was also introduced. It featured a reduced 7.9-inch display and much of the same internal specifications as the iPad 2.

On October 22, 2013, Apple introduced the <a href="iPad%20Air">iPad Air</a> and the iPad Mini with Retina Display, both featuring a new 64-bit Apple A7 processor.

The <a href="iPad%20Air%202">iPad Air 2</a> was unveiled on October 16, 2014. It added better graphics and central processing and a camera burst mode as well as minor updates. The <a href="iPad%20Mini%203">iPad Mini 3</a> was unveiled at the same time.

Since its launch, iPad users have downloaded over three billion apps. The total number of App Store downloads, , is over 100billion.

On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the <a href="iPad%20Pro">iPad Pro</a>, an iPad with a 12.9-inch display that supports two new accessories, the <a href="Smart%20Keyboard">Smart Keyboard</a> and <a href="Apple%20Pencil">Apple Pencil</a>. An updated <a href="IPad%20Mini%204">IPad Mini 4</a> was announced at the same time. A 9.7-inch iPad Pro was announced on March 21, 2016. On June 5, 2017, Apple announced a new iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch display to replace the 9.7 inch model and an updated 12.9-inch model.

The Apple Watch <a href="smartwatch">smartwatch</a> was announced by Cook on September 9, 2014, and released on April 24, 2015. The wearable device consists of fitness-tracking capabilities that are similar to <a href="Fitbit">Fitbit</a>, and must be used in combination with an iPhone to work (only the <a href="iPhone%205">iPhone 5</a>, or later models, are compatible with the Apple Watch).

The second generation of Apple Watch, <a href="Apple%20Watch%20Series%202">Apple Watch Series 2</a> and Apple Watch Series 1 were released in September 2016.

On September 12, 2017, Apple introduced <a href="Apple%20Watch%20Series%203">Apple Watch Series 3</a> featuring <a href="LTE%20%28telecommunications%29">LTE</a> cellular connectivity.

At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the <a href="Apple%20TV">Apple TV</a> (previously known as the iTV), a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40 GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for <a href="HDMI">HDMI</a> and <a href="component%20video">component video</a>, and played video at a maximum resolution of <a href="720p">720p</a>. On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model. A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> to <a href="cache%20%28computing%29">cache</a> media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the <a href="iPhone%204">iPhone 4</a> at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a>.

It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a>, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

At the September 9, 2015, event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a variant of <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, called <a href="tvOS">tvOS</a>, and contains 32GB or 64 GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing. The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new <a href="Siri%20Remote">Siri Remote</a> with a glass <a href="touchpad">touchpad</a>, <a href="gyroscope">gyroscope</a>, and <a href="microphone">microphone</a>.

At the September 12, 2017 event, Apple released a new <a href="4K%20resolution">4K</a> Apple TV with the same form factor as the 4th Generation model. The 4K model is powered by the <a href="Apple%20A10X">A10X</a> SoC designed in-house that also powers their second-generation iPad Pro. The 4K model also has support for <a href="high%20dynamic%20range">high dynamic range</a>.

Apple develops its own <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s to run on its devices, including <a href="macOS">macOS</a> for Mac personal computers, <a href="iOS">iOS</a> for its iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch smartphones and tablets, <a href="watchOS">watchOS</a> for its Apple Watch smartwatches, and <a href="tvOS">tvOS</a> for its Apple TV digital media player.

For iOS and macOS, Apple also develops its own software titles, including <a href="Pages%20%28word%20processor%29">Pages</a> for writing, <a href="Numbers%20%28spreadsheet%29">Numbers</a> for spreadsheets, and <a href="Keynote%20%28presentation%20software%29">Keynote</a> for presentations, as part of its <a href="iWork">iWork</a> productivity suite. For macOS, it also offers <a href="iMovie">iMovie</a> and <a href="Final%20Cut%20Pro%20X">Final Cut Pro X</a> for video editing, and <a href="GarageBand">GarageBand</a> and <a href="Logic%20Pro%20X">Logic Pro X</a> for music creation.

Apple's range of server software includes the operating system <a href="macOS%20Server">macOS Server</a>; <a href="Apple%20Remote%20Desktop">Apple Remote Desktop</a>, a remote systems management application; and <a href="Xsan">Xsan</a>, a <a href="storage%20area%20network">storage area network</a> file system.

Apple also offers online services with <a href="iCloud">iCloud</a>, which provides <a href="File%20hosting%20service">cloud storage</a> and synchronization for a wide range of user data, including documents, photos, music, device backups, and application data, and <a href="Apple%20Music">Apple Music</a>, its music <a href="Streaming%20media">streaming service</a>.

According to the "<a href="Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a>", Apple wants to start producing an <a href="electric%20car">electric car</a> with <a href="autonomous%20driving">autonomous driving</a> as soon as 2020. Apple has made efforts to recruit battery development engineers and other electric automobile engineers from <a href="A123%20Systems">A123 Systems</a>, <a href="LG%20Chem">LG Chem</a>, <a href="Samsung%20Electronics">Samsung Electronics</a>, <a href="Panasonic">Panasonic</a>, <a href="Toshiba">Toshiba</a>, <a href="Johnson%20Controls">Johnson Controls</a> and <a href="Tesla%20Motors">Tesla Motors</a>.

Apple Energy, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells <a href="solar%20energy">solar energy</a>. As of June 6, 2016, Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity. In addition to the company's solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a <a href="Landfill%20gas%20utilization">landfill gas energy plant</a> in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. Apple will use the <a href="methane">methane</a> emissions to generate electricity. Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a <a href="fruitarian">fruitarian</a> diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".

Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts <a href="Sir%20Isaac%20Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</a> sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by <a href="Rob%20Janoff">Rob Janoff</a>'s "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company. The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry. The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color. This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>, with the bite mark a reference to <a href="Alan%20Turing%23Death">his method of suicide</a>. Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.

On August 27, 1999 (the year following the introduction of the <a href="iMac%20G3">iMac G3</a>), Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation. An <a href="Aqua%20%28user%20interface%29">Aqua</a>-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 1998 to 2003, and a glass-themed version was used from 2007 to 2013.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatles</a> fans, but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with <a href="Apple%20Corps">Apple Corps Ltd.</a>, a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1967. This resulted in a <a href="Apple%20Corps%20v%20Apple%20Computer">series of lawsuits</a> and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007.

Apple's first slogan, "<a href="Byte">Byte</a> into an Apple", was coined in the late 1970s. From 1997 to 2002, the slogan "<a href="Think%20Different">Think Different</a>" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple. Apple also has slogans for specific product lines — for example, "iThink, therefore iMac" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac, and "Say hello to iPhone" has been used in iPhone advertisements. "Hello" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, <a href="Newton%20%28platform%29">Newton</a>, iMac ("hello (again)"), and iPod.

From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the <a href="1984%20%28television%20commercial%29">1984 Super Bowl commercial</a> to the more modern '<a href="Get%20a%20Mac">Get a Mac</a>' adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns <a href="Apple%20Inc.%20advertising%23Criticism">were criticized</a>, particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads. Apple's product commercials gained a lot of attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes. Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple commercials include Canadian singer <a href="Feist%20%28singer%29">Feist</a> with the song "<a href="1234%20%28Feist%20song%29">1234</a>" and <a href="Yael%20Naim">Yael Naïm</a> with the song "<a href="New%20Soul">New Soul</a>".

Apple owns a YouTube channel where they have advertisements, tips, and introductions to their devices.

Apple customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the company's history. "<a href="BYTE">BYTE</a>" in 1984 stated that

<a href="Apple%20evangelist">Apple evangelist</a>s were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple <a href="Evangelism%20marketing">evangelist</a> <a href="Guy%20Kawasaki">Guy Kawasaki</a> has called the brand fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon," while Ive explained in 2014 that "People have an incredibly personal relationship" with Apple's products. <a href="Apple%20Store">Apple Store</a> openings and new product releases can draw crowds of hundreds, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening. The opening of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> "Cube" store in 2006 became the setting of a marriage proposal, and had visitors from Europe who flew in for the event. In June 2017, a newlywed couple took their wedding photos inside the then-recently-opened Orchard Road Apple Store in Singapore. The high level of brand loyalty has been criticized and ridiculed, applying the epithet "<a href="Apple%20fanboy">Apple fanboy</a>" and mocking the lengthy lines before a product launch. An internal memo leaked in 2015 suggested the company planned to discourage long lines and direct customers to purchase its products on its website.

"<a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">Fortune</a>" magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012. On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> to become the world's most valuable brand in the <a href="Omnicom%20Group">Omnicom Group</a>'s "Best Global Brands" report. <a href="Boston%20Consulting%20Group">Boston Consulting Group</a> has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year since 2005.

"The New York Times" in 1985 stated that "Apple above all else is a marketing company". John Sculley agreed, telling "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" newspaper in 1997 that "People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade." Research in 2002 by <a href="Nielsen%20Online">NetRatings</a> indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers. The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc. products were more expensive than other PC products.

In response to a query about the devotion of loyal Apple consumers, Jonathan Ive responded:
What people are responding to is much bigger than the object. They are responding to something rare—a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can. It's a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness.

The Apple website <a href="home%20page">home page</a> has been used to commemorate, or pay tribute to, milestones and events outside of Apple's product offerings:

Apple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of <a href="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, at 1–6 <a href="Infinite%20Loop%20%28street%29">Infinite Loop</a>, <a href="Cupertino%2C%20California">Cupertino</a>, California. This Apple campus has six buildings that total and was built in 1993 by Sobrato Development Cos.

Apple has a satellite campus in neighboring <a href="Sunnyvale%2C%20California">Sunnyvale, California</a>, where it houses a testing and research laboratory. <a href="AppleInsider">AppleInsider</a> published article in March 2014 claiming that Apple has a tucked away a top-secret facility where is developing the SG5 electric vehicle project codenamed "Titan" under the shell company name <a href="SixtyEight%20Research">SixtyEight Research</a>.

In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a <a href="Apple%20Park">second campus</a> in Cupertino about east of the current campus and next to Interstate 280. The new campus building has been designed by <a href="Norman%20Foster">Norman Foster</a>. The Cupertino City Council approved the proposed "spaceship" design campus on October 15, 2013, after a 2011 presentation by Jobs detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central, four-storied, circular building surrounded by extensive landscape. It will feature a café with room for 3,000 sitting people and parking underground as well as in a parking structure. The 2.8million square foot facility will also include Jobs's original designs for a fitness center and a corporate auditorium.

Apple has expanded its campuses in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a> concurrently with building Apple Park in Cupertino. The expansion consists of two locations, with one having 1.1 million square feet of workspace, and the other 216,000 square feet. At the biggest location, 6,000 employees work on technical support, manage Apple's network of suppliers to fulfill product shipments, aid in maintaining <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> and <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a>, handle economy, and continuously update <a href="Apple%20Maps">Apple Maps</a> with new data. At its smaller campus, 500 engineers work on next-generation processor chips to run in future Apple products.

Apple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a> in the south of <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>. The facility, which opened in 1980, was Apple's first location outside of the United States. Apple Sales International, which deals with all of Apple's international sales outside of the USA, is located at Apple's campus in Cork along with Apple Distribution International, which similarly deals with Apple's international distribution network. On April 20, 2012, Apple added 500 new jobs at its European headquarters, increasing the total workforce from around 2,800 to 3,300 employees. The company will build a new office block on its Hollyhill Campus to accommodate the additional staff. Its <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> headquarters is at <a href="Stockley%20Park">Stockley Park</a> on the outskirts of <a href="London">London</a>.

In February 2015, Apple opened their new 180,000-square-foot headquarters in <a href="Herzliya">Herzliya</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, which will accommodate approximately 800 employees. This opening was Apple's third office located within Israel; the first, also in Herzliya, was obtained as part of the <a href="Anobit">Anobit</a> acquisition, and the other is a research center in <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a>.

In December 2015, Apple bought the 70,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in North San Jose previously used by <a href="Maxim%20Integrated">Maxim Integrated</a>, in an $18.2 million deal.

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-<a href="CEO">CEO</a> Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired <a href="Ron%20Johnson%20%28businessman%29">Ron Johnson</a> in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997, and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. Despite initial media speculation that Apple would fail, its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Over the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 498 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of July 2017. Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.

In May 2016, <a href="Angela%20Ahrendts">Angela Ahrendts</a>, Apple's current Senior Vice President of Retail, unveiled a significantly redesigned Apple Store in <a href="Union%20Square%2C%20San%20Francisco">Union Square</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, featuring large glass doors for the entry, open spaces, and rebranded rooms. In addition to purchasing products, consumers can get advice and help from "Creative Pros" – individuals with specialized knowledge of creative arts; get product support in a tree-lined Genius Grove; and attend sessions, conferences and community events, with Ahrendts commenting that the goal is to make Apple Stores into "town squares", a place where people naturally meet up and spend time. The new design will be applied to all Apple Stores worldwide, a process that has seen stores temporarily relocate or close.

Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone "flagship" stores in high-profile locations. It has been granted design <a href="patent">patent</a>s and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes. The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores. Apple's notable brand loyalty among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new Apple Store openings or product releases. Due to the popularity of the brand, there are numerous job applications, many of which from young workers. Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts, there are limited or no paths of career advancement. A May 2016 report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a <a href="hostile%20work%20environment">hostile work environment</a> with harassment from customers, intense internal criticism, and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts.

Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of <a href="corporate%20culture">corporate culture</a>. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a <a href="Fortune%20500">Fortune 500</a> company. By the time of the "1984" television commercial, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors. According to a 2011 report in "<a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">Fortune</a>," this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.

As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than projects with it. 

To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to <a href="personal%20computing">personal computing</a> while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including <a href="Bill%20Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a>, <a href="Steve%20Capps">Steve Capps</a>, <a href="Rod%20Holt">Rod Holt</a>, <a href="Alan%20Kay">Alan Kay</a>, <a href="Guy%20Kawasaki">Guy Kawasaki</a>, <a href="Al%20Alcorn">Al Alcorn</a>, <a href="Don%20Norman">Don Norman</a>, <a href="Rich%20Page">Rich Page</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>.
At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having "best-in-class" employees in every role. For instance, <a href="Ron%20Johnson%20%28businessman%29">Ron Johnson</a>—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management). Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a "directly responsible individual," or "DRI" in Apple jargon. As an example, when iOS senior vice president <a href="Scott%20Forstall">Scott Forstall</a> refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned <a href="Apple%20Maps">Maps app</a>, he was forced to resign. Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.

In 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 <a href="U.S.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">SEC</a> filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.

An editorial article in "<a href="The%20Verge">The Verge</a>" in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has "matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design" and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating "Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the "excitement of revolution", but argues that people want "the comfort that comes with harmony". Furthermore, he writes that "a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that <a href="Walkman">Walkman</a> didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the <a href="iCloud">iCloud</a> cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an <a href="Apple%20Watch">Apple Watch</a> can unlock a <a href="Macintosh">Mac</a> in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.

Apple has a strong culture of <a href="corporate%20secrecy">corporate secrecy</a>, and has an anti-<a href="News%20leak">leak</a> Global Security team that recruits from the <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a>, the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">United States Secret Service</a>.

The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: "Nobody wants to buy sour milk".

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own. This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the <a href="Peripheral%20Component%20Interconnect">PCI</a> bus in the <a href="Power%20Macintosh%207500">7500</a>/<a href="Power%20Macintosh%208500">8500</a>/<a href="Power%20Macintosh%209500">9500</a> <a href="Power%20Macintosh">Power Macs</a>. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as <a href="USB">USB</a>, <a href="Accelerated%20Graphics%20Port">AGP</a>, <a href="HyperTransport">HyperTransport</a>, <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a>, <a href="NVM%20Express">NVMe</a>, <a href="PCI%20Express">PCIe</a> and others in its products. <a href="FireWire">FireWire</a> is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as <a href="IEEE%201394">IEEE 1394</a> and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.

Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO <a href="Tim%20Cook">Tim Cook</a> said that he "[loves] India", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region. India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as "really adds cost to getting product to market". In October 2013, Indian Apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and <a href="store-within-a-store">store-within-a-store</a> concepts, in an effort to expand further into the market. The news followed Cook's acknowledgment of the country in July when sales results showed that iPhone sales in India grew 400% during the second quarter of 2013. In March 2016, "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" reported that Apple had sought permission from the Indian government to sell <a href="Refurbishment%20%28electronics%29">refurbished</a> iPhones in the country. However, two months later, the application was rejected, citing official country policy. In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>. In February 2017, Apple once again requested permission to sell used iPhones in the country. The same month, "<a href="Bloomberg%20L.P.">Bloomberg</a>" reported that Apple was close to receiving permission to open its first retail store in the country. In March, "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India "over the next two months", and in May, the "Journal" wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of <a href="iPhone%20SE">iPhone SE</a> in the country, while Apple told "<a href="CNBC">CNBC</a>" that the manufacturing was for a "small number" of units.

The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of <a href="outsourcing">outsourcing</a> initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Apple insiders "believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that "Made in the U.S.A." is no longer a viable option for most Apple products".

In 2006, the "<a href="Mail%20on%20Sunday">Mail on Sunday</a>" reported on the working conditions of the Chinese factories where contract manufacturers <a href="Foxconn">Foxconn</a> and <a href="Inventec">Inventec</a> produced the iPod. The article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.

Apple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions. In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding <a href="worker%27s%20rights">worker's rights</a>, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published since 2008. In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.

The <a href="Foxconn%20suicides">Foxconn suicides</a> occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 <a href="Foxconn">Foxconn</a> (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted <a href="suicide">suicide</a>, resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time. The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple. Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:
[Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.

The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories. Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.

Also in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses. After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole, workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves. Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to n-<a href="hexane">hexane</a>, a <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a> that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: "We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions".

In December 2014, the <a href="Institute%20for%20Global%20Labour%20and%20Human%20Rights">Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights</a> published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in "primitive, dark and filthy dorms" where they sleep "on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room." Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.

Following a <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy. By 2013 Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.

In 2010, <a href="Climate%20Counts">Climate Counts</a>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category "Striding". This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a "stuck icon", adding that Apple at the time was "a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer".

, Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a>, 100% of Apple's <a href="data%20center">data center</a>s run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy. However, the facilities are connected to the local <a href="Electrical%20grid">grid</a> which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple <a href="carbon%20offset">carbon offset</a>s its electricity use. The <a href="Electronic%20Product%20Environmental%20Assessment%20Tool">Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool</a> (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple <a href="Tablet%20computer">tablet</a>, <a href="Laptop">notebook</a>, <a href="desktop%20computer">desktop computer</a>, and <a href="Computer%20monitor">display</a> that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times, the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573million gallons in 2015.

In May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, "Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet."

During an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. <a href="Lisa%20P.%20Jackson">Lisa P. Jackson</a>, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from <a href="Post-consumer">post-consumer recycled</a> paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products. Apple working in partnership with <a href="The%20Conservation%20Fund">Conservation Fund</a>, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in <a href="Maine">Maine</a> and <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. Another partnership announced is with the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wildlife Fund</a> to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 <a href="Megawatt">MW</a> <a href="Solar%20power">solar power plant</a> in the <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a> province of <a href="China">China</a> that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.

Apple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its <a href="glass%20production">glass production</a> for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China. Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with <a href="UL%20%28safety%20organization%29">UL's</a> Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is <a href="reuse">reuse</a>d, <a href="Recycling">recycled</a>, <a href="compost">compost</a>ed, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly, 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from <a href="landfill">landfill</a>s.

Following further campaigns by Greenpeace, in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to fully eliminate all <a href="polyvinyl%20chloride">polyvinyl chloride</a> (PVC) and <a href="brominated%20flame%20retardant">brominated flame retardant</a>s (BFRs) in its complete product line. In June 2007, Apple began replacing the <a href="cold%20cathode">cold cathode</a> fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit <a href="LCD">LCD</a> displays in its computers with <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>-free <a href="LED-backlit%20LCD%20display">LED-backlit LCD display</a>s and <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>-free glass, starting with the upgraded <a href="MacBook%20Pro">MacBook Pro</a>. Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the <a href="Carbon%20dioxide%20equivalent">COe</a>, <a href="Greenhouse%20gas%23Direct%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions">emissions</a>, materials, and <a href="Electric%20energy%20consumption">electrical usage</a> concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale. In June 2009, Apple's <a href="iPhone%203GS">iPhone 3GS</a> was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs. All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.

In November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how "green" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10. Greenpeace praises Apple's <a href="Sustainability%20metrics%20and%20indices">sustainability</a>, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions. In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing <a href="Halogen-free%20substance">halogen-free</a> <a href="USB">USB</a> and power cables.

In February 2016, Apple issued a US$1.5billion <a href="green%20bond">green bond</a> (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.

Apple is the <a href="List%20of%20the%20largest%20information%20technology%20companies">world's largest information technology company</a> by revenue, the world's largest technology company by <a href="asset">total assets</a>, and the <a href="Mobile%20phone%23By%20manufacturer">world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer</a> after <a href="Samsung">Samsung</a>. It is also the <a href="List%20of%20corporations%20by%20market%20capitalization">largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization</a>, with an estimated market capitalization of $800 billion in May 2017. In February 2015, Apple became the first U.S. corporation to be valued at over $700 billion.

In its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65billion—and nearly $82billion in <a href="Reserve%20%28accounting%29">cash reserves</a>. On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share <a href="dividend">dividend</a> beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors. On September 2012, Apple reached a record share price of more than $705 and closed at above 700. With 936,596,000 outstanding shares (),

The company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170billion. In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the <a href="Fortune%20500">Fortune 500</a> list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position. , Apple has around US$234billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.

Apple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by <a href="Canaccord%20Genuity">Canaccord Genuity</a>. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.

On April 30, 2017, "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" reported that Apple had <a href="cash%20reserve">cash reserve</a>s of $250 billion, officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8 billion a few days later. Coupled with a strong <a href="market%20capitalization">market capitalization</a> around the same time, reports predicted Apple will soon become the world's first $1 trillion dollar company.

Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> and the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">British Virgin Islands</a> to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to "The New York Times," in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the "<a href="Double%20Irish%20with%20a%20Dutch%20sandwich">Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich</a>," which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.

<a href="British%20Conservative%20Party">British Conservative Party</a> Member of Parliament <a href="Charlie%20Elphicke">Charlie Elphicke</a> published research on October 30, 2012, which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard <a href="corporation%20tax">corporation tax</a>. He followed this research by calling on the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="George%20Osborne">George Osborne</a> to force these multinationals, which also included <a href="Google">Google</a> and <a href="The%20Coca-Cola%20Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a>, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.

It is a matter of <a href="Public%20records">public record</a> that Apple Inc. is the single largest taxpayer to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Department of the Treasury</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a> with an <a href="Tax%20rate">effective tax rate</a> of approximately of 26% as of the Second Quarter of the Apple <a href="Fiscal%20year">Fiscal Year</a> 2016.

In 2015, <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4billion which were untaxed by the <a href="IRS">IRS</a> of the United States. Under U.S. tax law governed by the <a href="Tax%20law">IRC</a>, corporations don't pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the United States and as such Apple argues that to benefit its <a href="shareholder">shareholder</a>s it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the United States.

On August 30, 2016, after <a href="Investigation%20of%20Apple%27s%20transfer%20pricing%20arrangements%20with%20Ireland">a three-year investigation</a> by the EU's competition commissioner that concluded that Apple received "illegal state aid" from Ireland, the EU ordered Apple to pay 13billion euros ($14.5billion), plus interest, in unpaid taxes. Specifically, the commissioner found that Apple had benefitted from Irish Department of Revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by Apple Sales International internally between its Irish branch and a stateless "head office" entity lacking employees or premises (permitted under Irish law until 2013). The Chancellor of <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="Christian%20Kern">Christian Kern</a>, put this decision into perspective by stating that "every <a href="Vienna">Viennese</a> cafe, every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation".

Aberdeenshire

Aberdeenshire () is one of the 32 <a href="Subdivisions%20of%20Scotland%23council%20areas%20of%20Scotland">council areas of Scotland</a>.

It takes its name from the old <a href="County%20of%20Aberdeen">County of Aberdeen</a> which had substantially different boundaries. Modern Aberdeenshire includes all of what was once <a href="Kincardineshire">Kincardineshire</a>, as well as part of <a href="Banffshire">Banffshire</a>. The old boundaries are still officially used for a few purposes, namely land registration and <a href="Lieutenancy%20areas%20of%20Scotland">lieutenancy</a>.

Aberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House, in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, making it the only Scottish council whose headquarters are located outside its jurisdiction. Aberdeen itself forms a different council area (Aberdeen City). Aberdeenshire borders onto <a href="Angus%2C%20Scotland">Angus</a> and <a href="Perth%20and%20Kinross">Perth and Kinross</a> to the south, <a href="Highland%20%28council%20area%29">Highland</a> and <a href="Moray">Moray</a> to the west and Aberdeen City to the east.

Traditionally, it has been economically dependent upon the primary sector (agriculture, fishing, and forestry) and related processing industries. Over the last 40 years, the development of the oil and gas industry and associated service sector has broadened Aberdeenshire's economic base, and contributed to a rapid population growth of some 50% since 1975. Its land represents 8% of Scotland's overall territory. It covers an area of .

Aberdeenshire has a rich prehistoric and historic heritage. It is the locus of a large number of <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> and <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> archaeological sites, including <a href="Longman%20Hill">Longman Hill</a>, <a href="Kempstone%20Hill">Kempstone Hill</a>, <a href="Catto%20Long%20Barrow">Catto Long Barrow</a> and <a href="Cairn%20Lee">Cairn Lee</a>. The area was settled in the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> by the <a href="Beaker%20culture">Beaker culture</a>, who arrived from the south around 2000-1800 BC. Stone circles and cairns were constructed predominantly in this era. In the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, hill forts were built. Around the 1st century AD, the <a href="Taexali">Taexali</a> people, who have left little history, were believed to have resided along the coast. The <a href="Picts">Picts</a> were the next documented inhabitants of the area, and were no later than 800-900 AD. The <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a> also were in the area during this period, as they left signs at <a href="Kintore%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Kintore</a>. Christianity influenced the inhabitants early on, and there were <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> monasteries at <a href="Old%20Deer">Old Deer</a> and <a href="Monymusk">Monymusk</a>.

Since <a href="medieval">medieval</a> times there have been a number of traditional paths that crossed the <a href="Mounth">Mounth</a> (a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> slightly north of <a href="Stonehaven">Stonehaven</a>) through present-day Aberdeenshire from the Scottish Lowlands to the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highlands</a>. Some of the most well known and historically important <a href="trackway">trackway</a>s are the <a href="Causey%20Mounth">Causey Mounth</a> and <a href="Elsick%20Mounth">Elsick Mounth</a>.

Aberdeenshire played an important role in the fighting between the Scottish <a href="clan">clan</a>s. <a href="Clan%20MacBeth">Clan MacBeth</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Dunkeld">Clan Canmore</a> were two of the larger clans. Macbeth fell at <a href="Lumphanan">Lumphanan</a> in 1057. During the <a href="Anglo-Norman">Anglo-Norman</a> penetration, other families arrives such as <a href="House%20of%20Balliol">House of Balliol</a>, <a href="Clan%20Bruce">Clan Bruce</a>, and <a href="Clan%20Cumming">Clan Cumming</a> (Comyn). When the fighting amongst these newcomers resulted in the <a href="Scottish%20Wars%20of%20Independence">Scottish Wars of Independence</a>, the English king <a href="Edward%20I">Edward I</a> traveled across the area twice, in 1296 and 1303. In 1307, <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> was victorious near <a href="Inverurie">Inverurie</a>. Along with his victory came new families, namely the <a href="Clan%20Forbes">Forbeses</a> and the <a href="Clan%20Gordon">Gordons</a>.

These new families set the stage for the upcoming rivalries during the 14th and 15th centuries. This rivalry grew worse during and after the Protestant Reformation, when religion was another reason for conflict between the clans. The Gordon family adhered to <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> and the <a href="Forbes">Forbes</a> to <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>. Three universities were founded in the area prior to the 17th century, <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Aberdeen">King's College</a> in <a href="Old%20Aberdeen">Old Aberdeen</a> (1494), <a href="Marischal%20College">Marischal College</a> in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> (1593), and the <a href="University%20of%20Fraserburgh">University of Fraserburgh</a> (1597).

After the end of the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Revolution of 1688</a>, an extended peaceful period was interrupted only by such fleeting events such as the <a href="Rising%20of%201715">Rising of 1715</a> and the <a href="Rising%20of%201745">Rising of 1745</a>. The latter resulted in the end of the ascendancy of <a href="Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church">Episcopalianism</a> and the feudal power of landowners. An era began of increased agricultural and industrial progress. During the 17th century, Aberdeenshire was the location of more fighting, centered on the <a href="Marquess%20of%20Montrose">Marquess of Montrose</a> and the <a href="English%20Civil%20Wars">English Civil Wars</a>. This period also saw increased wealth due to the increase in trade with <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, and the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>.

The present council area is named after the historic <a href="Aberdeenshire%20%28historic%29">county of Aberdeen</a>, which had different boundaries and was abolished in 1975 under the <a href="Local%20Government%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201973">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973</a>. It was replaced by <a href="Grampian%20Region">Grampian Regional Council</a> and five district councils: <a href="Banff%20and%20Buchan">Banff and Buchan</a>, <a href="Gordon%2C%20Scotland">Gordon</a>, <a href="Kincardine%20and%20Deeside">Kincardine and Deeside</a>, <a href="Moray">Moray</a> and the <a href="City%20of%20Aberdeen">City of Aberdeen</a>. The current Aberdeenshire consists of all of former <a href="Aberdeenshire%20%28historic%29">Aberdeenshire</a>, former <a href="Kincardineshire">Kincardineshire</a> and the northeast portions of <a href="Banffshire">Banffshire</a>. Local government functions were shared between the two levels. In 1996, under the <a href="Local%20Government%20etc%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201994">Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994</a>, the Banff and Buchan district, Gordon district and Kincardine and Deeside district were merged to form the present Aberdeenshire council area, with the other two districts becoming autonomous council areas.

The population of the council area has risen over 50% since 1971 to approximately , representing 4.7% of Scotland's total. Aberdeenshire's population has increased by 9.1% since 2001, while Scotland's total population grew by 3.8%.

American Civil War

The American Civil War (commonly known as the "Civil War" in the United States) was fought in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> from 1861 to 1865. The result of a long-standing <a href="Origins%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">controversy</a> over <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>, war broke out in April 1861, when <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederates</a> attacked <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> in <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, shortly after <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">inaugurated</a>. The nationalists of the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> proclaimed loyalty to the U.S. Constitution. They faced <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Civil%20War%20era%20political%20and%20legal%20views%20on%20secession">secessionists</a> of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>, who advocated for states’ rights to perpetual slavery and its expansion in the Americas.

Among the 34 <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a>s in February 1861, seven <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> <a href="Slave%20states%20and%20free%20states">slave states</a> individually declared their <a href="secession">secession</a> from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy grew to include eleven states. The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States government</a>, nor was it recognized by any foreign country (although Britain and France granted it <a href="Belligerent">belligerent status</a>). The states that remained loyal, including the border states where slavery was legal, were known as the "Union" or the "North".

The North and South quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years. The Union finally won the war when General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> surrendered to General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">battle of Appomattox</a>, which triggered a series of <a href="Surrender%20%28military%29">surrender</a>s by Confederate generals throughout the southern states. Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dead, a higher number than the number of American military deaths in all other wars combined. Much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially the transportation systems. The Confederacy <a href="Conclusion%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War%23Capture%20of%20President%20Davis%20%28May%2010%29">collapsed</a>, slavery <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">was abolished</a>, and 4 million slaves were freed. The <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a> (1863–1877) overlapped and followed the war, with the process of restoring national unity, strengthening the national government, and granting <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> to freed slaves throughout the country. The Civil War is the most studied and <a href="Bibliography%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">written about</a> episode in <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States">American history</a>.

In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">1860 presidential election</a>, <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>, led by <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, supported banning slavery in all the <a href="Territories%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. territories</a>. The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights and as the first step in a grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a>' votes were distributed nationally and <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Unionist</a> <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>'s votes centered in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a <a href="Plurality%20%28voting%29">plurality</a> of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally, so Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">his inauguration</a>, seven slave states with <a href="cotton">cotton</a>-based economies declared secession and formed the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, a total of 49 percent. The first seven with state legislatures to resolve for secession included split majorities for unionists Douglas and Bell in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> with 51% and <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> with 55%. <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> had voted 46% for those unionists, <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> with 40%, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> with 38%, <a href="Texas">Texas</a> with 25%, and <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> cast <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> votes without a popular vote for president. Of these, only Texas held a referendum on secession.

Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Outgoing Democratic President <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%27s%20first%20inaugural%20address">Lincoln's March 4, 1861, inaugural address</a> declared that his administration would not initiate a <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a>. Speaking directly to the "Southern States", he attempted to calm their fears of any threats to slavery, reaffirming, "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so." After Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy, efforts at compromise failed and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an countries were so dependent on "<a href="King%20Cotton">King Cotton</a>" that they would intervene, but none did, and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.

Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">fired upon Fort Sumter</a>. While in the <a href="Western%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Western Theater</a> the Union made significant permanent gains, in the <a href="Eastern%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Eastern Theater</a>, the battle was inconclusive from 1861–1862. Lincoln issued the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, which made ending slavery a war goal. To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and seized <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. The 1863 Union <a href="Siege%20of%20Vicksburg">Siege of Vicksburg</a> split the Confederacy in two at the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. In 1863, <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s Confederate incursion north ended at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>. Western successes led to <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening <a href="Union%20blockade">naval blockade</a> of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the <a href="fall%20of%20Atlanta">fall of Atlanta</a> to <a href="William%20T.%20Sherman">William T. Sherman</a> and <a href="Sherman%27s%20march%20to%20the%20sea">his march to the sea</a>. The last significant battles raged around the <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>. Lee's escape attempt ended with his <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">surrender at Appomattox Court House</a>, on April 9, 1865. While the military war was coming to an end, the political reintegration of the nation was to take another 12 years, known as the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a>.

The American Civil War was one of the earliest true <a href="industrial%20warfare">industrial wars</a>. Railroads, the <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a>, steamships and <a href="Ironclad%20warship">iron-clad</a> ships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and subsequent conflicts. It remains the deadliest war in <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States">American history</a>. From 1861 to 1865, it is estimated that 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers died, along with an undetermined number of <a href="civilian%20casualties">civilians</a>. By one estimate, the war claimed the lives of 10 percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40.

The causes of secession were complex and have been controversial since the war began, but most academic scholars identify slavery as a central cause of the war. James C. Bradford wrote that the issue has been further complicated by <a href="historical%20revisionism">historical revisionists</a>, who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war. Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the <a href="1850s%20in%20the%20United%20States">1850s</a>. The <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a>, won the <a href="1860%20U.S.%20Presidential%20election">1860 election</a>. After Lincoln won many Southern leaders felt that disunion had become their only option, because they thought that they were losing representation, which would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies.

Slavery was a major cause of disunion. Although there were opposing views even in the Union States, most northern soldiers were largely indifferent on the subject of slavery, while Confederates fought the war, in large measure, to protect southern society, and slavery was an integral part of it. From the anti-slavery perspective, the issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republicanism</a>. The strategy of the anti-slavery forces was containment—to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction. The slave-holding interests in the South denounced this strategy as infringing upon their Constitutional rights. Southern whites believed that the emancipation of slaves would destroy the South's economy, due to the large amount of capital invested in slaves and fears of integrating the ex-slave black population.

Slavery was illegal in much of the North, having been outlawed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was also fading in the border states and in Southern cities, but it was expanding in the highly profitable cotton districts of the rural South and Southwest. Subsequent writers on the American Civil War looked to several factors explaining the geographic divide.

<a href="Sectionalism">Sectionalism</a> refers to the different economies, social structure, customs and political values of the North and South. It increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with <a href="subsistence%20farming">subsistence farming</a> for poor <a href="Freedman">freedmen</a>. In the 1840s and 50s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.

Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the <a href="economic%20determinism">economic determinism</a> of historian <a href="Charles%20A.%20Beard">Charles A. Beard</a> in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. While socially different, the sections economically benefited each other.

Historically, southern slave-holding states, because of their low cost manual labor, had little perceived need for mechanization, and supported having the right to sell cotton and purchase manufactured goods from any nation. Northern states, which had heavily invested in their still-nascent manufacturing, could not compete with the full-fledged industries of Europe in offering high prices for cotton imported from the South and low prices for manufactured exports in return. Thus, northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and protectionism while southern planters demanded free trade.

The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners, wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816. The Whigs and Republicans complained because they favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were only enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress. The tariff issue was and is sometimes cited–long after the war–by <a href="Lost%20Cause">Lost Cause</a> historians and <a href="neo-Confederate">neo-Confederate</a> apologists. In 1860–61 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession raised the tariff issue. Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the tariff, and when some did, for instance, <a href="Matthew%20Fontaine%20Maury">Matthew Fontaine Maury</a> and <a href="John%20Lothrop%20Motley">John Lothrop Motley</a>, they were generally writing for a foreign audience.

The South argued that each state had the right to secede—leave the Union—at any time, that the Constitution was a "compact" or agreement among the states. Northerners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a perpetual union. Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and other non-slavery explanations:

Between 1803 and 1854, the United States achieved a vast expansion of territory through purchase, negotiation, and conquest. At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. It was over territories west of the Mississippi that the proslavery and antislavery forces collided.

With the conquest of northern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> west to <a href="Alta%20California">California</a> in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well. 
Northern "free soil" interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a> over California balanced a free soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following California were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861). In the southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive. Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: "The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself."

By 1860, four doctrines had emerged to answer the question of federal control in the territories, and they all claimed they were sanctioned by the Constitution, implicitly or explicitly. The first of these "conservative" theories, represented by the <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Union Party</a>, argued that the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> apportionment of territory north for free soil and south for slavery should become a Constitutional mandate. The <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a> of 1860 was an expression of this view.

The second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, insisted that the Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balance—that slavery could be excluded in a territory as it was done in the <a href="Northwest%20Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a> of 1787 at the discretion of Congress, thus Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it. The <a href="Wilmot%20Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a> announced this position in 1846.

Senator <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> proclaimed the doctrine of territorial or "popular" sovereignty—which asserted that the settlers in a territory had the same rights as states in the Union to establish or disestablish slavery as a purely local matter. The <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a> of 1854 legislated this doctrine. In Kansas Territory, years of <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">pro and anti-slavery violence</a> and political conflict erupted; the congressional House of Representatives voted to admit Kansas as a free state in early 1860, but its admission in the Senate was delayed until January 1861, after the 1860 elections when southern senators began to leave.

The fourth theory was advocated by Mississippi Senator <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, one of state sovereignty ("states' rights"), also known as the "Calhoun doctrine", named after the South Carolinian political theorist and statesman <a href="John%20Caldwell%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>. Rejecting the arguments for federal authority or self-government, state sovereignty would empower states to promote the expansion of slavery as part of the Federal Union under the U.S. Constitution. "States' rights" was an ideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests through federal authority. As historian Thomas L. Krannawitter points out, the "Southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an unprecedented expansion of federal power." These four doctrines comprised the major ideologies presented to the American public on the matters of slavery, the territories and the U.S. Constitution prior to the 1860 presidential election.

Beginning in the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> and accelerating after the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, the people of the United States grew in the sense that their country was a national republic based on the belief that all people had inalienable political liberty and personal rights which could serve as an important example to the rest of the world. Previous regional independence movements such as the <a href="Greek%20War%20of%20Independence">Greek revolt</a> in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, the division and redivision of the Latin American political map, and the British-French <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean triumph</a> leading to an interest in redrawing Europe along cultural differences, all conspired to make for a time of upheaval and uncertainty about the basis of the nation-state.

In the world of 19th century self-made Americans, growing in prosperity, population and expanding westward, "freedom" could mean personal liberty or property rights. The unresolved difference would cause failure—first in their political institutions, then in their civil life together.

Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous spokesmen such as <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>. While practically all Northerners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States (called "unionists") and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the Confederacy. <a href="C.%20Vann%20Woodward">C. Vann Woodward</a> said of the latter group,

Perceived insults to Southern collective honor included the enormous popularity of "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>" (1852) and the actions of abolitionist <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a> in trying to incite a <a href="John%20Brown%27s%20raid%20on%20Harpers%20Ferry">slave rebellion</a> in 1859.

While the South moved towards a Southern nationalism, leaders in the North were also becoming more nationally minded, and they rejected any notion of splitting the Union. The Republican national electoral platform of 1860 warned that Republicans regarded disunion as <a href="treason">treason</a> and would not tolerate it: "We denounce those threats of disunion ... as denying the vital principles of a free government, and as an avowal of contemplated treason, which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence." The South ignored the warnings: Southerners did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together.

The election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession. Efforts at compromise, including the "<a href="Corwin%20Amendment">Corwin Amendment</a>" and the "<a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a>", failed.
Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy. 

According to Lincoln, the people of the United States had shown that they can be successful in "establishing" and "administering" a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, "maintaining" the republic, based on the people's vote. The people must now show: ". . . successful maintenance [of the Republic] against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It is now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided, there can be no successful appeal back to bullets; that there can be no successful appeal, except to ballots themselves, at succeeding elections. Such will be a great lesson of peace; teaching men that what they cannot take by an election, neither can they take it by a war . . .." 

The election of Lincoln caused the legislature of South Carolina to call a state convention to consider secession. Prior to the war, South Carolina did more than any other Southern state to advance the notion that a state had the right to <a href="Nullification%20%28U.S.%20Constitution%29">nullify</a> federal laws and, even, secede from the United States. The convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted the "<a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Immediate%20Causes%20Which%20Induce%20and%20Justify%20the%20Secession%20of%20South%20Carolina%20from%20the%20Federal%20Union">Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union</a>". It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Law%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. The "cotton states" of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit, seceding in January and February 1861.

Among the ordinances of secession passed by the individual states, those of three—Texas, Alabama, and Virginia—specifically mentioned the plight of the 'slaveholding states' at the hands of northern abolitionists. The rest make no mention of the slavery issue, and are often brief announcements of the dissolution of ties by the legislatures. However, at least four states—South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas also passed lengthy and detailed explanations of their causes for secession, all of which laid the blame squarely on the movement to abolish slavery and that movement's influence over the politics of the northern states. The southern states believed slaveholding was a constitutional right because of the <a href="Fugitive%20slave%20clause">Fugitive slave clause</a> of the Constitution.

These states agreed to form a new federal government, the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>, on February 4, 1861. They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the <a href="Dred%20Scott%20decision">Dred Scott decision</a> was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union "... was intended to be perpetual," but that, "The power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union," was not among the "... enumerated powers granted to Congress." One quarter of the U.S. Army—the entire garrison in Texas—was surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, <a href="David%20E.%20Twiggs">David E. Twiggs</a>, who then joined the Confederacy.

As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the <a href="Morrill%20Tariff">Morrill Tariff</a>, land grant colleges (the <a href="Morrill%20Land-Grant%20Colleges%20Act">Morrill Act</a>), a <a href="Homestead%20Act">Homestead Act</a>, a transcontinental railroad (the <a href="Pacific%20Railway%20Acts">Pacific Railway Acts</a>), the <a href="National%20Banking%20Act">National Banking Act</a> and the authorization of <a href="United%20States%20Note">United States Note</a>s by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The <a href="Revenue%20Act%20of%201861">Revenue Act of 1861</a> introduced the <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> to help finance the war.

On December 18, 1860, the <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a> was proposed to re-establish the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> line by constitutionally banning slavery in territories to the north of the line while guaranteeing it to the south. The adoption of this compromise likely would have prevented the secession of every southern state apart from South Carolina, but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected it. It was then proposed to hold a national referendum on the compromise. The Republicans again rejected the idea, although a majority of both Northerners and Southerners would have voted in favor of it. A pre-war February <a href="Peace%20Conference%20of%201861">Peace Conference of 1861</a> met in Washington, proposing a solution similar to that of the Crittenden compromise, it was rejected by Congress. The Republicans proposed an <a href="Corwin%20amendment">alternative compromise</a> to not interfere with slavery where it existed but the South regarded it as insufficient. Nonetheless, the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in Virginia's First Secessionist Convention on April 4, 1861.

On March 4, 1861, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was sworn in as President. In his <a href="Inauguration">inaugural address</a>, he argued that the Constitution was a "<a href="Preamble%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">more perfect union</a>" than the earlier <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union</a>, that it was a binding contract, and called any secession "legally void". He had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but said that he would use force to maintain possession of Federal property. The government would make no move to recover post offices, and if resisted, mail delivery would end at state lines. Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. Marshals and Judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S. mints in Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. In Lincoln's inaugural address, he stated that it would be U.S. policy to only collect import duties at its ports; there could be no serious injury to the South to justify armed revolution during his administration. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union, famously calling on "the mystic chords of memory" binding the two regions.

The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. Secretary of State <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William Seward</a> who at that time saw himself as the real governor or "prime minister" behind the throne of the inexperienced Lincoln, engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed. President Lincoln was determined to hold all remaining Union-occupied forts in the Confederacy, <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a> in Virginia, in Florida, <a href="Fort%20Pickens">Fort Pickens</a>, <a href="Fort%20Jefferson%2C%20Florida">Fort Jefferson</a>, and <a href="Fort%20Zachary%20Taylor">Fort Taylor</a>, and in the cockpit of secession, Charleston, South Carolina's <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>.

Fort Sumter was located in the middle of the harbor of <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Charleston</a>, South Carolina, where the U.S. fort's garrison had withdrawn to avoid incidents with local militias in the streets of the city. Unlike Buchanan, who allowed commanders to relinquish possession to avoid bloodshed, Lincoln required Maj. Anderson to hold on until fired upon. Jefferson Davis ordered the surrender of the fort. Anderson gave a conditional reply that the Confederate government rejected, and Davis ordered <a href="P.%20G.%20T.%20Beauregard">P. G. T. Beauregard</a> to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive. Troops under Beauregard bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12–13, forcing its capitulation.

The attack on Fort Sumter rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism. Historian <a href="Allan%20Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> said:

However, much of the North's attitude was based on the false belief that only a minority of Southerners were actually in favor of secession and that there were large numbers of southern Unionists that could be counted on. Had Northerners realized that most Southerners really did favor secession, they might have hesitated at attempting the enormous task of conquering a united South.

Lincoln called on all the states to send forces to recapture the fort and other federal properties. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for only <a href="75%2C000%20volunteers">75,000 volunteers</a> for 90 days. The governor of Massachusetts had state regiments on trains headed south the next day. In western Missouri, local secessionists seized <a href="Liberty%20Arsenal">Liberty Arsenal</a>. On May 3, 1861, Lincoln called for an additional 42,000 volunteers for a period of three years.

Four states in the middle and upper South had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, but now <a href="Virginia%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Virginia</a>, <a href="Tennessee%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Tennessee</a>, <a href="Arkansas%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Arkansas</a>, and <a href="North%20Carolina%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">North Carolina</a> refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>. 

<a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, and <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> were slave states that were opposed to both secession and coercing the South. <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> then joined them as an additional border state after it separated from <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and became a state of the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> in 1863.

Maryland's territory surrounded the United States' capital of <a href="Washington%20DC%20in%20the%20Civil%20War">Washington, DC</a> and could cut it off from the North. It had numerous anti-Lincoln officials who tolerated anti-army <a href="Baltimore%20riot%20of%201861">rioting in Baltimore</a> and the burning of bridges, both aimed at hindering the passage of troops to the South. Maryland's legislature voted overwhelmingly (53–13) to stay in the Union, but also rejected hostilities with its southern neighbors, voting to close Maryland's rail lines to prevent them from being used for war. Lincoln responded by establishing <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>, and unilaterally suspending <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>, in Maryland, along with sending in militia units from the North. Lincoln rapidly took control of Maryland and the District of Columbia, by seizing many prominent figures, including arresting 1/3 of the members of the <a href="Maryland%20General%20Assembly">Maryland General Assembly</a> on the day it reconvened. All were held without trial, ignoring a ruling by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="Roger%20Taney">Roger Taney</a>, a Maryland native, that only Congress (and not the president) could suspend habeas corpus (<a href="Ex%20parte%20Merryman">Ex parte Merryman</a>). Indeed, federal troops imprisoned a prominent Baltimore newspaper editor, <a href="Frank%20Key%20Howard">Frank Key Howard</a>, Francis Scott Key's grandson, after he criticized Lincoln in an editorial for ignoring the Supreme Court Chief Justice's ruling.

In Missouri, an <a href="Missouri%20Constitutional%20Convention%20%281861%E2%80%9363%29">elected convention</a> on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor <a href="Claiborne%20Fox%20Jackson">Claiborne F. Jackson</a> called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General <a href="Nathaniel%20Lyon">Nathaniel Lyon</a>, who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. ("See also: <a href="Missouri%20secession">Missouri secession</a>"). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri.

Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky.

After Virginia's secession, a <a href="Restored%20Government%20of%20Virginia">Unionist government</a> in <a href="Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wheeling</a> asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24, 1861. A voter turnout of 34 percent approved the statehood bill (96 percent approving). The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war engaged about 40,000 Federal troops for much of the war. Congress admitted <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> to the Union on June 20, 1863. West Virginia provided about 20,000–22,000 soldiers to both the Confederacy and the Union.

A Unionist secession attempt occurred in <a href="East%20Tennessee">East Tennessee</a>, but was suppressed by the Confederacy, which arrested over 3,000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union. They were held without trial.

The Civil War was a contest marked by the ferocity and frequency of battle. Over four years, 237 named battles were fought, as were many more minor actions and skirmishes, which were often characterized by their bitter intensity and high casualties. In his book "The American Civil War", John Keegan writes that "The American Civil War was to prove one of the most ferocious wars ever fought". Without geographic objectives, the only target for each side was the enemy's soldier.

As the first seven states began organizing a Confederacy in Montgomery, the entire U.S. army numbered 16,000. However, Northern governors had begun to mobilize their militias. The Confederate Congress authorized the new nation up to 100,000 troops sent by governors as early as February. By May, Jefferson Davis was pushing for 100,000 men under arms for one year or the duration, and that was answered in kind by the U.S. Congress.

In the first year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded, reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough. Both sides used a draft law—<a href="conscription">conscription</a>—as a device to encourage or force volunteering; relatively few were actually drafted and served. The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35; overseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt. The U.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. European <a href="History%20of%20Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States%23Immigration%201790%20to%201849">immigrants</a> joined the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland.
When the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically recruited by the states, and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863. Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great <a href="New%20York%20Draft%20Riots">draft riot in New York City in July 1863</a> involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the vote of the <a href="Tammany%20Hall">city's Democratic political machine</a>, not realizing it made them liable for the draft. Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.

In both the North and South, the draft laws were highly unpopular. In the North, some 120,000 men evaded conscription, many of them fleeing to Canada, and another 280,000 soldiers deserted during the war. At least 100,000 Southerners deserted, or about 10 percent. In the South, many men deserted temporarily to take care of their distressed families, then returned to their units. In the North, "bounty jumpers" enlisted to get the generous bonus, deserted, then went back to a second recruiting station under a different name to sign up again for a second bonus; 141 were caught and executed.
From a tiny frontier force in 1860, the Union and Confederate armies had grown into the "largest and most efficient armies in the world" within a few years. European observers at the time dismissed them as amateur and unprofessional, but British historian <a href="John%20Keegan">John Keegan</a>'s assessment is that each outmatched the French, Prussian and Russian armies of the time, and but for the Atlantic, would have threatened any of them with defeat.

Perman and Taylor (2010) say that historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:

At the start of the civil war, a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform any military duties. The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. After that, about 56,000 of the 409,000 POWs died in prisons during the war, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the conflict's fatalities.

The small <a href="Union%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> of 1861 was rapidly enlarged to 6,000 officers and 45,000 men in 1865, with 671 vessels, having a tonnage of 510,396. Its mission was to blockade Confederate ports, take control of the river system, defend against Confederate raiders on the high seas, and be ready for a possible war with the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Meanwhile, the main riverine war was fought in the West, where a series of major rivers gave access to the Confederate heartland, if the U.S. Navy could take control. In the East, the Navy supplied and moved army forces about, and occasionally shelled Confederate installations.

By early 1861, General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> had devised the <a href="Anaconda%20Plan">Anaconda Plan</a> to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. Scott argued that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy. Lincoln adopted parts of the plan, but he overruled Scott's caution about 90-day volunteers. Public opinion, however, demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture Richmond.

In April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended. The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. "King Cotton" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.

The Civil War occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution and subsequently many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad warship</a>. It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match the Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries. Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with ram bows, creating "ram fever" among Union squadrons wherever they threatened. But in the face of overwhelming Union superiority and the Union's own ironclad warships, they were unsuccessful.

The Confederacy experimented with a <a href="CSS%20Hunley">submarine</a>, which did not work well, and with building an ironclad ship, the <a href="CSS%20Virginia">CSS "Virginia"</a>, which was based on rebuilding a sunken Union ship, the <a href="USS%20Merrimack%20%281855%29">"Merrimack"</a>. On its first foray on March 8, 1862, the "Virginia" inflicted significant damage to the Union's wooden fleet, but the next day the first Union ironclad, the <a href="USS%20Monitor">USS "Monitor"</a>, arrived to challenge it in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>. The resulting three hour <a href="Battle%20of%20Hampton%20Roads">battle between the Ironclads</a> was a draw, but it marked the worldwide transition to ironclad warships. Not long after the battle the Confederacy was forced to scuttle the "Virginia" to prevent its capture, while the Union built many copies of the "Monitor". Lacking the technology and infrastructure to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain.

British investors built small, fast, steam-driven <a href="Blockade%20runners%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">blockade runners</a> that traded arms and luxuries brought in from Britain through Bermuda, Cuba, and the Bahamas in return for high-priced cotton. Many of the ships were designed for speed and were so small that only a small amount of cotton went out. When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner, the ship and cargo were condemned as a <a href="Prize%20of%20war">Prize of war</a> and sold, with the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British and they were simply released. The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war. There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies. Most historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy, however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.

Surdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well. The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it. Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade; they simply stopped calling at Confederate ports.

To fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested. After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15 million in 1871.

The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:


<a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses Grant</a> used river transport and <a href="Andrew%20H.%20Foote">Andrew Foote's</a> gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's "Gibraltar of the West" at Columbus, Kentucky. Though rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky in March 1862.

In addition to ocean-going warships coming up the Mississippi, the Union Navy used timberclads, tinclads, and armored gunboats. Shipyards at Cairo, Illinois, and St. Louis built new boats or modified steamboats for action. They took control of the Red, Tennessee, Cumberland, Mississippi, and Ohio rivers after victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry">Fort Henry</a> (February 6, 1862) and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> (February 11 to 16, 1862), and supplied Grant's forces as he moved into Tennessee. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Shiloh</a> (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell. Overnight, the Navy landed additional reinforcements, and Grant counter-attacked. Grant and the Union won a decisive victory—the first battle with the high casualty rates that would repeat over and over. <a href="Battle%20of%20Memphis">Memphis fell to Union forces</a> on June 6, 1862, and became a key base for further advances south along the Mississippi River. On April 24, 1862, U.S. Naval forces under <a href="David%20Farragut">Farragut</a> ran past Confederate defenses south of New Orleans. Confederate forces abandoned the city, giving the Union a critical anchor in the deep South.

Naval forces assisted Grant in the long, complex <a href="Vicksburg%20Campaign">Vicksburg Campaign</a> that resulted in the Confederates surrendering at <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a> in July 1863, and in the Union fully controlling the Mississippi River soon after.

In one of the first highly visible battles, a march by Union troops under the command of <a href="Major%20General">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="Irvin%20McDowell">Irvin McDowell</a> on the Confederate forces near Washington was repulsed.

Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> took command of the Union <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry%20Halleck">Henry W. Halleck</a>), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the <a href="Virginia%20Peninsula">peninsula</a> between the <a href="York%20River%20%28Virginia%29">York River</a> and <a href="James%20River">James River</a>, southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>, <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Johnston</a> halted his advance at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Seven%20Pines">Battle of Seven Pines</a>, then General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> and top subordinates <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a> and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the <a href="Seven%20Days%20Battles">Seven Days Battles</a> and forced his retreat. The <a href="Northern%20Virginia%20Campaign">Northern Virginia Campaign</a>, which included the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>, ended in yet another victory for the South. McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">John Pope's</a> Union <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a>, which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North. General Lee led 45,000 men of the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> across the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> near <a href="Sharpsburg%2C%20Maryland">Sharpsburg</a>, Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history. Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>.

When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a>. Burnside was soon defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a> on December 13, 1862, when more than 12,000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>.

Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a> in May 1863. Gen. Stonewall Jackson was shot in the arm by accidental friendly fire during the battle and subsequently died of complications. Gen. Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20Meade">George Meade</a> during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> (July 1 to 3, 1863). This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's <a href="Turning%20point%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">turning point</a>. <a href="Pickett%27s%20Charge">Pickett's Charge</a> on July 3 is often considered the <a href="high-water%20mark%20of%20the%20Confederacy">high-water mark of the Confederacy</a> because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000). However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>.

While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pea%20Ridge">Battle of Pea Ridge</a>. <a href="Leonidas%20Polk">Leonidas Polk</a>'s invasion of <a href="Columbus%2C%20Kentucky">Columbus</a>, Kentucky ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy. <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a> and central <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.

The <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of <a href="Battle%20of%20Island%20Number%20Ten">Island No. 10</a> and <a href="New%20Madrid%2C%20Missouri">New Madrid</a>, Missouri, and then <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. In April 1862, the <a href="Union%20Navy">Union Navy</a> captured New Orleans, which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg</a>, Mississippi, prevented Union control of the entire river.

General <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a>'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen. <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Perryville">Battle of Perryville</a>, although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. <a href="William%20Rosecrans">William Rosecrans</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stones%20River">Battle of Stones River</a> in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>.

The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a>. Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen. <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a>'s corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20Henry%20Thomas">George Henry Thomas</a>. Rosecrans retreated to <a href="Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee">Chattanooga</a>, which Bragg then besieged.

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, who won victories at Forts <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry">Henry</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Donelson">Donelson</a> (by which the Union seized control of the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee</a> and <a href="Cumberland%20River">Cumberland</a> Rivers); the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>; and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Vicksburg">Battle of Vicksburg</a>, which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the <a href="Turning%20point%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">turning points</a> of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the <a href="Chattanooga%20Campaign">Third Battle of Chattanooga</a>, driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.

Extensive <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> characterized the trans-Mississippi region, as the Confederacy lacked the troops and the logistics to support regular armies that could challenge Union control. Roving Confederate bands such as <a href="Quantrill%27s%20Raiders">Quantrill's Raiders</a> terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. The "Sons of Liberty" and "Order of the American Knights" attacked pro-Union people, elected officeholders, and unarmed uniformed soldiers. These partisans could not be entirely driven out of the state of Missouri until an entire regular Union infantry division was engaged.

By 1864, these violent activities harmed the nationwide anti-war movement organizing against the re-election of Lincoln. Missouri not only stayed in the Union, Lincoln took 70 percent of the vote for re-election.

Numerous small-scale military actions south and west of Missouri sought to control <a href="Indian%20Territory%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Indian Territory</a> and <a href="New%20Mexico%20Territory%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">New Mexico Territory</a> for the Union. The Union repulsed Confederate incursions into New Mexico in 1862, and the exiled Arizona government withdrew into Texas. In the Indian Territory, civil war broke out within tribes. About 12,000 Indian warriors fought for the Confederacy, and smaller numbers for the Union. The most prominent Cherokee was Brigadier General <a href="Stand%20Watie">Stand Watie</a>, the last Confederate general to surrender.

After the fall of <a href="Siege%20of%20Vicksburg">Vicksburg</a> in July 1863, General <a href="Edmund%20Kirby%20Smith">Kirby Smith</a> in Texas was informed by Jefferson Davis that he could expect no further help from east of the Mississippi River. Although he lacked resources to beat Union armies, he built up a formidable arsenal at Tyler, along with his own Kirby Smithdom economy, a virtual "independent fiefdom" in Texas, including railroad construction and international smuggling. The Union in turn did not directly engage him. Its 1864 <a href="Red%20River%20Campaign">Red River Campaign</a> to take Shreveport, Louisiana was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war.

At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of <a href="total%20war">total war</a> and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war. This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said "would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion. This policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening the end." Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions. Generals <a href="George%20Meade">George Meade</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Butler</a> were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond, General <a href="Franz%20Sigel">Franz Sigel</a> (and later <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>) were to <a href="Valley%20Campaigns%20of%201864">attack the Shenandoah Valley</a>, General Sherman was to capture Atlanta and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean), Generals <a href="George%20Crook">George Crook</a> and <a href="William%20W.%20Averell">William W. Averell</a> were to operate against railroad supply lines in <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, and Maj. Gen. <a href="Nathaniel%20Prentice%20Banks">Nathaniel P. Banks</a> was to capture <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a>, Alabama.

Grant's army set out on the <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a> with the goal of drawing Lee into a defense of Richmond, where they would attempt to pin down and destroy the Confederate army. The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wilderness">Wilderness</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Spotsylvania%20Court%20House">Spotsylvania</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Cold%20Harbor">Cold Harbor</a>. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the <a href="Bermuda%20Hundred%20Campaign">Bermuda Hundred</a> river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the <a href="James%20River">James River</a> and began the protracted <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>, where the two armies engaged in <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> for over nine months.

Grant finally found a commander, General <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, aggressive enough to prevail in the <a href="Valley%20Campaigns%20of%201864">Valley Campaigns of 1864</a>. Sheridan was initially repelled at the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Market">Battle of New Market</a> by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a>. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal A. Early</a> in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cedar%20Creek">Battle of Cedar Creek</a>. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>, a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.

Meanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> and <a href="John%20Bell%20Hood">John Bell Hood</a> along the way. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Atlanta">fall of Atlanta</a> on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president. Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the <a href="Franklin-Nashville%20Campaign">Franklin-Nashville Campaign</a>. Union Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20Schofield">John Schofield</a> defeated Hood at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Franklin%20%281864%29">Battle of Franklin</a>, and <a href="George%20Henry%20Thomas">George H. Thomas</a> dealt Hood a massive defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nashville">Battle of Nashville</a>, effectively destroying Hood's army.

Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20 percent of the farms in Georgia in his "<a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">March to the Sea</a>". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a>, Georgia in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, increasing the pressure on Lee's army.

Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Five%20Forks">Battle of Five Forks</a> (sometimes called "the <a href="Waterloo%20in%20popular%20culture%23Other">Waterloo</a> of the Confederacy") on April 1. This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the <a href="XXV%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">Union XXV Corps</a>, composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west after a defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sayler%27s%20Creek">Sayler's Creek</a>.

Initially, Lee did not intend to surrender, but planned to regroup at the <a href="Appomattox%20Court%20House%20National%20Historical%20Park">village of Appomattox Court House</a>, where supplies were to be waiting, and then continue the war. Grant chased Lee and got in front of him, so that when Lee's army reached Appomattox Court House, they were surrounded. After an initial battle, Lee decided that the fight was now hopeless, and surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the <a href="McLean%20House%20%28Appomattox%2C%20Virginia%29">McLean House</a>. In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring Confederate states to the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse, <a href="Traveller%20%28horse%29">Traveller</a>.

On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20assassination">shot</a> by <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a>, a Southern sympathizer. Lincoln died early the next morning, and <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> became the president. Meanwhile, Confederate forces across the South surrendered as news of Lee's surrender reached them. On April 26, 1865, General <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> surrendered nearly 90,000 men of the <a href="Army%20of%20Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a> to Major General <a href="William%20T.%20Sherman">William T. Sherman</a> at the <a href="Bennett%20Place">Bennett Place</a> near present-day Durham, North Carolina. It proved to be the largest surrender of Confederate forces, effectively bringing the war to an end. President Johnson officially declared a virtual end to the insurrection on May 9, 1865; President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> was captured the following day. On June 2, Kirby Smith officially surrendered his troops in the Trans-Mississippi Department. On June 23, Cherokee leader <a href="Stand%20Watie">Stand Watie</a> became the last Confederate General to surrender his forces.

Though the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators. The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a> worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.

<a href="Cotton%20diplomacy">Cotton diplomacy</a> proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860–62 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that "King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half. When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.

Lincoln's foreign policy was deficient in 1861 in terms of appealing to European public opinion. Diplomats had to explain that United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, but instead they repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate spokesmen, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. In addition, the European aristocracy (the dominant factor in every major country) was "absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic."

U.S. <a href="ambassador">minister</a> to Britain <a href="Charles%20Francis%20Adams%2C%20Sr.">Charles Francis Adams</a> proved particularly adept and convinced Britain not to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in Britain (<a href="CSS%20Alabama">CSS "Alabama"</a>, <a href="CSS%20Shenandoah">CSS "Shenandoah"</a>, <a href="CSS%20Tennessee%20%281863%29">CSS "Tennessee"</a>, <a href="CSS%20Tallahassee">CSS "Tallahassee"</a>, <a href="CSS%20Florida">CSS "Florida"</a>, and some others). The most famous, the <a href="CSS%20Alabama">CSS "Alabama"</a>, did considerable damage and led to serious <a href="Alabama%20Claims">postwar disputes</a>. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.

War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the <a href="Trent%20Affair">"Trent" affair</a>, involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship <a href="RMS%20Trent">"Trent"</a> and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South– though even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S. British Prime Minister <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> reportedly read "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>" three times when deciding on this.

The Union victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> caused them to delay this decision. The <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own <a href="French%20intervention%20in%20Mexico">seizure of Mexico</a> ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the <a href="January%20Uprising">Polish revolt against Russia</a> further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.

The <a href="Origins%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">causes of the war</a>, the reasons for its outcome, and even <a href="Naming%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">the name of the war itself</a> are subjects of lingering contention today. The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.

Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including <a href="James%20M.%20McPherson">James McPherson</a>, argue that Confederate victory was at least possible. McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.

Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win. Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could only continue to fight the war as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the <a href="Copperheads%20%28politics%29">Copperheads</a> and their peace platform.

Many scholars argue that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Civil War historian <a href="Shelby%20Foote">Shelby Foote</a> expressed this view succinctly: "I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back ... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War."

A minority view among historians is that the Confederacy lost because, as <a href="E.%20Merton%20Coulter">E. Merton Coulter</a> put it, "people did not will hard enough and long enough to win." Marxist historian Armstead Robinson agrees, pointing to a class conflict in the Confederates army between the slave owners and the larger number of non-owners. He argues that the non-owner soldiers grew embittered about fighting to preserve slavery, and fought less enthusiastically. He attributes the major Confederate defeats in 1863 at Vicksburg and Missionary Ridge to this class conflict. However, most historians reject the argument. <a href="James%20M.%20McPherson">James M. McPherson</a>, after reading thousands of letters written by Confederate soldiers, found strong patriotism that continued to the end; they truly believed they were fighting for freedom and liberty. Even as the Confederacy was visibly collapsing in 1864–65, he says most Confederate soldiers were fighting hard. Historian Gary Gallagher cites General Sherman who in early 1864 commented, "The devils seem to have a determination that cannot but be admired." Despite their loss of slaves and wealth, with starvation looming, Sherman continued, "yet I see no sign of let up—some few deserters—plenty tired of war, but the masses determined to fight it out."

Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers. The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.

Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history. The Union victory energized popular democratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant a new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following Doyle, argues that:

Scholars have debated what the effects of the war were on political and economic power in the South. The prevailing view is that the southern planter elite retained its powerful position in the South. However, a 2017 study challenges this, noting that while some Southern elites retained their economic status, the turmoil of the 1860s created greater opportunities for economic mobility in the South than in the North.

The war resulted in at least 1,030,000 casualties (3 percent of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deaths—two-thirds by disease, and 50,000 civilians. Binghamton University historian J. David Hacker believes the number of soldier deaths was approximately 750,000, 20 percent higher than traditionally estimated, and possibly as high as 850,000. The war accounted for more American deaths than in all other U.S. wars combined.

Based on 1860 census figures, 8 percent of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6 percent in the North and 18 percent in the South. About 56,000 soldiers <a href="American%20Civil%20War%20prison%20camps">died in prison camps</a> during the War. An estimated 60,000 men lost limbs in the war.

Union army dead, amounting to 15 percent of the over two million who served, was broken down as follows:

In addition there were 4,523 deaths in the Navy (2,112 in battle) and 460 in the Marines (148 in battle).

Black troops made up 10 percent of the Union death toll, they amounted to 15 percent of disease deaths but less than 3 percent of those killed in battle. Losses among <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s were high, in the last year and a half and from all reported casualties, approximately 20 percent of all African Americans enrolled in the military lost their lives during the Civil War. Notably, their mortality rate was significantly higher than white soldiers:

Confederate records compiled by historian William F. Fox list 74,524 killed and died of wounds and 59,292 died of disease. Including Confederate estimates of battle losses where no records exist would bring the Confederate death toll to 94,000 killed and died of wounds. Fox complained, however, that records were incomplete, especially during the last year of the war, and that battlefield reports likely under-counted deaths (many men counted as wounded in battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds). Thomas L. Livermore, using Fox's data, put the number of Confederate non-combat deaths at 166,000, using the official estimate of Union deaths from disease and accidents and a comparison of Union and Confederate enlistment records, for a total of 260,000 deaths. However, this excludes the 30,000 deaths of Confederate troops in prisons, which would raise the minimum number of deaths to 290,000.

The United States National Park Service uses the following figures in its official tally of war losses:

Union: 853,838

Confederate: 914,660

While the figures of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy remained commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. <a href="Francis%20Amasa%20Walker">Francis Amasa Walker</a>, Superintendent of the 1870 Census, used census and Surgeon General data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 Census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.

Analyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war. This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.

Deaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, exposure, or execution at the hands of the Confederates, and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1 million.

Losses were far higher than during the recent <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">defeat of Mexico</a>, which saw roughly thirteen thousand American deaths, including fewer than two thousand killed in battle, between 1846 and 1848. One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> at the turn of the century, such as <a href="charge%20%28warfare%29">charging</a>. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, <a href="Mini%C3%A9%20ball">Minié ball</a>s and (near the end of the war for the <a href="Union%20army">Union army</a>) repeating firearms such as the <a href="Spencer%20repeating%20rifle">Spencer Repeating Rifle</a> and the <a href="Henry%20rifle">Henry Repeating Rifle</a>, soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>, a style of fighting that defined much of World War I.

The wealth amassed in slaves and slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5 million blacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied before the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a>.

The war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South. All accumulated investment Confederate bonds was forfeit; most banks and railroads were bankrupt. Income per person in the South dropped to less than 40 percent of that of the North, a condition that lasted until well into the 20th century. Southern influence in the U.S. federal government, previously considerable, was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th century. The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as <a href="Reconstruction%20Era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>.

While not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery, most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Lee</a>'s army had close family ties to slavery. To Northerners, in contrast, the motivation was primarily to preserve the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a>, not to abolish slavery. Abraham Lincoln consistently made preserving the Union the central goal of the war, though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal. Lincoln's decision to issue the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> angered both <a href="Peace%20Democrats">Peace Democrats</a> ("Copperheads") and <a href="War%20Democrats">War Democrats</a>, but energized most Republicans. By warning that free blacks would flood the North, Democrats made gains in the <a href="1862%20congressional%20elections">1862 elections</a>, but they did not gain control of Congress. The Republicans' counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support, with the Democrats losing decisively in the 1863 elections in the northern state of Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment.

The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.

During the Civil War, sentiment concerning slaves, enslavement and emancipation in the United States was divided. In 1861, Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that "to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game." <a href="Copperheads%20%28politics%29">Copperheads</a> and some <a href="War%20Democrats">War Democrats</a> opposed emancipation, although the latter eventually accepted it as part of <a href="total%20war">total war</a> needed to save the Union.

At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a> and Generals <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> (in Missouri) and <a href="David%20Hunter">David Hunter</a> (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats. Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected. But only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, which was enacted by Congress. When Lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation, Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it, as to do otherwise would seem like "our last shriek on the retreat". Lincoln laid the groundwork for public support in an open letter published in abolitionist Horace Greeley's newspaper.

In September 1862, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> provided this opportunity, and the subsequent <a href="War%20Governors%27%20Conference">War Governors' Conference</a> added support for the proclamation. Lincoln issued his preliminary <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to <a href="Albert%20G.%20Hodges">Albert G. Hodges</a>, Lincoln explained his belief that "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."

Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in inducing border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves to fight for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) and Union-controlled regions around New Orleans, Norfolk and elsewhere, were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware.

Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty. The Emancipation Proclamation greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. By late 1864, Lincoln was playing a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a>, which made emancipation universal and permanent.

In "<a href="Texas%20v.%20White">Texas v. White</a>", the United States Supreme Court ruled that Texas had remained a state ever since it first joined the Union, despite claims that it joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States</a>; the court further held that the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States">Constitution</a> did not permit <a href="U.S.%20state">states</a> to unilaterally <a href="secession">secede</a> from the United States, and that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were "absolutely <a href="Void%20%28law%29">null</a>", under the constitution.

Reconstruction began during the war, with the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and it continued until 1877. It comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the outstanding issues of the war's aftermath, the most important of which were the three "<a href="Reconstruction%20Amendments">Reconstruction Amendments</a>" to the Constitution, which remain in effect to the present time: the 13th (1865), the 14th (1868) and the 15th (1870). From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to consolidate the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a "<a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republican form of government</a> for the ex-Confederate states; and to permanently end slavery—and prevent semi-slavery status.

President Johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865, when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> demanded proof that Confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free. They came to the fore after the 1866 elections and undid much of Johnson's work. In 1872 the <a href="Liberal%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">"Liberal Republicans"</a> argued that the war goals had been achieved and that Reconstruction should end. They ran a presidential ticket in 1872 but were decisively defeated. In 1874, Democrats, primarily Southern, took control of Congress and opposed any more reconstruction. The <a href="Compromise%20of%201877">Compromise of 1877</a> closed with a national consensus that the Civil War had finally ended. With the withdrawal of federal troops, however, whites retook control of every Southern legislature; the <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a> period of disenfranchisement and legal segregation was about to begin.

The Civil War is one of the central events in American collective memory. There are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections. The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war. The last theme includes moral evaluations of <a href="racism">racism</a> and slavery, heroism in combat and heroism behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an "<a href="Empire%20of%20Liberty">Empire of Liberty</a>" influencing the world.

Professional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the war, than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside academe, leading to a proliferation of solid studies by non-scholars who are thoroughly familiar with the primary sources, pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and write for the large public readership, rather than the small scholarly community. <a href="Bruce%20Catton">Bruce Catton</a> and <a href="Shelby%20Foote">Shelby Foote</a> are among the best-known writers. Practically every major figure in the war, both North and South, has had a serious biographical study.
Deeply religious Southerners saw the hand of God in history, which demonstrated His wrath at their sinfulness, or His rewards for their suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black <a href="Baptists">Baptist</a> preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:

In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:

Memory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the <a href="Lost%20Cause%20of%20the%20Confederacy">"Lost Cause"</a>, shaping regional identity and race relations for generations. Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly "a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful. Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the "virulent racism" of the 19th century, sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause "a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter" in every instance.

The interpretation of the Civil War presented by <a href="Charles%20A.%20Beard">Charles A. Beard</a> and Mary R. Beard in "The Rise of American Civilization" (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:

The Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers.

The American Civil War has been commemorated in many capacities ranging from the reenactment of battles, to statues and memorial halls erected, to films being produced, to stamps and coins with Civil War themes being issued, all of which helped to shape public memory. This varied advent occurred in greater proportions on the 100th and 150th anniversary.

<a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>'s take on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory, as seen in such film classics as "<a href="Birth%20of%20a%20Nation">Birth of a Nation</a>" (1915), "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" (1939), and more recently "<a href="Lincoln%20%282012%20film%29">Lincoln</a>" (2012). <a href="Ken%20Burns">Ken Burns</a> produced a notable PBS series on television titled "<a href="The%20Civil%20War%20%28TV%20series%29">The Civil War</a>" (1990). It was digitally remastered and re-released in 2015.

There were numerous technological innovations during the Civil War that had a great impact on 19th century science. The Civil War was one of the earliest examples of an "<a href="Industrial%20warfare">industrial war</a>", in which technological might is used to achieve military supremacy in a war. New inventions, such as the <a href="Military%20railways">train</a> and <a href="Telegraphy">telegraph</a>, delivered soldiers, supplies and messages at a time when horses were considered to be the fastest way to travel. It was also in this war when countries first used aerial warfare, in the form of reconnaissance <a href="History%20of%20aerial%20warfare%23American%20Civil%20War">balloons</a>, to a significant effect. It saw the first action involving steam-powered <a href="ironclad%20warships">ironclad warships</a> in naval warfare history. <a href="Repeating%20rifle">Repeating firearms</a> such as the <a href="Henry%20rifle">Henry rifle</a>, <a href="Spencer%20rifle">Spencer rifle</a>, <a href="Colt%20revolving%20rifle">Colt revolving rifle</a>, <a href="Triplett%20%26amp%3B%20Scott%20carbine">Triplett & Scott carbine</a> and others, first appeared during the Civil War; they were a revolutionary invention that would soon replace muzzle-loading and single-shot firearms in warfare, as well as the first appearances of rapid-firing weapons and <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s such as the <a href="Agar%20gun">Agar gun</a> and the <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a>.

Andy Warhol (; born Andrew Warhola; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the <a href="Art%20movement">visual art movement</a> known as <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a>.

He promoted a collection of personalities known as <a href="Warhol%20superstars">Warhol superstars</a>, and is credited with coining the widely used expression "<a href="15%20minutes%20of%20fame">15 minutes of fame</a>." In the late 1960s, he managed and produced the <a href="experimental%20rock">experimental rock</a> band <a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground">The Velvet Underground</a> and founded "<a href="Interview%20%28magazine%29">Interview</a>" magazine. He authored numerous books, including "<a href="The%20Philosophy%20of%20Andy%20Warhol">The Philosophy of Andy Warhol</a>" and "". He is also notable as a <a href="gay">gay</a> man who lived openly as such before the <a href="gay%20liberation">gay liberation movement</a>. After a <a href="gallbladder">gallbladder</a> <a href="surgery">surgery</a> in 1987, Warhol died in February of that year at the age of 58.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective <a href="art%20exhibition">exhibitions</a>, books, and <a href="I%20Shot%20Andy%20Warhol">feature</a> and documentary films. <a href="The%20Andy%20Warhol%20Museum">The Andy Warhol Museum</a> in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105 million for a 1963 <a href="canvas">canvas</a> titled "<a href="Silver%20Car%20Crash%20%28Double%20Disaster%29">Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)</a>"; his works include some of the <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20paintings">most expensive paintings ever sold</a>. A 2009 article in "The Economist" described Warhol as the "<a href="bellwether">bellwether</a> of the art market".

Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942) and <a href="Julia%20Warhola">Julia</a> ("née" Zavacká, 1892–1972), whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S.

His parents were working-class <a href="Lemko">Lemko</a> emigrants from <a href="Mikov%C3%A1">Mikó</a> (now called Miková), located in today's northeastern <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, part of the former <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>. Warhol's father emigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the <a href="Oakland%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Oakland</a> neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The family was <a href="Ruthenian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church">Ruthenian Catholic</a> and attended <a href="St.%20John%20Chrysostom%20Byzantine%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Pittsburgh%29">St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church</a>. Andy Warhol had two older brothers—Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born before the family emigrated; <a href="John%20Warhola">Ján</a> was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, <a href="James%20Warhola">James Warhola</a>, became a successful children's book illustrator.

In third grade, Warhol had <a href="Sydenham%27s%20chorea">Sydenham's chorea</a> (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of <a href="Rheumatic%20fever">scarlet fever</a> which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness. He became a <a href="Hypochondriasis">hypochondriac</a>, developing a fear of hospitals and doctors. Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother. At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.

As a teenager, Warhol graduated from <a href="Schenley%20High%20School">Schenley High School</a> in 1945. Also as a teen, Warhol won a <a href="Scholastic%20Art%20and%20Writing%20Awards">Scholastic Art and Writing Award</a>. After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study <a href="Visual%20arts%20education">art education</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a> in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in Pittsburgh, where he studied <a href="commercial%20art">commercial art</a>. During his time there, Warhol joined the campus Modern Dance Club and Beaux Arts Society. He also served as art director of the student art magazine, "Cano", illustrating a cover in 1948 and a full-page interior illustration in 1949. These are believed to be his first two published artworks. Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949. Later that year, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising.

Warhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for "<a href="Glamour%20%28magazine%29">Glamour</a>" magazine in the late 1940s. In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a <a href="Footwear">designer</a> for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller. American photographer John Coplans recalled that
nobody drew shoes the way Andy did. He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, <a href="Toulouse-Lautrec">Toulouse-Lautrec</a> kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place. The kids in the apartment [which Andy shared in New York – note by Coplans] noticed that the <a href="Shoe%23Construction">vamp</a>s on Andy's shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but [Israel] Miller didn't mind. Miller loved them.

Warhol's "whimsical" <a href="Pen-and-ink%20drawing">ink drawing</a>s of shoe advertisements figured in some of his earliest showings at the <a href="Bodley%20Gallery">Bodley Gallery</a> in New York.

Warhol was an early adopter of the <a href="Screen%20printing">silk screen</a> printmaking process as a technique for making paintings. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his "blotted line" technique, applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a> process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas. In his book "", Warhol writes, "When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something."

With the rapid expansion of the <a href="record%20industry">record industry</a>, <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Records</a> hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.

He began exhibiting his work during the 1950s. He held exhibitions at the <a href="Hugo%20Gallery">Hugo Gallery</a> and the <a href="Bodley%20Gallery">Bodley Gallery</a> in New York City; in California, his first West Coast gallery exhibition was on July 9, 1962, in the <a href="Ferus%20Gallery">Ferus Gallery</a> of Los Angeles. The exhibition marked his <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> debut of pop art.
Andy Warhol's first New York solo <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a> exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's <a href="Stable%20Gallery">Stable Gallery</a> November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works "<a href="Marilyn%20Diptych">Marilyn Diptych</a>", "100 Soup Cans", "100 Coke Bottles", and "100 Dollar Bills". At the <a href="Stable%20Gallery">Stable Gallery</a> exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet <a href="John%20Giorno">John Giorno</a> who would star in Warhol's first film, "<a href="Sleep%20%28film%29">Sleep</a>", in 1963.

It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, <a href="mushroom%20cloud">mushroom cloud</a>s, <a href="electric%20chair">electric chair</a>s, <a href="Campbell%27s%20Soup%20Cans">Campbell's Soup Cans</a>, <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> bottles, celebrities such as <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, <a href="Troy%20Donahue">Troy Donahue</a>, <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>, and <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African-American protesters during the <a href="Birmingham%20campaign">Birmingham campaign</a> in the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. During these years, he founded his studio, "<a href="The%20Factory">The Factory</a>" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:

New York City's <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists such as Warhol were attacked for "capitulating" to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.

A pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit "The American Supermarket", a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) <a href="Billy%20Apple">Billy Apple</a>, Mary Inman, and <a href="Robert%20Watts%20%28artist%29">Robert Watts</a>. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.

As an <a href="Commercial%20art">advertisement illustrator</a> in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was <a href="Gerard%20Malanga">Gerard Malanga</a>. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at "<a href="The%20Factory">The Factory</a>", Warhol's <a href="aluminum%20foil">aluminum foil</a>-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included <a href="Freddie%20Herko">Freddie Herko</a>, <a href="Ondine%20%28actor%29">Ondine</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Tavel">Ronald Tavel</a>, <a href="Mary%20Woronov">Mary Woronov</a>, <a href="Billy%20Name">Billy Name</a>, and <a href="Brigid%20Berlin">Brigid Berlin</a> (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).

During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of <a href="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> and <a href="counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counterculture</a> eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation "<a href="Warhol%20Superstar">Superstars</a>", including <a href="Nico">Nico</a>, <a href="Joe%20Dallesandro">Joe Dallesandro</a>, <a href="Edie%20Sedgwick">Edie Sedgwick</a>, <a href="Viva%20%28actress%29">Viva</a>, <a href="Isabelle%20Collin%20Dufresne">Ultra Violet</a>, <a href="Holly%20Woodlawn">Holly Woodlawn</a>, <a href="Jackie%20Curtis">Jackie Curtis</a>, and <a href="Candy%20Darling">Candy Darling</a>. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer <a href="John%20Giorno">John Giorno</a> and film-maker <a href="Jack%20Smith%20%28film%20director%29">Jack Smith</a>, also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton, photographer Stephen Shore and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician <a href="Beck">Beck</a>).

On June 3, 1968, <a href="radical%20feminist">radical feminist</a> writer <a href="Valerie%20Solanas">Valerie Solanas</a> shot Warhol and <a href="Mario%20Amaya">Mario Amaya</a>, art critic and curator, at Warhol's studio. Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored in 1967 the "<a href="S.C.U.M.%20Manifesto">S.C.U.M. Manifesto</a>", a <a href="Separatist%20feminism">separatist feminist</a> tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the 1968 Warhol film "<a href="I%2C%20a%20Man">I, a Man</a>". Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.

Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and <a href="internal%20cardiac%20massage">massaged his heart</a> to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life, including being required to wear a surgical corset. The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.

Solanas was arrested the day after the assault, after turning herself in to police. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol "had too much control over my life." She was subsequently diagnosed with <a href="paranoid%20schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</a> and eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Correction">Department of Corrections</a>. After the shooting, the Factory scene heavily increased security, and for many the "Factory 60s" ended.

Warhol had this to say about the attack: "Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television."

Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more entrepreneurial. According to <a href="Bob%20Colacello">Bob Colacello</a>, Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran <a href="Mohammad%20Reza%20Pahlavi">Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</a>, his wife Empress <a href="Farah%20Pahlavi">Farah Pahlavi</a>, his sister <a href="Princess%20Ashraf%20Pahlavi">Princess Ashraf Pahlavi</a>, <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href="Liza%20Minnelli">Liza Minnelli</a>, <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="Diana%20Ross">Diana Ross</a>, <a href="Luigi%20Accame">Luigi Accame</a>, and <a href="Brigitte%20Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a>. Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> was created in 1973. He also founded, with <a href="Gerard%20Malanga">Gerard Malanga</a>, "<a href="Interview%20%28magazine%29">Interview</a>" magazine, and published "The Philosophy of Andy Warhol" (1975). An idea expressed in the book: "Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art."

Warhol socialized at various nightspots in New York City, including <a href="Max%27s%20Kansas%20City">Max's Kansas City</a>; and, later in the 1970s, <a href="Studio%2054">Studio 54</a>. He was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer. Art critic <a href="Robert%20Hughes%20%28critic%29">Robert Hughes</a> called him "the white mole of <a href="Union%20Square%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Union Square</a>."

With his longtime friend <a href="Stuart%20Pivar">Stuart Pivar</a>, Warhol founded the <a href="New%20York%20Academy%20of%20Art">New York Academy of Art</a> in 1979.

Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the "<a href="bull%20market">bull market</a>" of 1980s New York art: <a href="Jean-Michel%20Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>, <a href="Julian%20Schnabel">Julian Schnabel</a>, <a href="David%20Salle">David Salle</a> and other so-called <a href="Neo-expressionism">Neo-Expressionists</a>, as well as members of the <a href="Transavantgarde">Transavantgarde</a> movement in Europe, including <a href="Francesco%20Clemente">Francesco Clemente</a> and <a href="Enzo%20Cucchi">Enzo Cucchi</a>. Before the 1984 <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> <a href="Winter%20Olympics">Winter Olympics</a>, he teamed up with 15 other artists, including <a href="David%20Hockney">David Hockney</a> and <a href="Cy%20Twombly">Cy Twombly</a>, and contributed a <a href="Speed%20Skater">Speed Skater</a> print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed Skater was used for the official <a href="1984%20Winter%20Olympics">Sarajevo Winter Olympics</a> poster.

By this time, <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> artist <a href="Fab%20Five%20Freddy">Fab Five Freddy</a> paid homage to Warhol when he painted an entire train with Campbell soup cans. This was instrumental in Freddy becoming involved in the underground NYC art scene and becoming an affiliate of Basquiat.

By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a "business artist". In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the <a href="Jewish%20Museum%20%28Manhattan%29">Jewish Museum</a> in Manhattan, entitled "Jewish Geniuses", which Warhol—who was uninterested in <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> and Jews—had described in his diary as "They're going to sell." In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as "the most brilliant mirror of our times," contending that "Warhol had captured something irresistible about the <a href="zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> of American culture in the 1970s."

Warhol also had an appreciation for intense <a href="Hollywood%20glamour">Hollywood glamour</a>. He once said: "I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic."

Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32 a.m. on February 22, 1987. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery from <a href="gallbladder">gallbladder</a> surgery at <a href="New%20York%20Hospital">New York Hospital</a> before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative <a href="cardiac%20arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmia</a>. Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and <a href="water%20intoxication">water intoxication</a>. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.

Shortly before Warhol's death, doctors expected Warhol to survive the surgery, though a revaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought. It was widely reported at the time that Warhol died of a "routine" surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a <a href="Family%20history%20%28medicine%29">family history</a> of gallbladder problems, his previous <a href="Ballistic%20trauma">gunshot wounds</a>, and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.

Warhol's brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-coffin <a href="Wake%20%28ceremony%29">wake</a> was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the <a href="Holy%20Ghost%20Byzantine%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Pittsburgh%29">Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church</a> on Pittsburgh's <a href="North%20Shore%20%28Pittsburgh%29">North Side</a>. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. <a href="Yoko%20Ono">Yoko Ono</a> and <a href="John%20Richardson%20%28art%20historian%29">John Richardson</a> were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and <a href="Asparagus%20aethiopicus">asparagus ferns</a>. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to <a href="St.%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Byzantine%20Catholic%20Cemetery">St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery</a> in <a href="Bethel%20Park%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bethel Park</a>, a south suburb of Pittsburgh.

At the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, Paige Powell dropped a copy of "Interview" magazine, an "Interview" T-shirt, and a bottle of the <a href="Est%C3%A9e%20Lauder%20Companies">Estee Lauder</a> perfume "Beautiful" into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20New%20York">St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York</a>.

Warhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the "advancement of the visual arts". Warhol had so many possessions that it took <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20 million.

In 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission "to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process" and is "focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature."

The <a href="Artists%20Rights%20Society">Artists Rights Society</a> is the U.S. copyright representative for the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts for all Warhol works with the exception of Warhol film stills. The U.S. copyright representative for Warhol film stills is the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Additionally, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts has agreements in place for its image archive. All digital images of Warhol are exclusively managed by <a href="Branded%20Entertainment%20Network">Corbis</a>, while all transparency images of Warhol are managed by Art Resource.

The Andy Warhol Foundation released its "20th Anniversary Annual Report" as a three-volume set in 2007: Vol. I, 1987–2007; Vol. II, Grants & Exhibitions; and Vol. III, Legacy Program. The Foundation remains one of the largest grant-giving organizations for the visual arts in the U.S.

Many of Warhol's works and possessions are on display at <a href="The%20Andy%20Warhol%20Museum">The Andy Warhol Museum</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>. The foundation donated more than 3,000 works of art to the museum.

By the beginning of the 1960s, <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a> was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>, would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the "Pope of Pop", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from <a href="cartoons">cartoons</a> and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as <a href="Willem%20de%20Kooning">Willem de Kooning</a>). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries <a href="Jasper%20Johns">Jasper Johns</a>, <a href="James%20Rosenquist">James Rosenquist</a> and <a href="Robert%20Rauschenberg">Robert Rauschenberg</a> had also once graced.

It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, "Pop, The Genius of Warhol", was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter. For his first major exhibition, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. A 1964 "Large Campbell’s Soup Can" was sold in a 2007 <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> auction to a South American collector for £5.1 million ($7.4 million).

He loved <a href="celebrity">celebrities</a>, so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used <a href="silk-screen">silk-screen</a>ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.

In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then "elite supercar" <a href="BMW%20M1">BMW M1</a> for the fourth installment in the <a href="BMW%20Art%20Car%20Project">BMW Art Car Project</a>. It was reported at the time that, unlike the three artists before him, Warhol opted to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer his scale-model design to the car. It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.

Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 "Death and Disaster" series. The "Death and Disaster" paintings included "Red Car Crash", "Purple Jumping Man", and "Orange Disaster." One of these paintings, the diptych "Silver Car Crash", became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.

Some of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Keatonesque</a>. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work. He has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is "already there 'on the surface'."

His <a href="Rorschach%20test">Rorschach inkblots</a> are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow <a href="Motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motif</a>) and his <a href="redox">oxidation</a> paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works—and their <a href="means%20of%20production">means of production</a>—mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York "Factory". Biographer Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's "piss paintings":

Warhol's first portrait of "Basquiat" (1982) is a black photo-silkscreen over an oxidized copper "piss painting".

After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of more than 50 large collaborative works done with <a href="Jean-Michel%20Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> between 1984 and 1986. Despite negative criticism when these were first shown, Warhol called some of them "masterpieces," and they were influential for his later work.

Andy Warhol was commissioned in 1984 by collector and gallerist <a href="Alexander%20Iolas">Alexander Iolas</a> to produce work based on <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Supper%20%28Leonardo%29">The Last Supper</a>" for an exhibition at the old refectory of the Palazzo delle Stelline in <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, opposite from the <a href="Santa%20Maria%20delle%20Grazie%20%28Milan%29">Santa Maria delle Grazie</a> where Leonardo da Vinci's mural can be seen. Warhol exceeded the demands of the commission and produced nearly 100 variations on the theme, mostly silkscreens and paintings, and among them a collaborative sculpture with Basquiat, the "Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper)".
The Milan exhibition that opened in January 1987 with a set of 22 silk-screens, was the last exhibition for both the artist and the gallerist. The series of "The Last Supper" was seen by some as "arguably his greatest," but by others as "wishy-washy, religiose" and "spiritless." It is the largest series of religious-themed works by any U.S. artist.

Artist <a href="Maurizio%20Cattelan">Maurizio Cattelan</a> describes that it is difficult to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy Warhol: "That's probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless." Warhol was an inspiration towards Cattelan's magazine and photography compilations, such as "Permanent Food, Charley", and "Toilet Paper".

In the period just before his death, Warhol was working on "<a href="Cars%20%28painting%29">Cars</a>", a series of paintings for <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>.

A self-portrait by Andy Warhol (1963–64), which sold in New York at the May Post-War and Contemporary evening sale in <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a>, fetched $38.4 million.

On May 9, 2012, his classic painting "Double Elvis (Ferus Type)" sold at auction at <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> in New York for US$33 million. With commission, the sale price totaled US$37,042,500, short of the $50 million that Sotheby's had predicted the painting might bring. The piece (silkscreen ink and <a href="spray%20paint">spray paint</a> on canvas) shows <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> in a <a href="gunslinger">gunslinger</a> pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the <a href="Ferus%20Gallery">Ferus Gallery</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Warhol made 22 versions of the "Double Elvis", nine of which are held in museums.

In November 2013, his "<a href="Silver%20Car%20Crash%20%28Double%20Disaster%29">Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)</a>" diptych sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction for $105.4 million, a new record for the pop artist (pre-auction estimates were at $80 million). Created in 1963, this work had rarely been seen in public in the previous years. In November 2014, "<a href="Triple%20Elvis">Triple Elvis</a>" sold for $81.9m (£51.9m) at an auction in New York.

Warhol worked across a wide range of media—painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films, plus some 500 short black-and-white "<a href="Screen%20Tests">screen test</a>" portraits of Factory visitors. One of his most famous films, "<a href="Sleep%20%28film%29">Sleep</a>", monitors poet <a href="John%20Giorno">John Giorno</a> sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film "<a href="Blow%20Job%20%28film%29">Blow Job</a>" is one continuous shot of the face of <a href="DeVeren%20Bookwalter">DeVeren Bookwalter</a> supposedly receiving <a href="oral%20sex">oral sex</a> from filmmaker <a href="Willard%20Maas">Willard Maas</a>, although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, "<a href="Empire%20%281964%20film%29">Empire</a>" (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the <a href="Empire%20State%20Building">Empire State Building</a> in New York City at dusk. The film "<a href="Eat%20%28film%29">Eat</a>" consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by <a href="LaMonte%20Young">LaMonte Young</a> called "Trio for Strings" and subsequently created his famous series of static films including "Kiss", "Eat", and "Sleep" (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker <a href="Jonas%20Mekas">Jonas Mekas</a>, who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.

"<a href="Batman%20Dracula">Batman Dracula</a>" is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the "Batman" series, Warhol's movie was an "homage" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">campy</a> Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary "<a href="Jack%20Smith%20and%20the%20Destruction%20of%20Atlantis">Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis</a>".

Warhol's 1965 film "<a href="Vinyl%20%281965%20film%29">Vinyl</a>" is an adaptation of <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a>' popular <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n novel "<a href="A%20Clockwork%20Orange%20%28novel%29">A Clockwork Orange</a>". Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as <a href="Brigid%20Berlin">Brigid Berlin</a>, <a href="Viva%20%28actress%29">Viva</a>, <a href="Edie%20Sedgwick">Edie Sedgwick</a>, <a href="Candy%20Darling">Candy Darling</a>, <a href="Holly%20Woodlawn">Holly Woodlawn</a>, <a href="Ondine%20%28actor%29">Ondine</a>, <a href="Nico">Nico</a>, and <a href="Jackie%20Curtis">Jackie Curtis</a>. Legendary underground artist <a href="Jack%20Smith%20%28film%20director%29">Jack Smith</a> appears in the film "Camp".

His most popular and critically successful film was "<a href="Chelsea%20Girls">Chelsea Girls</a>" (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two <a href="16%20mm%20film">16 mm</a>-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that "story" while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.

Other important films include "<a href="Bike%20Boy">Bike Boy</a>", "My Hustler", "<a href="The%20Nude%20Restaurant">The Nude Restaurant</a>", and "<a href="Lonesome%20Cowboys%20%281968%20film%29">Lonesome Cowboys</a>", a raunchy pseudo-<a href="Western%20%28genre%29">western</a>. These and other titles document gay underground and camp culture, and continue to feature prominently in scholarship about sexuality and art. Warhol was a fan of filmmaker <a href="Radley%20Metzger">Radley Metzger</a> film work and commented that Metzger's film, "<a href="The%20Lickerish%20Quartet">The Lickerish Quartet</a>", was "an outrageously kinky masterpiece". "<a href="Blue%20Movie">Blue Movie</a>"—a film in which Warhol superstar <a href="Viva%20%28actress%29">Viva</a> makes love in bed with <a href="Louis%20Waldon">Louis Waldon</a>, another Warhol superstar—was Warhol's last film as director. The film, a seminal film in the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Porn">Golden Age of Porn</a>, was, at the time, controversial for its frank approach to a sexual encounter. "Blue Movie" was publicly screened in New York City in 2005, for the first time in more than 30 years.

After his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, <a href="Paul%20Morrissey">Paul Morrissey</a>, took over the film-making chores for <a href="the%20Factory">the Factory</a> collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie <a href="exploitation%20film">exploitation</a> fare with "<a href="Flesh%20%281968%20film%29">Flesh</a>", "<a href="Trash%20%281970%20film%29">Trash</a>", and "<a href="Heat%20%281972%20film%29">Heat</a>". All of these films, including the later "<a href="Blood%20for%20Dracula">Andy Warhol's Dracula</a>" and "<a href="Flesh%20for%20Frankenstein">Andy Warhol's Frankenstein</a>", were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter "Warhol" films starred <a href="Joe%20Dallesandro">Joe Dallesandro</a>—more of a Morrissey star than a true <a href="Warhol%20superstar">Warhol superstar</a>.

In the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.


In the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band <a href="the%20Velvet%20Underground">the Velvet Underground</a>, making them a crucial element of the <a href="Exploding%20Plastic%20Inevitable">Exploding Plastic Inevitable</a> multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with <a href="Paul%20Morrissey">Paul Morrissey</a>, acted as the band's manager, introducing them to <a href="Nico">Nico</a> (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). In 1966 he "produced" their first album "<a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground%20%26amp%3B%20Nico">The Velvet Underground & Nico</a>", as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader <a href="Lou%20Reed">Lou Reed</a> started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended. In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and <a href="John%20Cale">John Cale</a> re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album "<a href="Songs%20for%20Drella">Songs for Drella</a>", a tribute to Warhol.

Warhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of <a href="John%20Wallowitch">John Wallowitch</a>'s debut album, "This Is John Wallowitch!!!" (1964). He designed the cover art for <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>' albums "<a href="Sticky%20Fingers">Sticky Fingers</a>" (1971) and "<a href="Love%20You%20Live">Love You Live</a>" (1977), and the <a href="John%20Cale">John Cale</a> albums "<a href="The%20Academy%20in%20Peril">The Academy in Peril</a>" (1972) and "<a href="Honi%20Soit%20%28album%29">Honi Soit</a>" in 1981. One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a> for the cover of her 1986 <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">gold album</a> "<a href="Aretha%20%281986%20album%29">Aretha</a>", which was done in the style of the "Reigning Queens" series he had completed the year before.

Warhol strongly influenced the <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a>/<a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> band <a href="Devo">Devo</a>, as well as <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>. Bowie recorded a song called "<a href="Andy%20Warhol%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Andy Warhol</a>" for his 1971 album "<a href="Hunky%20Dory">Hunky Dory</a>". Lou Reed wrote the song "Andy's Chest", about <a href="Valerie%20Solanas">Valerie Solanas</a>, the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the "<a href="VU%20%28album%29">VU</a>" album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, "<a href="Basquiat%20%28film%29">Basquiat</a>". Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:
Beginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.

The first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was "<a href="25%20Cats%20Name%20Sam%20and%20One%20Blue%20Pussy">25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy</a>", printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed "Jerry" on the front cover and given to <a href="Geraldine%20Stutz">Geraldine Stutz</a>, was used for a facsimile printing in 1987, and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by <a href="Doyle%20New%20York">Doyle New York</a>.

Other self-published books by Warhol include:

Warhol's book "A La Recherche du Shoe Perdu" (1955) marked his "transition from commercial to gallery artist". (The title is a <a href="wordplay">play on words</a> by Warhol on the title of French author <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>'s "<a href="%C3%80%20la%20recherche%20du%20temps%20perdu">À la recherche du temps perdu</a>".)

After gaining fame, Warhol "wrote" several books that were commercially published:

Warhol created the fashion magazine "<a href="Interview%20%28magazine%29">Interview</a>" that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.

Although Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.


Warhol had assistance in producing his paintings. This is also true of his film-making and commercial enterprises.

He founded the gossip magazine "<a href="Interview%20%28magazine%29">Interview</a>", a stage for celebrities he "endorsed" and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter <a href="Jean-Michel%20Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>, and the band <a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground">The Velvet Underground</a>, presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian "Superstar" and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from "<a href="Love%20Boat">Love Boat</a>" to "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" and the <a href="Richard%20Pryor">Richard Pryor</a> movie "Dynamite Chicken").

In this respect Warhol was a fan of "Art Business" and "Business Art"—he, in fact, wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in "The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again".

Warhol was <a href="homosexual">gay</a>. Interviewed in 1980, he indicated that he was still a virgin—biographer <a href="Bob%20Colacello">Bob Colacello</a> who was present at the interview felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably "a mixture of <a href="voyeurism">voyeurism</a> and <a href="masturbation">masturbation</a>—to use his [Andy's] word "abstract"". Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for <a href="Genital%20wart">condylomata</a>, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse <a href="BillyBoy%2A">BillyBoy</a> who has said they had sex to orgasm: "When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when you were just alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact when I was with him in public he kind of got on my nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you." Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, <a href="Billy%20Name">Billy Name</a> also denied it, saying: "He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York." "But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front." Warhol's lovers included <a href="John%20Giorno">John Giorno</a>, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was <a href="Jed%20Johnson%20%28designer%29">Jed Johnson</a>, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.

The fact that Warhol's homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications ("e.g.", "Popism: The Warhol 1960s"). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of <a href="Liza%20Minnelli">Liza Minnelli</a>, <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a>, and <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, and films such as "<a href="Blow%20Job%20%28film%29">Blow Job</a>", "My Hustler" and "<a href="Lonesome%20Cowboys%20%281968%20film%29">Lonesome Cowboys</a>") draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.

The first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay. In "Popism", furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker <a href="Emile%20de%20Antonio">Emile de Antonio</a> about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but <a href="closeted">closeted</a>) gay artists <a href="Jasper%20Johns">Jasper Johns</a> and <a href="Robert%20Rauschenberg">Robert Rauschenberg</a>. De Antonio explained that Warhol was "too swish and that upsets them." In response to this, Warhol writes, "There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change ... Other people could change their attitudes but not me". In exploring Warhol's biography, many turn to this period—the late 1950s and early 1960s—as a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like "Um, no" and "Um, yes", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.

Warhol was a practicing <a href="Ruthenian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church">Ruthenian Catholic</a>. He regularly volunteered at <a href="homeless%20shelter">homeless shelter</a>s in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person. Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, "Details of Renaissance Paintings" (1984) and "The Last Supper" (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.

During his life, Warhol regularly attended <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a>, and the priest at Warhol's church, <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20Vincent%20Ferrer%20%28New%20York%29">Saint Vincent Ferrer</a>, said that the artist went there almost daily, although he was not observed taking <a href="Eucharist%23Catholic">Communion</a> or going to <a href="Sacrament%20of%20Penance%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Confession</a> and sat or knelt in the pews at the back. The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a <a href="Roman%20Rite">Roman Rite</a> church <a href="sign%20of%20the%20Cross">crossing himself</a> "in the <a href="Byzantine%20Rite">Orthodox</a> way" (right to left instead of the reverse).

His art is noticeably influenced by the <a href="Eastern%20Christian">Eastern Christian</a> tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.

Warhol's brother has described the artist as "really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private". Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's <a href="eulogy">eulogy</a> <a href="John%20Richardson%20%28art%20historian%29">John Richardson</a> depicted it as devout: "To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one <a href="Conversion%20to%20Christianity">conversion</a>. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood".

Warhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story <a href="townhouse">townhouse</a>, but also a nearby storage unit, as "Andy's Stuff." The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his "Stuff."

Warhol's collections included airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. It also included significant works of art, such as <a href="George%20Bellows">George Bellows</a>'s "<a href="Miss%20Bentham">Miss Bentham</a>". One of his main collections was his <a href="wig">wig</a>s. Warhol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hairpieces, which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote: "I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony."

Another item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a <a href="mummy">mummified</a> human foot from <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>. The curator of anthropology at <a href="Carnegie%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Carnegie Museum of Natural History</a> felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.

Warhol appeared as himself in the film "Cocaine Cowboys" (1979).

After his death, Warhol was portrayed by <a href="Crispin%20Glover">Crispin Glover</a> in <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Doors%20%28film%29">The Doors</a>" (1991), by <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a> in <a href="Julian%20Schnabel">Julian Schnabel</a>'s film "<a href="Basquiat%20%28film%29">Basquiat</a>" (1996), and by <a href="Jared%20Harris">Jared Harris</a> in <a href="Mary%20Harron">Mary Harron</a>'s film "<a href="I%20Shot%20Andy%20Warhol">I Shot Andy Warhol</a>" (1996).

Warhol appears as a character in <a href="Michael%20Daugherty">Michael Daugherty</a>'s opera "<a href="Jackie%20O%20%28the%20opera%29">Jackie O</a>" (1997). Actor Mark Bringleson makes a brief cameo as Warhol in "" (1997).

Many films by avant-garde cineast <a href="Jonas%20Mekas">Jonas Mekas</a> have caught the moments of Warhol's life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the film "<a href="54%20%28film%29">54</a>" (1998). <a href="Guy%20Pearce">Guy Pearce</a> portrayed Warhol in the film "<a href="Factory%20Girl%20%28film%29">Factory Girl</a>" (2007) about <a href="Edie%20Sedgwick">Edie Sedgwick</a>'s life. Actor <a href="Greg%20Travis">Greg Travis</a> portrays Warhol in a brief scene from the film "<a href="Watchmen%20%28film%29">Watchmen</a>" (2009).

In the movie "<a href="Highway%20to%20Hell%20%28film%29">Highway to Hell</a>" a group of Andy Warhols are part of the "Good Intentions Paving Company" where good-intentioned souls are ground into <a href="road%20surface">pavement</a>.

In the film "<a href="Men%20in%20Black%203">Men in Black 3</a>" (2012) Andy Warhol turns out to really be undercover MIB Agent W (played by <a href="Bill%20Hader">Bill Hader</a>). Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is looked up by MIB Agents K and J (J from the future). Agent W is desperate to end his undercover job ("I'm so out of ideas I'm painting soup cans and bananas, for Christ sakes!" and "You gotta fake my death, okay? I can't listen to sitar music anymore.")

Andy Warhol (portrayed by <a href="Tom%20Meeten">Tom Meeten</a>) is one of main characters of the 2012 British television show "<a href="Noel%20Fielding%27s%20Luxury%20Comedy">Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy</a>". The character is portrayed as having robot-like mannerisms.

<a href="Gus%20Van%20Sant">Gus Van Sant</a> was planning a version of Warhol's life with <a href="River%20Phoenix">River Phoenix</a> in the lead role just before Phoenix's death in 1993.

In the soon to be released 2017 feature "<a href="Billionaire%20Boys%20Club%20%282017%20film%29">The Billionaire Boys Club</a>" <a href="Cary%20Elwes">Cary Elwes</a> portrays Warhol in a film based on the true story about Ron Levin (portrayed by <a href="Kevin%20Spacey">Kevin Spacey</a>) a friend of Warhol's who was murdered in 1986.

Alp Arslan

Alp Arslan (honorific in <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> meaning "Heroic Lion"; in ; full name: "Diya ad-Dunya wa ad-Din Adud ad-Dawlah Abu Shuja Muhammad Alp Arslan ibn Dawud" ; 20 January 1029 – 15 December 1072), real name Muhammad bin Dawud Chaghri, was the second <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> of the <a href="Seljuk%20Empire">Seljuk Empire</a> and great-grandson of <a href="Seljuk">Seljuk</a>, the <a href="eponym">eponym</a>ous founder of the dynasty. As Sultan, Alp Arslan greatly expanded Seljuk territory and consolidated power, defeating rivals to his south and northwest. <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">His victory over the Byzantines at Manzikert</a> ushered in the Turkish settlement of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. For his military prowess and fighting skills he obtained the name "Alp Arslan", which means "Heroic Lion" in Turkish.

Alp Arslan accompanied his uncle, <a href="Tughril">Tughril</a> Bey, on campaigns in the south against the <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimids</a> while his father, <a href="%C3%87a%C4%9Fr%C4%B1%20Bey">Çağrı Bey</a>, remained in Khorasan. Upon Alp Arslan's return to Khorasan, he began his work in administration at his father's suggestion. While there, his father introduced him to <a href="Nizam%20al-Mulk">Nizam al-Mulk</a>, one of the most eminent statesmen in early <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> history and Alp Arslan's future <a href="vizier">vizier</a>.

After the death of his father, Alp Arslan succeeded him as governor of <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorasan</a> in 1059. His uncle Tughril died in 1063 and was succeeded by Suleiman, Arslan's brother. Arslan and his uncle <a href="Kutalmish">Kutalmish</a> both contested this succession. ("see" <a href="Battle%20of%20Damghan%20%281063%29">Battle of Damghan (1063)</a>) Arslan defeated Kutalmish for the throne and succeeded on 27 April 1064 as sultan of <a href="Great%20Seljuq">Great Seljuq</a>, thus becoming sole monarch of <a href="Iran">Persia</a> from the river <a href="Oxus">Oxus</a> to the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a>.

In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions, Arslan was ably assisted by Nizam al-Mulk, and the two are credited with helping to stabilize the empire after the death of Tughril. With peace and security established in his dominions, Arslan convoked an assembly of the states and in 1066, he declared his son <a href="Malik%20Shah%20I">Malik Shah I</a> his heir and successor. With the hope of capturing <a href="Caesarea%20Mazaca">Caesarea Mazaca</a>, the capital of <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>, he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, and entered and invaded the city. Along with Nizam al-Mulk, he then marched into <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28Middle%20Ages%29">Armenia</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Georgia">Georgia</a>, which he conquered in 1064. After a siege of 25 days, the Seljuks captured <a href="Ani">Ani</a>, the capital city of Armenia, and slaughtered its population. An account of the sack and massacres in Ani is given by the Arab historian <a href="Sibt%20ibn%20al-Jawzi">Sibt ibn al-Jawzi</a>, who quotes an eyewitness saying:
En route to fight the Fatimids in Syria in 1068, Alp Arslan invaded the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. The <a href="Byzantine%20Emperors">Emperor</a> <a href="Romanos%20IV">Romanos IV</a> Diogenes, assuming command in person, met the invaders in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. In three arduous campaigns, the Turks were defeated in detail and driven across the Euphrates in 1070. The first two campaigns were conducted by the emperor himself, while the third was directed by Manuel Comnenos, great-uncle of Emperor <a href="Manuel%20Comnenus">Manuel Comnenos</a>. During this time, Arslan gained the allegiance of <a href="Rashid%20al-Dawla%20Mahmud">Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud</a>, the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo.

In 1071 Romanos again took the field and advanced into Armenia with possibly 30,000 men, including a contingent of <a href="Cuman">Cuman</a> Turks as well as contingents of <a href="Franks">Franks</a> and <a href="Normans">Normans</a>, under <a href="Roussel%20de%20Bailleul">Ursel de Baieul</a>. Alp Arslan, who had moved his troops south to fight the Fatimids, quickly reversed to meet the Byzantines. At <a href="Manzikert">Manzikert</a>, on the <a href="Murat%20River">Murat River</a>, north of <a href="Lake%20Van">Lake Van</a>, the two forces waged the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a>. The <a href="Cuman">Cuman</a> mercenaries among the Byzantine forces immediately defected to the Turkish side. Seeing this, "the Western mercenaries rode off and took no part in the battle." To be exact, Romanos was betrayed by general <a href="Andronikos%20Doukas%20%28cousin%20of%20Michael%20VII%29">Andronikos Doukas</a>, son of the Caesar (Romanos's stepson), who pronounced him dead and rode off with a large part of the Byzantine forces at a critical moment. The Byzantines were totally routed.

Emperor Romanos IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan. After a ritual humiliation, Arslan treated him with generosity. After peace terms were agreed to, Arslan dismissed the Emperor, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard. The following conversation is said to have taken place after Romanos was brought as a prisoner before the Sultan:

Alp Arslan's victories changed the balance in near Asia completely in favour of the <a href="Seljuq%20Turks">Seljuq Turks</a> and <a href="Sunnite">Sunni</a> Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly four more centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in Anatolia. Most historians, including <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>, date the defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Alp Arslan's strength lay in the military realm. Domestic affairs were handled by his able vizier, <a href="Nizam%20al-Mulk">Nizam al-Mulk</a>, the founder of the administrative organization that characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah. Military <a href="fiefdom">fiefs</a>, governed by Seljuq princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Anatolian agricultural scene. This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedentary Persians, Turks, and other established cultures within the Seljuq realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiers. He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars.

According to the poet <a href="Saadi%20Shirazi">Saadi Shirazi</a>:

Arslan possessed a fort, which raised at the height of Alwand, from all were those within its walls, for its roads were a labyrinth, like the curls of a bride. From a learned traveler Arslan once inquired: "Didst thou ever, in thy wanderings, see a fort as strong as this?" "Splendid it is," was the traveler's reply, "but methinks not it confers much strength. Before thee, did not other kings possess it for a while, then pass away? After thee, will not other kings assume control, and eat the fruits of the tree of thy hope?"

In the estimation of the wise, the world is a false gem that passes each moment from one hand to another. (The fort was sacked by the Mongols led by <a href="Hulagu">Hulagu</a>.)
<a href="Suleyman%20I%20of%20R%C3%BBm">Suleiman ibn Kutalmish</a> was the son of the contender for Arslan's throne; he was appointed governor of the north-western provinces and assigned to completing the invasion of Anatolia. An explanation for this choice can only be conjectured from <a href="Ibn%20al-Athir">Ibn al-Athir</a>’s account of the battle between Alp-Arslan and <a href="Kutalmish">Kutalmish</a>, in which he writes that Alp-Arslan wept for the latter's death and greatly mourned the loss of his kinsman.

After Manzikert, the dominion of Alp Arslan extended over much of western <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. He soon prepared to march for the conquest of <a href="Turkestan">Turkestan</a>, the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, <a href="Yussuf%20al-Kharezmi">Yussuf al-Kharezmi</a>, a <a href="Khwarezmid%20Empire">Khwarezmian</a>. He was obliged to surrender, however, and was carried as a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to death. Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan. Alp Arslan, who took great pride in his reputation as an archer, motioned to his guards not to interfere. He drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast. Alp Arslan died from this wound four days later, on 25 November 1072, in his 42nd year, and he was taken to <a href="Merv">Merv</a> to be buried next to his father, <a href="Chaghri%20Beg">Chaghri Beg</a>.

Alp Arslan is widely regarded as having begun <a href="Anatolianism">Anatolianism</a>, although unintentionally. His victory at Manzikert is often cited as the beginning of the end of Byzantine power in Anatolia, and the beginning of Turkish identity there.

Alp Arslan's conquest of Anatolia from the Byzantines is also seen as one of the pivotal precursors to the launch of the <a href="crusade">crusade</a>s.

From 2002 to July 2008 under <a href="Renaming%20of%20Turkmen%20months%20and%20days%20of%20week%2C%202002">Turkmen calendar reform</a>, the month of August was named after Alp Arslan.

Kurosawa entered the <a href="Japanese%20film">Japanese film</a> industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a> and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular <a href="action%20film">action film</a> "<a href="Sanshiro%20Sugata">Sanshiro Sugata</a>" (a.k.a.

After the war, the critically acclaimed "<a href="Drunken%20Angel">Drunken Angel</a>" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor <a href="Toshiro%20Mifune">Toshiro Mifune</a> in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films.

"<a href="Rashomon">Rashomon</a>", which premiered in Tokyo, became the surprise winner of the <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a> at the 1952 <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>. The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded (and often adapted) films, such as "<a href="Ikiru">Ikiru</a>" (1952), "<a href="Seven%20Samurai">Seven Samurai</a>" (1954) and "<a href="Yojimbo%20%28film%29">Yojimbo</a>" (1961). After the 1960s, he became much less prolific, though his later work—including his final two epics, "<a href="Kagemusha">Kagemusha</a>" (1980) and "<a href="Ran%20%28film%29">Ran</a>" (1985)—continued to win awards though more often abroad than in Japan.

In 1990, he accepted the <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for <a href="Academy%20Honorary%20Award">Lifetime Achievement</a>. Posthumously, he was named "<a href="Asian%20of%20the%20Century">Asian of the Century</a>" in the "Arts, Literature, and Culture" category by "<a href="AsianWeek">AsianWeek</a>" magazine and <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, cited there as being among the five people who most prominently contributed to the improvement of Asia in the past century. His career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many consumer media formats.

 was born on March 23, 1910, in <a href="%C5%8Cimachi%20Station">Ōimachi</a> in the <a href="%C5%8Cmori">Ōmori</a> district of Tokyo. His father Isamu, a member of a former <a href="samurai">samurai</a> family from <a href="Akita%20Prefecture">Akita Prefecture</a>, worked as the director of the Army's Physical Education Institute's <a href="Secondary%20education%20in%20Japan%23Middle%20school">lower secondary school</a>, while his mother Shima came from a merchant's family living in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a>. Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa to grow up with three sisters and a brother.

In addition to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa was open to <a href="Western%20world">Western traditions</a> and considered theater and motion pictures to have educational merit. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies at the age of six. An important formative influence was his <a href="Elementary%20schools%20in%20Japan">elementary school</a> teacher Mr Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general. During this time, the boy also studied <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a> and <a href="Kendo">Kendo</a> swordsmanship.

Another major childhood influence was Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In the aftermath of the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a> of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.

Heigo was academically gifted, but soon after failing to secure a place in Tokyo's foremost <a href="Secondary%20education%20in%20Japan%23Upper%20secondary%20school">high school</a>, he began to detach himself from the rest of the family, preferring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature. In the late 1920s, Heigo became a <a href="benshi">benshi</a> (silent film narrator) for Tokyo theaters showing foreign films, and quickly made a name for himself. Akira, who at this point planned to become a painter, moved in with him, and the two brothers became inseparable. With Heigo's guidance, Akira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances, while exhibiting his paintings and working for the left-wing Proletarian Artists' League. However, he was never able to make a living with his art, and, as he began to perceive most of the proletarian movement as "putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto the canvas", he lost his enthusiasm for painting.

With the increasing production of <a href="Sound%20film">talking pictures</a> in the early 1930s, film narrators like Heigo began to lose work, and Akira moved back in with his parents. In July 1933, Heigo committed suicide. Kurosawa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brother's death and the chapter of his autobiography ("<a href="Something%20Like%20an%20Autobiography">Something Like an Autobiography</a>") that describes it—written nearly half a century after the event—is titled, "A Story I Don't Want to Tell". Only four months later, Kurosawa's eldest brother also died, leaving Akira, at age 23, the only one of the Kurosawa brothers still living, together with his three surviving sisters.

In 1935, the new film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, <a href="Toho">Toho</a>), advertised for assistant directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films and find ways to overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental, there was no way to correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director <a href="Kajir%C5%8D%20Yamamoto">Kajirō Yamamoto</a>, who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.

During his five years as an assistant director, Kurosawa worked under numerous directors, but by far the most important figure in his development was Yamamoto. Of his 24 films as A.D., he worked on 17 under Yamamoto, many of them comedies featuring the popular actor <a href="Ken%27ichi%20Enomoto">Ken'ichi Enomoto</a>, known as "Enoken". Yamamoto nurtured Kurosawa's talent, promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year. Kurosawa's responsibilities increased, and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location scouting, script polishing, rehearsals, lighting, dubbing, editing and second-unit directing. In the last of Kurosawa's films as an assistant director for Yamamoto, <a href="Horse%20%28Uma%2C%201941%29">"Horse" ("Uma", 1941)</a>, Kurosawa took over most of the production, as his mentor was occupied with the shooting of another film.

One important piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director <a href="Satsuo%20Yamamoto">Satsuo Yamamoto</a>'s film, "<a href="Tsubasa%20no%20gaika">A Triumph of Wings</a>" ("Tsubasa no gaika", 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.

In the two years following the release of "Horse" in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, about a year after the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his <a href="Musashi%20%28novel%29">Musashi Miyamoto</a>-inspired judo novel, "Sanshiro Sugata", the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.
Shooting of "<a href="Sanshiro%20Sugata">Sanshiro Sugata</a>" began on location in Yokohama in December 1942. Production proceeded smoothly, but getting the completed film past the censors was an entirely different matter. The censorship office considered the work to be objectionably "British-American" by the standards of wartime Japan, and it was only through the intervention of director <a href="Yasujir%C5%8D%20Ozu">Yasujirō Ozu</a>, who championed the film, that "Sanshiro Sugata" was finally accepted for release on March 25, 1943. (Kurosawa had just turned 33.) The movie became both a critical and commercial success. Nevertheless, the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage, much of which is now considered lost.

He next turned to the subject of wartime female factory workers in "<a href="The%20Most%20Beautiful">The Most Beautiful</a>", a propaganda film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.

During production, the actress playing the leader of the factory workers, <a href="Y%C5%8Dko%20Yaguchi">Yōko Yaguchi</a>, was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director. She and Kurosawa were constantly at loggerheads, and it was through these arguments that the two, paradoxically, became close. They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant (she never resumed her acting career), and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985. They would have two children: a son, Hisao, born December 20, 1945, who would serve as producer on some of his father's last projects, and <a href="Kazuko%20Kurosawa">Kazuko</a>, a daughter, born April 29, 1954, who would become a costume designer.

Shortly before his marriage, Kurosawa was pressured by the studio against his will to direct a sequel to his debut film. The often blatantly propagandistic "<a href="Sanshiro%20Sugata%20Part%20II">Sanshiro Sugata Part II</a>", which premiered in May 1945, is generally considered one of his weakest pictures.

Kurosawa decided to write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less expensive to produce. "<a href="The%20Men%20Who%20Tread%20on%20the%20Tiger%27s%20Tail">The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail</a>", based on the Kabuki play "<a href="Kanjinch%C5%8D">Kanjinchō</a>" and starring the comedian Enoken, with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days, was completed in September 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the <a href="occupation%20of%20Japan">occupation of Japan</a> had begun. The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly "feudal" and banned the work. (It would not be released until 1952, the year another Kurosawa film, "Ikiru", was also released.) Ironically, while in production, the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and "democratic" (they particularly disliked the comic porter played by Enoken), so the movie most probably would not have seen the light of day even if the war had continued beyond its completion.

After the war, Kurosawa, influenced by the democratic ideals of the Occupation, sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards the individual and the self. The first such film, "<a href="No%20Regrets%20for%20Our%20Youth">No Regrets for Our Youth</a>" (1946), inspired by both the 1933 <a href="Takigawa%20incident">Takigawa incident</a> and the <a href="Hotsumi%20Ozaki">Hotsumi Ozaki</a> wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie (<a href="Setsuko%20Hara">Setsuko Hara</a>), who born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title into a postwar <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a>.

His next film, "<a href="One%20Wonderful%20Sunday">One Wonderful Sunday</a>" premiered in July 1947 to mixed reviews. It is a relatively uncomplicated and sentimental love story dealing with an impoverished postwar couple trying to enjoy, within the devastation of postwar Tokyo, their one weekly day off. The movie bears the influence of <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>, <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D. W. Griffith</a> and <a href="F.%20W.%20Murnau">F. W. Murnau</a>, each of whom was among Kurosawa's favorite directors. Another film released in 1947 with Kurosawa's involvement was the action-adventure thriller, "<a href="Snow%20Trail">Snow Trail</a>", directed by <a href="Senkichi%20Taniguchi">Senkichi Taniguchi</a> from Kurosawa's screenplay. It marked the debut of the intense young actor Toshiro Mifune. It was Kurosawa who, with his mentor Yamamoto, had intervened to persuade Toho to sign Mifune, during an audition in which the young man greatly impressed Kurosawa, but managed to alienate most of the other judges.
"<a href="Drunken%20Angel">Drunken Angel</a>" is often considered the director's first major work. Although the script, like all of Kurosawa's occupation-era works, had to go through forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster (<a href="yakuza">yakuza</a>) with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, it was also the director's first film with Toshiro Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one ("Ikiru") of the director's next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in "Drunken Angel", his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by <a href="Takashi%20Shimura">Takashi Shimura</a>, who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>'s defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious <a href="Kinema%20Junpo">Kinema Junpo</a> critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.

Kurosawa, with producer Sōjirō Motoki and fellow directors and friends Kajiro Yamamoto, <a href="Mikio%20Naruse">Mikio Naruse</a> and <a href="Senkichi%20Taniguchi">Senkichi Taniguchi</a>, formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association (Eiga Geijutsu Kyōkai). For this organization's debut work, and first film for <a href="Kadokawa%20Pictures">Daiei studios</a>, Kurosawa turned to a contemporary play by Kazuo Kikuta and, together with Taniguchi, adapted it for the screen. "<a href="The%20Quiet%20Duel">The Quiet Duel</a>" starred Toshiro Mifune as an idealistic young doctor struggling with <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, a deliberate attempt by Kurosawa to break the actor away from being <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as gangsters. Released in March 1949, it was a box office success, but is generally considered one of the director's lesser achievements.

His second film of 1949, also produced by Film Art Association and released by <a href="Shintoho">Shintoho</a>, was "<a href="Stray%20Dog%20%28film%29">Stray Dog</a>". It is a <a href="Mystery%20film">detective movie</a> (perhaps the first important Japanese film in that genre) that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery through the story of a young detective, played by Mifune, and his fixation on the recovery of his handgun, which was stolen by a penniless war veteran who proceeds to use it to rob and murder. Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his, <a href="Georges%20Simenon">Georges Simenon</a>, it was the director's first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima, who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films. A famous, virtually wordless sequence, lasting over eight minutes, shows the detective, disguised as an impoverished veteran, wandering the streets in search of the gun thief; it employed actual documentary footage of war-ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawa's friend, <a href="Ishir%C5%8D%20Honda">Ishirō Honda</a>, the future director of "Gojira" (a.k.a. "<a href="Godzilla%20%281954%20film%29">Godzilla</a>"). The film is considered a precursor to the contemporary <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> and <a href="buddy%20cop%20film">buddy cop film</a> genres.

"<a href="Scandal%20%281950%20film%29">Scandal</a>", released by <a href="Shochiku">Shochiku</a> in April 1950, was inspired by the director's personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese <a href="yellow%20journalism">yellow journalism</a>. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the finished product as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree. However, it would be Kurosawa's second film of 1950, "<a href="Rashomon%20%28film%29">Rashomon</a>", that would ultimately win him, and Japanese cinema, a whole new international audience.

After finishing "Scandal", Kurosawa was approached by <a href="Kadokawa%20Pictures">Daiei studios</a>, which asked the director to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, <a href="Shinobu%20Hashimoto">Shinobu Hashimoto</a>, with whom he would eventually work on nine of his films. Their first joint effort was based on <a href="Ry%C5%ABnosuke%20Akutagawa">Ryūnosuke Akutagawa</a>'s experimental short story "<a href="In%20a%20Grove">In a Grove</a>", which recounts the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points-of-view. Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.

Shooting of "Rashomon" began on July 7, 1950, and, after extensive location work in the primeval forest of <a href="Nara%2C%20Nara">Nara</a>, wrapped on August 17. Just one week was spent in hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyo's Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day. The movie was met by lukewarm reviews, with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment, but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei.
Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was "<a href="The%20Idiot%20%281951%20film%29">The Idiot</a>", an adaptation of the novel by the director's favorite writer, <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoyevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a>. The filmmaker relocated the story from Russia to <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>, but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes (nearly four-and-a-half hours) to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. It is widely considered today to be one of the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Kurosawa, "Rashomon" had been entered in the prestigious <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>, due to the efforts of <a href="Giuliana%20Stramigioli">Giuliana Stramigioli</a>, a Japan-based representative of an Italian film company, who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, "Rashomon" was awarded the festival's highest prize, the <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a>, shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, which at the time was largely unaware of Japan's decades-old cinematic tradition.

After Daiei very briefly exhibited a subtitled print of the film in Los Angeles, <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO</a> purchased distribution rights to "Rashomon" in the United States. The company was taking a considerable gamble. It had put out only one prior subtitled film in the American market, and the only previous Japanese talkie commercially released in New York had been <a href="Mikio%20Naruse">Mikio Naruse</a>'s comedy, "Wife! Be Like a Rose", in 1937: a critical and box-office flop. However, "Rashomon"s commercial run, greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even the columnist <a href="Ed%20Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</a>, was very successful. (It earned $35,000 in its first three weeks at a single New York theater, an almost unheard-of sum at the time.)

This success in turn led to a vogue in America and the West for Japanese movies throughout the 1950s, replacing the enthusiasm for <a href="Italian%20neorealism">Italian neorealist</a> cinema. For example, by the end of 1952 "Rashamon" was released in Japan, the United States, and most of Europe. Among the Japanese filmmakers whose work, as a result, began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi ("<a href="The%20Life%20of%20Oharu">The Life of Oharu</a>", "<a href="Ugetsu">Ugetsu</a>", "<a href="Sansho%20the%20Bailiff">Sansho the Bailiff</a>") and, somewhat later, Yasujirō Ozu ("<a href="Tokyo%20Story">Tokyo Story</a>", "<a href="An%20Autumn%20Afternoon">An Autumn Afternoon</a>")—artists highly respected in Japan but, prior to this period, almost totally unknown in the West. Kurosawa's growing reputation among Western audiences in the 1950s would make Western audiences more sympathetic to the reception of later generations of Japanese filmmakers ranging from <a href="Kon%20Ichikawa">Kon Ichikawa</a>, <a href="Masaki%20Kobayashi">Masaki Kobayashi</a>, <a href="Nagisa%20Oshima">Nagisa Oshima</a> and <a href="Shohei%20Imamura">Shohei Imamura</a> to <a href="Juzo%20Itami">Juzo Itami</a>, <a href="Takeshi%20Kitano">Takeshi Kitano</a> and <a href="Takashi%20Miike">Takashi Miike</a>.

His career boosted by his sudden international fame, Kurosawa, now reunited with his original film studio, Toho (which would go on to produce his next 11 films), set to work on his next project, "<a href="Ikiru">Ikiru</a>". The movie stars Takashi Shimura as a cancer-ridden Tokyo bureaucrat, Watanabe, on a final quest for meaning before his death. For the screenplay, Kurosawa brought in Hashimoto as well as writer Hideo Oguni, who would go on to co-write 12 Kurosawa films. Despite the work's grim subject matter, the screenwriters took a satirical approach, which some have compared to the work of <a href="Berthold%20Brecht">Brecht</a>, to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U.S. cultural colonization of Japan. (American pop songs figure prominently in the film.) Because of this strategy, the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture from the kind of sentimentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses. "Ikiru" opened in October 1952 to rave reviews—it won Kurosawa his second Kinema Junpo "Best Film" award—and enormous box office success. It remains the most acclaimed of all the artist's films set in the modern era.

In December 1952, Kurosawa took his "Ikiru" screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five-day secluded residence at an inn to create the screenplay for his next movie, "<a href="Seven%20Samurai">Seven Samurai</a>". The <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble</a> work was Kurosawa's first proper <a href="samurai%20cinema">samurai film</a>, the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in <a href="Sengoku%20period">Sengoku period</a> Japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast (largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions) and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours of screen time.

Three months were spent in pre-production and a month in rehearsals. Shooting took up 148 days spread over almost a year, interrupted by production and financing troubles and Kurosawa's health problems. The film finally opened in April 1954, half a year behind its original release date and about three times over budget, making it at the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made. (However, by Hollywood standards, it was a quite modestly budgeted production, even for that time). The film received positive critical reaction and became a big hit, quickly making back the money invested in it and providing the studio with a product that they could, and did, market internationally—though with extensive edits. Over time—and with the theatrical and home video releases of the uncut version—its reputation has steadily grown. It is now regarded by some commentators as the greatest Japanese film ever made, and in 1979, a poll of Japanese film critics also voted it the best Japanese film ever made. In the most recent (2012) version of the widely respected <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> (BFI) "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" "Greatest Films of All Time" poll, "Seven Samurai" placed 17th among all films from all countries in both the critics' and the directors' polls, receiving a place in the Top Ten lists of 48 critics and 22 directors.

In 1954, nuclear tests in the Pacific were causing radioactive rainstorms in Japan and one particular <a href="Daigo%20Fukury%C5%AB%20Maru">incident</a> in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to <a href="nuclear%20fallout">nuclear fallout</a>, with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawa's next film, "<a href="I%20Live%20in%20Fear">Record of a Living Being</a>", was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner (Toshiro Mifune) so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family (both legal and extra-marital) to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much more smoothly than the director's previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawa's composer, collaborator and close friend <a href="Fumio%20Hayasaka">Fumio Hayasaka</a> died (of tuberculosis) at the age of 41. The film's score was finished by Hayasaka's student, <a href="Masaru%20Sato">Masaru Sato</a>, who would go on to score all of Kurosawa's next eight films. "Record of a Living Being" opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run. Today, it is considered by many to be among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.

Kurosawa's next project, "<a href="Throne%20of%20Blood">Throne of Blood</a>", an adaptation of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>"—set, like "Seven Samurai", in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress, <a href="Isuzu%20Yamada">Isuzu Yamada</a>, to regard the work as if it were a cinematic version of a "Japanese" rather than a European literary classic. Given Kurosawa's appreciation of traditional Japanese stage acting, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the <a href="Noh">Noh</a> theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the director's previous film. Abroad, "Throne of Blood", regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.

Another adaptation of a classic European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of "<a href="The%20Lower%20Depths%20%281957%20film%29">The Lower Depths</a>", based on a <a href="The%20Lower%20Depths">play</a> by <a href="Maxim%20Gorky">Maxim Gorky</a>, taking place in May and June 1957. In contrast to the Shakespearean sweep of "Throne of Blood", "The Lower Depths" was shot on only two confined sets, in order to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful to the play, this adaptation of Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late <a href="Tokugawa%20era">Edo period</a>—unlike his earlier "The Idiot", was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response similar to that of "Throne of Blood". However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.

Kurosawa's three consecutive movies after "Seven Samurai" had not managed to capture Japanese audiences in the way that that film had. The mood of the director's work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark, with the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned, particularly in "Throne of Blood" and "The Lower Depths". He recognized this, and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production, while switching to the new <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film, "<a href="The%20Hidden%20Fortress">The Hidden Fortress</a>", is an action-adventure comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, "The Hidden Fortress" became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics both in Japan and abroad. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawa's most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences on <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>'s 1977 <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a>, "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>".

Starting with "Rashomon", Kurosawa's productions had become increasingly large in scope and so had the director's budgets. Toho, concerned about this development, suggested that he might help finance his own works, therefore making the studio's potential losses smaller, while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co-producer. Kurosawa agreed, and the Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959, with Toho as majority shareholder.

Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a story that was more directly critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work. "<a href="The%20Bad%20Sleep%20Well">The Bad Sleep Well</a>", based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about a young man who is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new <a href="Treaty%20of%20Mutual%20Cooperation%20and%20Security%20between%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Japan">U.S.-Japan Security treaty</a>, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.

"<a href="Yojimbo%20%28film%29">Yojimbo</a>" ("The Bodyguard"), Kurosawa Production's second film, centers on a masterless samurai, Sanjuro, who strolls into a 19th-century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provokes them into destroying each other. The director used this work to play with many genre conventions, particularly the <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Western</a>, while at the same time offering an unprecedentedly (for the Japanese screen) graphic portrayal of violence. Some commentators have seen the Sanjuro character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the samurai class. Featuring <a href="Tatsuya%20Nakadai">Tatsuya Nakadai</a> in his first major role in a Kurosawa movie, and with innovative photography by <a href="Kazuo%20Miyagawa">Kazuo Miyagawa</a> (who shot "Rashomon") and <a href="Takao%20Saito%20%28cinematographer%29">Takao Saito</a>, the film premiered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture, earning more than any previous Kurosawa film. The movie and its <a href="Black%20comedy">blackly comic</a> tone were also widely imitated abroad. <a href="Sergio%20Leone">Sergio Leone</a>'s "<a href="A%20Fistful%20of%20Dollars">A Fistful of Dollars</a>" was a virtual (unauthorized) scene-by-scene remake with Toho filing a lawsuit on Kurosawa's behalf and prevailing.
Following the success of "Yojimbo", Kurosawa found himself under pressure from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before "Yojimbo", reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. "<a href="Sanjuro">Sanjuro</a>" was the first of three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer <a href="Sh%C5%ABgor%C5%8D%20Yamamoto">Shūgorō Yamamoto</a> (the others would be "Red Beard" and "Dodeskaden"). It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than "Yojimbo", though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing "Yojimbo"s box office success and garnering positive reviews.

Kurosawa had meanwhile instructed Toho to purchase the film rights to "King's Ransom", a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter <a href="Evan%20Hunter">Evan Hunter</a>, under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, as one of his <a href="87th%20Precinct">87th Precinct</a> series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled "<a href="High%20and%20Low%20%281963%20film%29">High and Low</a>", was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a row to do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). "High and Low" is considered by many commentators to be among the director's strongest works.

Kurosawa quickly moved on to his next project, "<a href="Red%20Beard">Red Beard</a>". Based on a short story collection by Shūgorō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoyevsky's novel "<a href="Humiliated%20and%20Insulted">The Insulted and Injured</a>", it is a period film, set in a mid-nineteenth century clinic for the poor, in which Kurosawa's humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement. A conceited and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as "Akahige" ("Red Beard"), played by Mifune. Although he resists Red Beard initially, Yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage, and to perceive the patients at the clinic, whom he at first despised, as worthy of compassion and dignity.

<a href="Y%C5%ABz%C5%8D%20Kayama">Yūzō Kayama</a>, who plays Yasumoto, was an extremely popular film and music star at the time, particularly for his "Young Guy" ("Wakadaishō") series of musical comedies, so signing him to appear in the film virtually guaranteed Kurosawa strong box-office. The shoot, the filmmaker's longest ever, lasted well over a year (after five months of pre-production), and wrapped in spring 1965, leaving the director, his crew and his actors exhausted. "Red Beard" premiered in April 1965, becoming the year's highest-grossing Japanese production and the third (and last) Kurosawa film to top the prestigious Kinema Jumpo yearly critics poll. It remains one of Kurosawa's best-known and most-loved works in his native country. Outside Japan, critics have been much more divided. Most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kurosawa's best, while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power, with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artist's previous commitment to social and political change.

The film marked something of an end of an era for its creator. The director himself recognized this at the time of its release, telling critic <a href="Donald%20Richie">Donald Richie</a> that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.

"Red Beard" also marked the midway point, chronologically, in the artist's career. During his previous twenty-nine years in the film industry (which includes his five years as assistant director), he had directed twenty-three films, while during the remaining twenty-eight years, for many and complex reasons, he would complete only seven more. Also, for reasons never adequately explained, "Red Beard" would be his final film starring Toshiro Mifune. Yu Fujiki, an actor who worked on "The Lower Depths", observed, regarding the closeness of the two men on the set, "Mr. Kurosawa's heart was in Mr. Mifune's body." Donald Richie has described the rapport between them as a unique "symbiosis".

When Kurosawa's exclusive contract with Toho came to an end in 1966, the 56-year-old director was seriously contemplating change. Observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry, and having already received dozens of offers from abroad, the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him as never before.

For his first foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story based on a <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life" magazine</a> article. The <a href="Embassy%20Pictures">Embassy Pictures</a> action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply "Runaway Train", would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, <a href="Andrei%20Konchalovsky">Andrei Konchalovsky</a>, would finally make "<a href="Runaway%20Train%20%28film%29">Runaway Train</a>", though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.
The director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project. "<a href="Tora%21%20Tora%21%20Tora%21">Tora! Tora! Tora!</a>", produced by <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> and Kurosawa Production, would be a portrayal of the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> from both the American and the Japanese points-of-view, with Kurosawa helming the Japanese half and an English-speaking filmmaker directing the American half. He spent several months working on the script with Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni, but very soon the project began to unravel. The director chosen to film the American sequences turned out not to be the prestigious English filmmaker <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a>, as the producers had led Kurosawa to believe, but the much less celebrated special effects expert, <a href="Richard%20Fleischer">Richard Fleischer</a>. The budget was also cut, and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes—a major problem, considering that Kurosawa's script ran over four hours. After numerous revisions, a more or less finalized cut screenplay was agreed upon in May 1968. Shooting began in early December, but Kurosawa would last only a little over three weeks as director. He struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production, while his working methods puzzled his American producers, who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill. On Christmas Eve 1968, the Americans announced that Kurosawa had left the production due to "fatigue", effectively firing him. (He was ultimately replaced, for the film's Japanese sequences, with two directors, <a href="Kinji%20Fukasaku">Kinji Fukasaku</a> and <a href="Toshio%20Masuda%20%28director%29">Toshio Masuda</a>.)

"Tora! Tora! Tora!", finally released to unenthusiastic reviews in September 1970, was, as Donald Richie put it, an "almost unmitigated tragedy" in Kurosawa's career. He had spent years of his life on a logistically nightmarish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself. (He had his name removed from the credits, though the script used for the Japanese half was still his and his co-writers'.) He became estranged from his longtime collaborator, writer Ryuzo Kikushima, and never worked with him again. The project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company (a situation reminiscent of his own movie, "The Bad Sleep Well"). His very sanity had been called into question. Worst of all, the Japanese film industry—and perhaps the man himself—began to suspect that he would never make another film.

Knowing that his reputation was at stake following the much publicised "Tora! Tora! Tora!" debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors <a href="Keisuke%20Kinoshita">Keisuke Kinoshita</a>, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, it has been suggested that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.

The first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called "Dora-Heita", but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to "<a href="Dodesukaden">Dodesukaden</a>", an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but "Dodesukaden" has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.

Unable to secure funding for further work and allegedly suffering from health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the director's health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain if he would ever direct another film.

In early 1973, the Soviet studio <a href="Mosfilm">Mosfilm</a> approached the filmmaker to ask if he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer <a href="Vladimir%20Arsenyev">Vladimir Arsenyev</a>'s autobiographical work "<a href="Dersu%20Uzala">Dersu Uzala</a>". The book, about a <a href="Nani%20people">Goldi</a> hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. "<a href="Dersu%20Uzala%20%281975%20film%29">Dersu Uzala</a>" had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the <a href="9th%20Moscow%20International%20Film%20Festival">9th Moscow International Film Festival</a>, as well as an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a>. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others count it among his finest works.

Although proposals for television projects were submitted to him, he had no interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for <a href="Suntory">Suntory</a> whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories.

In 1977, American director George Lucas had released "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>", a wildly successful science fiction film influenced by Kurosawa's "The Hidden Fortress", among other works. Lucas, like many other <a href="New%20Hollywood">New Hollywood</a> directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and was shocked to discover that the Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: "<a href="Kagemusha">Kagemusha</a>", the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce "Kagemusha", then recruited fellow fan <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> as co-producer.

Production began the following April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, not the least of which was the firing of the original lead actor, <a href="Shintaro%20Katsu">Shintaro Katsu</a>—creator of the very popular <a href="Zatoichi">Zatoichi</a> character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his own performance. (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a href="1980%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1980 Cannes Film Festival</a> in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting "Kagemusha", collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.
The international success of "Kagemusha" allowed Kurosawa to proceed with his next project, "<a href="Ran%20%28film%29">Ran</a>", another epic in a similar vein. The script, partly based on <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", depicted a ruthless, bloodthirsty "<a href="daimy%C5%8D">daimyō</a>" (warlord), played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who, after foolishly banishing his one loyal son, surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons, who then betray him, thus plunging the entire kingdom into war. As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country, international help was again needed. This time it came from French producer <a href="Serge%20Silberman">Serge Silberman</a>, who had produced <a href="Luis%20Bu%C3%B1uel">Luis Buñuel</a>'s final movies. Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year.

In January 1985, production of "Ran" was halted as Kurosawa's 64-year-old wife Yōko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned to finish his film and "Ran" premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on 31 May, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one abroad and, as he had done with "Kagemusha", Kurosawa embarked on a trip to Europe and America, where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.

"Ran" won several awards in Japan, but was not quite as honored there as many of the director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the selection of "Ran" in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Best Foreign Film</a> category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the <a href="57th%20Academy%20Awards">57th Academy Awards</a>. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit "Ran" for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether "Ran" qualified as a "Japanese" film, a "French" film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director <a href="Sidney%20Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a> led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Directing">Best Directing</a> that year (<a href="Sydney%20Pollack">Sydney Pollack</a> ultimately won the award for directing "<a href="Out%20of%20Africa%20%28film%29">Out of Africa</a>"). "Ran"s costume designer, <a href="Emi%20Wada">Emi Wada</a>, won the movie's only Oscar.

"Kagemusha" and "Ran", particularly the latter, are often considered to be among Kurosawa's finest works. After "Ran"s release, Kurosawa would point to it as his best film, a major change of attitude for the director who, when asked which of his works was his best, had always previously answered "my next one".
For his next movie, Kurosawa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before. While some of his previous pictures (for example, "Drunken Angel" and "Kagemusha") had included brief dream sequences, "<a href="Dreams%20%281990%20film%29">Dreams</a>" was to be entirely based upon the director's own dreams. Significantly, for the first time in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this deeply personal project, wrote the screenplay alone. Although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it, Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions, so Kurosawa turned to another famous American fan, <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, who convinced <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> to buy the international rights to the completed film. This made it easier for Kurosawa's son, Hisao, as co-producer and soon-to-be head of Kurosawa Production, to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the film's production costs. Shooting took more than eight months to complete, and "Dreams" premiered at Cannes in May 1990 to a polite but muted reception, similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world. In 1990, he accepted the <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for <a href="Academy%20Honorary%20Award">Lifetime Achievement</a>.
Kurosawa now turned to a more conventional story with "<a href="Rhapsody%20in%20August">Rhapsody in August</a>"—the director's first film fully produced in Japan since "Dodeskaden" over twenty years before—which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki at the very end of World War II. It was adapted from a Kiyoko Murata novel, but the film's references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book. This was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star: Richard Gere, who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine. Shooting took place in early 1991, with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction, especially in the United States, where the director was accused of promulgating naïvely anti-American sentiments, though Kurosawa rejected these accusations.

Kurosawa wasted no time moving onto his next project: "<a href="Madadayo">Madadayo</a>", or "Not Yet". Based on autobiographical essays by <a href="Hyakken%20Uchida">Hyakken Uchida</a>, the film follows the life of a Japanese professor of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.

Kurosawa nevertheless continued to work. He wrote the original screenplays "The Sea is Watching" in 1993 and "After the Rain" in 1995. While putting finishing touches on the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke the base of his spine. Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film. His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie—was never to be fulfilled.

After his accident, Kurosawa's health began to deteriorate. While his mind remained sharp and lively, his body was giving up, and for the last half-year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a stroke in <a href="Setagaya%2C%20Tokyo">Setagaya, Tokyo</a>, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, Kurosawa had two children, his son <a href="Dreams%20%281990%20film%29">Hisao Kurosawa</a> who married <a href="Hiroko%20Hayashi%20%28singer%29">Hiroko Hayashi</a> and his daughter <a href="Kazuko%20Kurosawa">Kazuko Kurosawa</a> who married Harayuki Kato, along with several grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, the actor <a href="After%20the%20Rain%20%28film%29">Takayuki Kato</a> and , became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by Kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime, <a href="Takashi%20Koizumi">Takashi Koizumi</a>'s "<a href="After%20the%20Rain%20%28film%29">After the Rain</a>" (1999) and <a href="Kei%20Kumai">Kei Kumai</a>'s "The Sea is Watching" (2002).

From the beginning, Kurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly influenced by Western cinema yet quite distinct from it. Kurosawa was extensively involved with every aspect of <a href="filmmaking">film production</a>. He was also a gifted screenwriter, and would usually work in close collaboration with his co-writers from the beginning of the development of a film to ensure a high-quality script, which he insisted was the absolute foundation of a good film. He frequently served as editor of his own films and was regarded by his production team as "the greatest editor in the world." Though it was common in the Japanese film industry of that time for established directors to assemble around them a team, or "gumi," with people drawn from the same pool of creative technicians, crew members and actors working from film to film (for example, the director <a href="Hiroshi%20Inagaki">Hiroshi Inagaki</a>, who worked at Toho during the same period as Kurosawa, had such a team), Kurosawa's team, known as the "Kurosawa-gumi" (Kurosawa group)—including, for example, the cinematographer <a href="Asakazu%20Nakai">Asakazu Nakai</a>, the production assistant Teruyo Nogami and the actor <a href="Takashi%20Shimura">Takashi Shimura</a>—was remarkable for its loyalty to the director and the consistent quality of its work.

Kurosawa's style is marked by a number of devices and techniques which Kurosawa introduced in his films over the decades. In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the "<a href="axial%20cut">axial cut</a>", in which the camera moves closer to, or further away from, the subject, not through the use of <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a>s or <a href="Dissolve%20%28filmmaking%29">dissolves</a>, but through a series of matched <a href="jump%20cut">jump cut</a>s. Another stylistic trait which scholars have pointed out is Kurosawa's tendency to "cut on motion": that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot.

A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the <a href="Wipe%20%28transition%29">wipe</a>. This is an effect created through an <a href="optical%20printer">optical printer</a>, in which, when a scene ends, a line or bar appears to move across the screen, "wiping" away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene. As a transitional device, it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the <a href="Dissolve%20%28filmmaking%29">dissolve</a> (though Kurosawa often used both of those devices as well). In his mature work, Kurosawa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature. For example, one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in "Drunken Angel". Kurosawa by all accounts always gave great attention to the soundtracks of his films, especially with an emphasis on sound-image counterpoint, in which the music or sound effects would ironically comment upon the image rather than merely reinforcing it. (Teruyo Nogami's memoir gives several such examples from "Drunken Angel" and "Stray Dog".) He was also involved with several of Japan's outstanding contemporary composers, including <a href="Fumio%20Hayasaka">Fumio Hayasaka</a> (who died in 1955) and the internationally famous <a href="Toru%20Takemitsu">Toru Takemitsu</a>.

Kurosawa employed a number of recurring major themes in his films. These include: (a) the master-disciple relationship between a usually older mentor and one or more novices, which often involves spiritual as well as technical mastery and self-mastery; (b) the heroic champion, the exceptional individual who emerges from the mass of people to produce something or right some injustice; (c) the depiction of extremes of weather as both dramatic devices and symbols of human passion; and (d) the recurrence of cycles of inexorable savage violence within history. According to Stephen Prince, the latter theme began with "Throne of Blood" (1957), and recurred in Kurosawa films of the 1980s. Mr. Prince calls this theme "the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema."

Criticism of Kurosawa in his legacy has significantly followed a close parity between the main currents of domestic criticism his films received when they were released in Japan with the international reception his individual films received when released abroad during his lifetime. Since the early to mid-1950s, a number of critics from the <a href="French%20New%20Wave">French New Wave</a> championed the films of the older Japanese master, <a href="Kenji%20Mizoguchi">Kenji Mizoguchi</a>, at the expense of Kurosawa's work. New Wave critic-filmmaker <a href="Jacques%20Rivette">Jacques Rivette</a>, said: "You can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough ... [Mizoguchi] seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality, that of an individual." According to such French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between "Japanese" Mizoguchi and "Western" Kurosawa by pointing out that "Mizo" had been as influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa, and that this is reflected in his work.

In Japan, there have been critics and other filmmakers who have accused his work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic individuals and groups of men. In her DVD commentary on "Seven Samurai", Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which to her reveal Kurosawa "privileging" these samurai, "support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist ... Kurosawa was hardly a progressive director, they argued, since his peasants could not discover among their own ranks leaders who might rescue the village ... Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. 'I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth ... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.

Owing to Kurosawa's popularity with European and American audiences from the early 1950s onward, he has not escaped the charge of deliberately catering to the tastes of Westerners to achieve or maintain that popularity. Joan Mellen, recording the violently negative reaction (in the 1970s) of the left-wing director <a href="Nagisa%20Oshima">Nagisa Oshima</a> to Kurosawa and his work, states: "That Kurosawa had brought Japanese film to a Western audience meant [to Oshima] that he must be <a href="pandering%20%28politics%29">pandering</a> to Western values and politics." Kurosawa always strongly denied pandering to Western tastes: "He has never catered to a foreign audience" writes Audie Bock, "and has condemned those who do".

Many celebrated directors have been influenced by Kurosawa and have expressed admiration for his work. The filmmakers cited below can be presented according to four categories: (a) those who, like Kurosawa himself, established international critical reputations in the 1950s and early 1960s; (b) the so-called "<a href="New%20Hollywood">New Hollywood</a>" directors, that is, American moviemakers who, for the most part, established their reputations in the early to mid-1970s; (c) other Asian directors; and (d) modern-day directors.
The Swedish director <a href="Ingmar%20Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a> called his own film "<a href="The%20Virgin%20Spring">The Virgin Spring</a>" "touristic, a lousy imitation of Kurosawa", and added, "At that time my admiration for the Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself!" In Italy, <a href="Federico%20Fellini">Federico Fellini</a> in an interview declared the director "the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be"—despite admitting to having seen only one of his films, "Seven Samurai". In France, <a href="Roman%20Polanski">Roman Polanski</a> in 1965 cited Kurosawa as one of his three favorite filmmakers (with Fellini and <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>), singling out "Seven Samurai", "Throne of Blood" and "The Hidden Fortress" for praise. The Italian director <a href="Bernardo%20Bertolucci">Bernardo Bertolucci</a> considered the Japanese master's influence to be seminal: "Kurosawa's movies and "<a href="La%20Dolce%20Vita">La Dolce Vita</a>" of Fellini are the things that pushed me, sucked me into being a film director." <a href="German%20New%20Wave">German New Wave</a> director <a href="Werner%20Herzog">Werner Herzog</a> has cited Kurosawa as one of his greatest influences: "Of the filmmakers with whom I feel some kinship, Griffith ... Buñuel, Kurosawa and Eisenstein's <a href="Ivan%20the%20Terrible%20%28film%29">"Ivan the Terrible"</a>, all come to mind." When asked to list his favorite directors, Russian director <a href="Andrei%20Tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</a> cited Kurosawa as one of his favorites and named "<a href="Seven%20Samurai">Seven Samurai</a>" as one of his ten favorite films.

Kurosawa's New Hollywood admirers have included <a href="Robert%20Altman">Robert Altman</a>, <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>, and <a href="John%20Milius">John Milius</a>. In his early years while still a television director, Robert Altman stated that when he first saw "Rashomon" he was so impressed by its cinematographer's achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun—allegedly it was the first film in which this was done successfully—that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work. It was Coppola who said of Kurosawa, "One thing that distinguishes [him] is that he didn't make one masterpiece or two masterpieces. He made, you know, "eight" masterpieces." Both Spielberg and Scorsese have praised the older man's role as teacher and role model, and Scorsese called him his ""<a href="sensei">sensei</a>"," using the Japanese term. Spielberg has declared, "I have learned more from him than from almost any other filmmaker on the face of the earth", while Scorsese remarked, "Let me say it simply: Akira Kurosawa was my master, and ... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years." Several of these moviemakers were also instrumental in helping Kurosawa obtain financing for his late films: Lucas and Coppola served as co-producers on "Kagemusha", while the Spielberg name, lent to the 1990 production, "Dreams", helped bring that picture to fruition.

As the first Asian filmmaker to achieve international prominence, Kurosawa has naturally served as an inspiration for other Asian "<a href="Auteur%20theory">auteurs</a>". Of "Rashomon", the most famous director of India, <a href="Satyajit%20Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>, said: "The effect of the film on me [upon first seeing it in Calcutta in 1952] was electric. I saw it three times on consecutive days, and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a director's command over every aspect of film making." Other Asian admirers include the Japanese actor and director <a href="Takeshi%20Kitano">Takeshi Kitano</a>, Hong Kong filmmaker <a href="John%20Woo">John Woo</a>, Japanese <a href="anime">anime</a> director <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> and <a href="Mainland%20China">mainland Chinese</a> director <a href="Zhang%20Yimou">Zhang Yimou</a>, who called Kurosawa "the quintessential Asian director".

Even today, Kurosawa continues to inspire and influence contemporary filmmakers. <a href="Alexander%20Payne">Alexander Payne</a> spent the early part of his career watching Kurosawa's films, most notably "<a href="Seven%20Samurai">Seven Samurai</a>" and "<a href="Ikiru">Ikiru</a>". <a href="Guillermo%20del%20Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a> referred to Kurosawa "one of the essential masters", citing "<a href="Throne%20of%20Blood">Throne of Blood</a>", "<a href="High%20and%20Low%20%281963%20film%29">High and Low</a>" and "<a href="Ran%20%28film%29">Ran</a>" as among his favorite films. <a href="Kathryn%20Bigelow">Kathryn Bigelow</a> praised Kurosawa as one of "high-impact filmmakers" who can create emotionally invested characters. <a href="J.J.%20Abrams">J.J. Abrams</a> says he drew from Kurosawa while making . At the age of 19, <a href="Alejandro%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20I%C3%B1%C3%A1rritu">Alejandro González Iñárritu</a> remembers being spellbound when he first saw "<a href="Ikiru">Ikiru</a>" and praises Kurosawa as "one of the first storytelling geniuses who began to change the narrative structure of films." When <a href="Spike%20Lee">Spike Lee</a> posted a list of 87 films every aspiring director should see, he included three Kurosawa movies: "<a href="Rashomon">Rashomon</a>", "<a href="Yojimbo%20%28film%29">Yojimbo</a>" and "<a href="Ran%20%28film%29">Ran</a>".

Following Kurosawa's death, several posthumous works based on his unfilmed screenplays have been produced. "<a href="After%20the%20Rain%20%28film%29">After the Rain</a>", directed by <a href="Takashi%20Koizumi">Takashi Koizumi</a>, was released in 1998, and "The Sea is Watching", directed by <a href="Kei%20Kumai">Kei Kumai</a>, premiered in 2002. A script created by the Yonki no Kai ("Club of the Four Knights") (Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kon Ichikawa), around the time that "Dodeskaden" was made, finally was filmed and released (in 2000) as "Dora-Heita", by the only surviving founding member of the club, Kon Ichikawa. <a href="Huayi%20Brothers">Huayi Brothers</a> Media and CKF Pictures in China announced in 2017 plans to produce a film of Kurosawa's posthumous screenplay of "<a href="The%20Masque%20of%20the%20Red%20Death">The Masque of the Black Death</a>" by <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> for 2020. Patrick Frater writing for "Variety" magazine in May 2017 stated that another two unfinished films by Kurosawa were planned, with "Silvering Spear" to start filming in 2018.

Kurosawa Production Co., established in 1959, continues to oversee many of the aspects of Kurosawa's legacy. The director's son, Hisao Kurosawa, is the current head of the company. Its American subsidiary, Kurosawa Enterprises, is located in Los Angeles. Rights to Kurosawa's works are held by Kurosawa Production and the film studios under which he worked, most notably <a href="Toho">Toho</a>. Kurosawa Production works closely with the Akira Kurosawa Foundation, established in December 2003 and also run by Hisao Kurosawa. The foundation organizes an annual <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa%20Memorial%20Short%20Film%20Competition">short film competition</a> and spearheads Kurosawa-related projects, including a recently shelved one to build a memorial museum for the director.

In 1981, the <a href="Kurosawa%20Film%20Studio">Kurosawa Film Studio</a> was opened in Yokohama; two additional locations have since been launched in Japan. A large collection of archive material, including scanned screenplays, photos and news articles, has been made available through the Akira Kurosawa Digital Archive, a Japanese proprietary website maintained by <a href="Ryukoku%20University">Ryukoku University</a> Digital Archives Research Center in collaboration with Kurosawa Production. <a href="Anaheim%20University">Anaheim University</a>'s Akira Kurosawa School of Film was launched in spring 2009 with the backing of Kurosawa Production. It offers online programs in digital film making, with headquarters in Anaheim and a learning center in Tokyo.

Two film awards have also been named in Kurosawa's honor. The Akira Kurosawa Award for Lifetime Achievement in Film Directing is awarded during the <a href="San%20Francisco%20International%20Film%20Festival">San Francisco International Film Festival</a>, while the Akira Kurosawa Award is given during the <a href="Tokyo%20International%20Film%20Festival">Tokyo International Film Festival</a>. In 1999 he was named "<a href="Asian%20of%20the%20Century">Asian of the Century</a>" in the "Arts, Literature, and Culture" category by "<a href="AsianWeek">AsianWeek</a>" magazine and <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, cited as "one of the [five] people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years". In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Kurosawa's birth in 2010, a project called AK100 was launched in 2008. The AK100 Project aims to "expose young people who are the representatives of the next generation, and all people everywhere, to the light and spirit of Akira Kurosawa and the wonderful world he created."

Anaheim University in cooperation with the Kurosawa Family established the Anaheim University Akira Kurosawa School of Film to offer online and blended learning programs on Akira Kurosawa and filmmaking. The animated <a href="Wes%20Anderson">Wes Anderson</a> film, "<a href="Isle%20of%20Dogs%20%28film%29">Isle of Dogs</a>," is partially inspired by Kurosawa's filming techniques. At the 64th Sydney Film Festival, there was a retrospective of Akira Kurosawa where films of his were screened to remember the great legacy he has created from his work.

A significant number of full-length and short documentaries concerning the life and films of Kurosawa were made during his lifetime and after his death. "<a href="A.K.%20%28film%29">A.K.</a>" was filmed in 1985 and is a French documentary film directed by <a href="Chris%20Marker">Chris Marker</a>. Though it was filmed while Kurosawa was working on "<a href="Ran%20%28film%29">Ran</a>", the film focuses more on Kurosawa's remote but polite personality than on the making of the film. The documentary is sometimes seen as being reflective of Marker's fascination with <a href="Japanese%20culture">Japanese culture</a>, which he also drew on for one of his best-known films, "<a href="Sans%20Soleil">Sans Soleil</a>". The film was screened in the <a href="Un%20Certain%20Regard">Un Certain Regard</a> section at the <a href="1985%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1985 Cannes Film Festival</a>. Other documentaries concerning Kurosawa's life and works produced posthumously include:

Ancient Egypt

Ancient Egypt was a <a href="civilization">civilization</a> of <a href="Ancient%20history">ancient</a> <a href="Northeast%20Africa">Northeastern Africa</a>, concentrated along the lower reaches of the <a href="Nile">Nile River</a> in the place that is now the country <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. It is one of <a href="Cradle%20of%20civilization">six historic civilizations</a> to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed <a href="prehistoric%20Egypt">prehistoric Egypt</a> and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to <a href="conventional%20Egyptian%20chronology">conventional Egyptian chronology</a>) with the political unification of <a href="Upper%20and%20Lower%20Egypt">Upper and Lower Egypt</a> under <a href="Menes">Menes</a> (often identified with <a href="Narmer">Narmer</a>). The <a href="history%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">history of ancient Egypt</a> occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a> of the <a href="Early%20Bronze%20Age">Early Bronze Age</a>, the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> of the <a href="Middle%20Bronze%20Age">Middle Bronze Age</a> and the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a> of the <a href="Late%20Bronze%20Age">Late Bronze Age</a>.

Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a>, during the Ramesside period, where it rivalled the <a href="Hittite%20Empire">Hittite Empire</a>, <a href="Assyrian%20Empire">Assyrian Empire</a> and <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a> <a href="Empire">Empire</a>, after which it entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers, such as the <a href="Canaanites">Canaanites</a>/<a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libyans</a>, the <a href="Nubians">Nubians</a>, the <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>ns, <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>ns, the <a href="History%20of%20Achaemenid%20Egypt">Achaemenid Persians</a>, and the <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ians in the <a href="Third%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Third Intermediate Period</a> and the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Late Period of Egypt</a>. In the aftermath of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>'s death, one of his generals, <a href="Ptolemy%20Soter">Ptolemy Soter</a>, established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This Greek <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> ruled Egypt until 30 BC, when, under <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a>, it fell to the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> and became <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">a Roman province</a>.

The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20agriculture">Nile River valley for agriculture</a>. The predictable <a href="Flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">flooding</a> and controlled <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and <a href="social%20development">social development</a> and culture. With resources to spare, the <a href="administration%20%28government%29">administration</a> sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">writing system</a>, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and <a href="Military%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">a military</a> intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite <a href="Egyptian%20writing">scribes</a>, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">religious beliefs</a>.

The many achievements of the <a href="ancient%20Egyptians">ancient Egyptians</a> include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramids</a>, <a href="Egyptian%20temple">temples</a>, and <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s; a system of <a href="Egyptian%20mathematics">mathematics</a>, a practical and effective <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20medicine">system of medicine</a>, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats, <a href="Egyptian%20faience">Egyptian faience</a> and glass technology, new forms of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20literature">literature</a>, and the <a href="Egyptian%E2%80%93Hittite%20peace%20treaty">earliest known peace treaty</a>, made with the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a>. Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its <a href="Art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">art</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">architecture</a> were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the <a href="Egyptology">scientific investigation</a> of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.

The <a href="Nile">Nile</a> has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history. The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization. <a href="Nomadic">Nomadic</a> <a href="Anatomically%20modern%20human">modern human</a> <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s began living in the Nile valley through the end of the <a href="Pleistocene">Middle Pleistocene</a> some 120,000 years ago. By the late <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.

In Predynastic and <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20%28Egypt%29">Early Dynastic</a> times, the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed <a href="savanna">savanna</a> and traversed by herds of grazing <a href="ungulates">ungulates</a>. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and this is also the period when many animals were first <a href="Domestication">domesticated</a>.

By about <a href="6th%20millennium%20BC">5500 BC</a>, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a>, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the <a href="Badari">Badari</a>, which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, <a href="stone%20tool">stone tool</a>s, and its use of copper.

The Badari was followed by the <a href="Amratian%20culture">Amratian</a> (Naqada I) and <a href="Gerzeh%20culture">Gerzeh</a> (Naqada II) cultures, which brought a number of technological improvements. As early as the Naqada I Period, predynastic Egyptians imported <a href="obsidian">obsidian</a> from <a href="History%20of%20Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, used to shape blades and other objects from <a href="Lithic%20flake">flakes</a>. In Naqada II times, early evidence exists of contact with the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>, particularly <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> and the <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> coast. Over a period of about 1,000 years, the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley. Establishing a power center at <a href="Nekhen">Hierakonpolis</a>, and later at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>, <a href="Naqada%20III">Naqada III</a> leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile</a>. They also traded with <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> to the south, the oases of the <a href="Libyan%20Desert">western desert</a> to the west, and the cultures of the <a href="eastern%20Mediterranean">eastern Mediterranean</a> and <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> to the east. Royal <a href="Nubia%23Prehistory">Nubian</a> burials at <a href="Qustul">Qustul</a> produced artifacts bearing the oldest-known examples of Egyptian dynastic symbols, such as the <a href="Hedjet">white crown</a> of Egypt and falcon.

The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods, reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality <a href="hand%20drill%20%28hieroglyph%29">decorative stone vases</a>, <a href="cosmetic%20palette">cosmetic palette</a>s, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a <a href="ceramic%20glaze">ceramic glaze</a> known as <a href="Egyptian%20faience">faience</a>, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines. During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a> for writing the ancient Egyptian language.

 The Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the early <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian-<a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a> civilisation of <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and of ancient <a href="Elam">Elam</a>. The third-century BC Egyptian priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a> grouped the long line of pharaohs from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today. He chose to begin his official history with the king named "Meni" (or "<a href="Menes">Menes</a>" in Greek) who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper</a> and <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a> (around 3100 BC).

The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have been the pharaoh <a href="Narmer">Narmer</a>, who is depicted wearing <a href="Regalia">royal regalia</a> on the ceremonial "Narmer Palette," in a symbolic act of unification. In the Early Dynastic Period about 3150 BC, the first of the Dynastic pharaohs solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>, from which he could control the <a href="labour%20force">labour force</a> and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a>s to the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. The increasing power and wealth of the pharaohs during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a> tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified pharaoh after his death. The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.

Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>, fueled by the increased <a href="agricultural%20productivity">agricultural productivity</a> and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration. Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the <a href="Giza%20Necropolis">Giza pyramids</a> and <a href="Great%20Sphinx%20of%20Giza">Great Sphinx</a>, were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the <a href="vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">vizier</a>, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve <a href="crop%20yield">crop yield</a>, drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a <a href="Criminal%20law">justice system</a> to maintain peace and order. 

Along with the rising importance of a central administration arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called <a href="nomarch">nomarch</a>s began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with <a href="4.2%20kiloyear%20event">severe droughts</a> between 2200 and 2150 BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.

After Egypt's <a href="central%20government">central government</a> collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes. In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the <a href="optimism">optimism</a> and originality of the period.

Free from their loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and <a href="political%20power">political power</a>. By 2160 BC, rulers in <a href="Herakleopolis">Herakleopolis</a> controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a>, the <a href="Intef%20I">Intef family</a>, took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055 BC the northern Theban forces under <a href="Mentuhotep%20II">Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II</a> finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>.

The pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom restored the country's prosperity and stability, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects. Mentuhotep II and his <a href="Eleventh%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eleventh Dynasty</a> successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier <a href="Amenemhat%20I">Amenemhat I</a>, upon assuming kingship at the beginning of the <a href="Twelfth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth Dynasty</a> around 1985 BC, shifted the nation's capital to the city of <a href="Itjtawy">Itjtawy</a>, located in <a href="Faiyum%20Oasis">Faiyum</a>. From Itjtawy, the pharaohs of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted <a href="land%20reclamation">land reclamation</a> and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> that was rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the "<a href="Walls-of-the-Ruler">Walls-of-the-Ruler</a>", to defend against foreign attack.

With the pharaohs' having secured military and political security and vast agricultural and mineral wealth, the nation's population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in expressions of personal piety and what could be called a <a href="democratization">democratization</a> of the afterlife, in which all people possessed a soul and could be welcomed into the company of the gods after death. Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style. The <a href="relief">relief</a> and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical perfection.

The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, <a href="Amenemhat%20III">Amenemhat III</a>, allowed <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic</a>-speaking <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>ite settlers from the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe <a href="Flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">Nile floods</a> later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>ite settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the <a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a>.

Around 1785 BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a>n people called the <a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a> had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of <a href="Avaris">Avaris</a>, seized control of Egypt, and forced the central government to retreat to Thebes. The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the <a href="composite%20bow">composite bow</a> and the horse-drawn <a href="chariot">chariot</a>.

After their retreat, the native Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos' <a href="Nubian%20people">Nubian</a> allies, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kushites</a>, to the south of Egypt. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555 BC. The pharaohs <a href="Seqenenre%20Tao%20II">Seqenenre Tao II</a> and <a href="Kamose">Kamose</a> were ultimately able to defeat the <a href="Nubians">Nubians</a> to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor, <a href="Ahmose%20I">Ahmose I</a>, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt's borders and attempting to gain mastery of the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>.

The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours, including the <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a> Empire, <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>, and <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>. Military campaigns waged under <a href="Thutmose%20I">Tuthmosis I</a> and his grandson <a href="Thutmose%20III">Tuthmosis III</a> extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Between their reigns, <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> generally promoted peace and restored trade routes lost during the Hyksos occupation, as well as expanding to new regions. When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC, Egypt had an empire extending from <a href="Niya%20%28kingdom%29">Niya</a> in north west <a href="Syria">Syria</a> to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as <a href="bronze">bronze</a> and <a href="wood">wood</a>.

The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god <a href="Amun">Amun</a>, whose growing cult was based in <a href="Karnak">Karnak</a>. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built. The pharaoh <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> used such hyperbole and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty-two years. Her reign was very successful, marked by an extended period of peace and wealth-building, trading expeditions to <a href="Land%20of%20Punt">Punt</a>, restoration of foreign trade networks, and great building projects, including an elegant <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a> that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later, a colossal pair of obelisks, and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Amenhotep II, the heir to Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III, sought to erase her legacy near the end of his father's reign and throughout his, touting many of her accomplishments as his. He also tried to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries, which some suggest was a futile attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom.

Around 1350 BC, the stability of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to <a href="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a>, he touted the previously obscure <a href="Solar%20deity">sun deity</a> <a href="Aten">Aten</a> as the <a href="God">supreme deity</a>, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day <a href="Amarna">Amarna</a>), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> (where the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a>, <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a>, and <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>ns were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>, <a href="Ay">Ay</a>, and <a href="Horemheb">Horemheb</a> worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the <a href="Amarna%20Period">Amarna Period</a>.
Around 1279 BC, <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a>, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history. A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kadesh">Battle of Kadesh</a> (in modern <a href="Syria">Syria</a>) and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty, around 1258 BC. With both the Egyptians and <a href="Hittite%20Empire">Hittite Empire</a> proving unable to gain the upper hand over one another, and both powers also fearful of the expanding <a href="Middle%20Assyrian%20Empire">Middle Assyrian Empire</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> withdrew from much of the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>. The <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> were thus left to compete unsuccessfully with the powerful <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>ns and the newly arrived <a href="Phrygians">Phrygians</a>.

Egypt's wealth, however, made it a tempting target for invasion, particularly by the <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libyan</a> <a href="Berber%20people">Berbers</a> to the west, and the <a href="Sea%20Peoples">Sea Peoples</a>, a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the <a href="Precinct%20of%20Amun-Re">temple of Amun</a> in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.

Following the death of <a href="Ramesses%20XI">Ramesses XI</a> in 1078 BC, <a href="Smendes">Smendes</a> assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt, ruling from the city of <a href="Tanis%2C%20Egypt">Tanis</a>. The south was effectively controlled by the <a href="Theban%20High%20Priests%20of%20Amun">High Priests of Amun at Thebes</a>, who recognized Smendes in name only. During this time, <a href="Berber%20people">Berber</a> tribes from what was later to be called <a href="Libya">Libya</a> had been settling in the western delta, and the chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under <a href="Shoshenq%20I">Shoshenq I</a> in 945 BC, founding the <a href="Libyan">Libyan</a> Berber, or <a href="Bubastite">Bubastite</a>, dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions.

In the mid-ninth century BC, Egypt made a failed attempt to once more gain a foothold in <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a>. <a href="Osorkon%20II">Osorkon II</a> of Egypt, along with a large alliance of nations and peoples, including <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="Hamath">Hamath</a>, <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>/<a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a>, and neo <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> among others, engaged in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Karkar">Battle of Karkar</a> against the powerful <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n king <a href="Shalmaneser%20III">Shalmaneser III</a> in 853 BC. However, this coalition of powers failed and the <a href="Neo%20Assyrian%20Empire">Neo Assyrian Empire</a> continued to dominate Western Asia.

Libyan Berber control began to erode as a rival native dynasty in the delta arose under <a href="Leontopolis">Leontopolis</a>. Also, the <a href="Nubians">Nubians</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kushites</a> threatened Egypt from the lands to the south.

Drawing on millennia of interaction (trade, acculturation, occupation, assimilation, and war) with Egypt, the Kushite king <a href="Piye">Piye</a> left his <a href="Nubian%20people">Nubian</a> capital of <a href="Napata">Napata</a> and invaded <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> around 727 BC. Piye easily seized control of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a> and eventually the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>. He recorded the episode on his stela of victory. Piye set the stage for subsequent <a href="Twenty-fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty-fifth dynasty</a> pharaohs, such as <a href="Taharqa">Taharqa</a>, to reunite the "Two lands" of Northern and Southern Egypt. The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom.

The Twenty-fifth dynasty ushered in a renaissance period for ancient Egypt. Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their glorious Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. Pharaohs, such as Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, <a href="Jebel%20Barkal">Jebel Barkal</a>, etc. It was during the Twenty-fifth dynasty that there was the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>) in the Nile Valley since the Middle Kingdom.

Piye made various unsuccessful attempts to extend Egyptian influence in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>, then controlled by <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>. In 720 BC, he sent an army in support of a rebellion against Assyria, which was taking place in <a href="Philistia">Philistia</a> and <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a>. However, Piye was defeated by <a href="Sargon%20II">Sargon II</a> and the rebellion failed. In 711 BC, <a href="Piye">Piye</a> again supported a revolt against Assyria by the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> of <a href="Ashdod">Ashdod</a> and was once again defeated by the Assyrian king <a href="Sargon%20II">Sargon II</a>. Subsequently, <a href="Piye">Piye</a> was forced from the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>.

From the 10th century BC onwards, Assyria fought for control of the southern Levant. Frequently, cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aid in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army. Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a foothold in the Near East. Taharqa aided the <a href="Judean">Judean</a> King <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a> when Hezekiah and <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was besieged by the Assyrian king, <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a>. Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem. Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to divine intervention to surrender to disease. Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years). Some argue that disease was the primary reason for failing to actually take the city; however, Senacherib's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless.

Sennacherib had been murdered by his own sons for destroying the rebellious city of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, a city sacred to all <a href="Mesopotamians">Mesopotamians</a>, the Assyrians included. In 674 BC <a href="Esarhaddon">Esarhaddon</a> launched a preliminary incursion into Egypt; however, this attempt was repelled by Taharqa. However, in 671 BC, Esarhaddon launched a full-scale invasion. Part of his army stayed behind to deal with rebellions in <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>, and <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. The remainder went south to <a href="Rapihu">Rapihu</a>, then crossed the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai</a>, and entered Egypt. Esarhaddon decisively defeated Taharqa, took <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>, <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a> and all the major cities of Egypt, and Taharqa was chased back to his <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>n homeland. Esarhaddon now called himself "king of Egypt, "Patros", and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kush</a>", and returned with rich booty from the cities of the delta; he erected a <a href="victory%20stele%20of%20Esarhaddon">victory stele</a> at this time, and paraded the captive Prince <a href="Ushankhuru">Ushankhuru</a>, the son of Taharqa in <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a>. Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how "All <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>ns (read <a href="Nubians">Nubians</a>/<a href="Kushites">Kushites</a>) I deported from Egypt, leaving not one left to do homage to me". He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf. The conquest by Esarhaddon effectively marked the end of the short lived <a href="Kushite%20Empire">Kushite Empire</a>.
However, the native Egyptian rulers installed by Esarhaddon were unable to retain full control of the whole country for long. Two years later, Taharqa returned from Nubia and seized control of a section of southern Egypt as far north as <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>. Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa; however, he fell ill and died in his capital, <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a>, before he left Assyria. His successor, <a href="Ashurbanipal">Ashurbanipal</a>, sent an Assyrian general named <a href="Sha-Nabu-shu">Sha-Nabu-shu</a> with a small, but well trained army, which conclusively defeated Taharqa at Memphis and once more drove him from Egypt. Taharqa died in Nubia two years later.

His successor, <a href="Tantamani">Tanutamun</a>, also made a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He successfully defeated <a href="Necho%20I">Necho</a>, the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a> in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani (Tanutamun) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia. The Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered. A native ruler, <a href="Psammetichus%20I">Psammetichus I</a> was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, and the Nubians were never again to pose a threat to either Assyria or Egypt.

With no permanent plans for conquest, the Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s who became known as the Saite kings of the <a href="Twenty-sixth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty-sixth Dynasty</a>. By 653 BC, the Saite king <a href="Psamtik%20I">Psamtik I</a> (taking advantage of the fact that Assyria was involved in a fierce war conquering <a href="Elam">Elam</a> and that few Assyrian troops were stationed in Egypt) was able to free Egypt relatively peacefully from Assyrian vassalage with the help of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>n and <a href="Greece">Greek</a> mercenaries, the latter of whom were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. Psamtik and his successors however were careful to maintain peaceful relations with Assyria. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of <a href="Naucratis">Naukratis</a> became the home of Greeks in the delta.

In 609 BC <a href="Necho%20II">Necho II</a> went to war with <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, the <a href="Chaldean%20people">Chaldeans</a>, the <a href="Medians">Medians</a> and the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> in an attempt to save Assyria, which after a brutal civil war was being overrun by this coalition of powers. However, the attempt to save Egypt's former masters failed. The Egyptians delayed intervening too long, and <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> had already fallen and King <a href="Sin-shar-ishkun">Sin-shar-ishkun</a> was dead by the time Necho II sent his armies northwards. However, Necho easily brushed aside the <a href="Israelite">Israelite</a> army under King <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> but he and the Assyrians then lost a battle at <a href="Harran">Harran</a> to the Babylonians, Medes and Scythians. Necho II and <a href="Ashur-uballit%20II">Ashur-uballit II</a> of Assyria were finally defeated at <a href="Carchemish">Carchemish</a> in <a href="Aramea">Aramea</a> (modern <a href="Syria">Syria</a>) in 605 BC. The Egyptians remained in the area for some decades, struggling with the <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>n kings <a href="Nabopolassar">Nabopolassar</a> and <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a> for control of portions of the former Assyrian Empire in <a href="The%20Levant">The Levant</a>. However, they were eventually driven back into Egypt, and <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a> even briefly invaded <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> itself in 567 BC. The Saite kings based in the new capital of <a href="Sais">Sais</a> witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525 BC, the powerful <a href="Persia">Persia</a>ns, led by <a href="Cambyses%20II%20of%20Persia">Cambyses II</a>, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh <a href="Psamtik%20III">Psamtik III</a> at the battle of <a href="Pelusium">Pelusium</a>. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home of <a href="Susa">Susa</a> in Persia (modern <a href="Iran">Iran</a>), leaving Egypt under the control of a <a href="satrap">satrap</a>y. A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.

Following its annexation by <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, Egypt was joined with <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a> (modern <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>) in the sixth <a href="satrap">satrap</a>y of the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Persian Empire</a>. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the <a href="Twenty-seventh%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty-seventh dynasty</a>, ended after more than one-hundred years in 402 BC, and from 380 to 343 BC the <a href="Thirtieth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Thirtieth Dynasty</a> ruled as the last native royal house of dynastic Egypt, which ended with the kingship of <a href="Nectanebo%20II">Nectanebo II</a>. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the <a href="Thirty-first%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Thirty-first Dynasty</a>, began in 343 BC, but shortly after, in 332 BC, the Persian ruler <a href="Mazaces">Mazaces</a> handed Egypt over to the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">Macedonian</a> ruler <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> without a fight.

In 332 BC, <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> conquered Egypt with little resistance from the <a href="Persia">Persia</a>ns and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">Macedonian</a> <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a>, was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new <a href="Capital%20%28political%29">capital city</a> of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a <a href="Seat%20of%20Wisdom">seat of learning</a> and culture, centered at the famous <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>. The <a href="Lighthouse%20of%20Alexandria">Lighthouse of Alexandria</a> lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.

<a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic culture</a> did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">Egyptian gods</a> were <a href="Syncretic%20religion">syncretized</a> into composite deities, such as <a href="Serapis">Serapis</a>, and <a href="Ancient%20Greek">classical Greek</a> forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of <a href="Ptolemy%20IV%20Philopator">Ptolemy IV</a>. In addition, as <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful <a href="Syriac%20Christians">Syriac</a> opponents from the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.

Egypt became a province of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in 30 BC, following the defeat of <a href="Mark%20Antony">Marc Antony</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic</a> Queen <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra VII</a> by <a href="Augustus">Octavian</a> (later <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Emperor</a> Augustus) in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a>. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the <a href="Roman%20legion">Roman army</a>, under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period. Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.

Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a>.

From the mid-first century AD, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Egyptian Religion</a> and <a href="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out. In 391 the Christian Emperor <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius</a> introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples. Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed. As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak <a href="Egyptian%20language">their language</a>, the ability to read <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphic writing</a> slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to <a href="church%20%28building%29">churches</a> or abandoned to the desert.

The <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a> was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme <a href="Commander">military commander</a> and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the <a href="vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">vizier</a>, who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the <a href="archives">archives</a>. At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called <a href="Nome%20%28Egypt%29">nomes</a> each governed by a <a href="nomarch">nomarch</a>, who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The <a href="Egyptian%20temple">temples</a> formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they <a href="Place%20of%20worship">houses of worship</a>, but were also responsible for collecting and storing the nation's wealth in a system of <a href="granary">granaries</a> and treasuries administered by <a href="Supervisor">overseers</a>, who redistributed grain and goods.

Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use <a href="Currency">coinage</a> until the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late period</a>, they did use a type of money-barter system, with standard sacks of grain and the "<a href="Deben%20%28unit%29">deben</a>", a weight of roughly of copper or silver, forming a common denominator. Workers were paid in grain; a simple laborer might earn 5½ sacks (200 kg or 400 lb) of grain per month, while a foreman might earn 7½ sacks (250 kg or 550 lb). Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140 deben. Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list. During the fifth century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of <a href="precious%20metal">precious metal</a> rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.

Egyptian society was highly stratified, and <a href="social%20status">social status</a> was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or <a href="Nobility">noble family</a> that owned the land. Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a> system. Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, known as the "white kilt class" in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank. The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field. <a href="Slavery">Slavery</a> was known in ancient Egypt, but the extent and prevalence of its practice are unclear.
The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women, including people from all social classes except slaves, as essentially equal under the law, and even the lowliest <a href="peasant">peasant</a> was entitled to petition the <a href="vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">vizier</a> and his court for redress. Although slaves were mostly used as indentured servants, they were able to buy and sell their servitude, work their way to freedom or nobility, and were usually treated by <a href="physician">doctors</a> in the workplace. Both men and women had the right to own and sell property, make contracts, marry and divorce, receive inheritance, and pursue legal disputes in court. Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices and opportunities for achievement. Women such as <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> and <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra VII</a> even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as <a href="God%27s%20Wife%20of%20Amun">Divine Wives of Amun</a>. Despite these freedoms, ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration, served only secondary roles in the temples, and were not as likely to be as educated as men. 

The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as <a href="Ma%27at">Ma'at</a>. Although no <a href="legal%20code">legal code</a>s from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as "Kenbet" in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the "Great Kenbet", over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.

Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, <a href="oracle">oracle</a>s played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a "yes" or "no" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an <a href="ostracon">ostracon</a>.

A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich <a href="fertile%20soil">fertile soil</a> resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. <a href="Land%20management">Land management</a> was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.

Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: "Akhet" (flooding), "Peret" (planting), and "Shemu" (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the <a href="growing%20season">growing season</a> lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used <a href="sickle">sickle</a>s to harvest their crops, which were then <a href="Threshing">threshed</a> with a <a href="flail">flail</a> to separate the straw from the grain. <a href="Winnowing">Winnowing</a> removed the <a href="chaff">chaff</a> from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.

The ancient Egyptians cultivated <a href="emmer">emmer</a> and <a href="barley">barley</a>, and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer. <a href="Flax">Flax</a> plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of <a href="linen">linen</a> and to make clothing. <a href="Papyrus">Papyrus</a> growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.

The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and <a href="animal">animal</a>s was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole. Animals, both <a href="Domestication">domesticated</a> and <a href="Wildlife">wild</a>, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. <a href="Poultry">Poultry</a>, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of <a href="fish">fish</a>. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.

The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and <a href="oxen">oxen</a> as <a href="Working%20animal">beasts of burden</a>, and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that <a href="North%20African%20elephant">elephant</a>s were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of <a href="grazing">grazing</a> land. Dogs, cats, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>n lions, were reserved for royalty. <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses. During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess <a href="Bastet%20%28mythology%29">Bastet</a> and the ibis god <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.

Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These <a href="natural%20resource">natural resource</a>s allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and <a href="fashion%20jewelry">fashion jewelry</a>. <a href="Embalming">Embalmers</a> used salts from the <a href="Wadi%20El%20Natrun">Wadi Natrun</a> for <a href="mummy">mummification</a>, which also provided the <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> needed to make plaster. Ore-bearing <a href="rock%20formation">rock formation</a>s were found in distant, inhospitable <a href="wadi">wadi</a>s in the <a href="Arabian%20Desert">eastern desert</a> and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive <a href="Gold%20mining">gold mines</a> in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The <a href="Wadi%20Hammamat">Wadi Hammamat</a> was a notable source of granite, <a href="greywacke">greywacke</a>, and gold. <a href="Flint">Flint</a> was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose. Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> as cosmetic substances.

The Egyptians worked deposits of the <a href="Lead">lead ore</a> <a href="galena">galena</a> at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from <a href="malachite">malachite</a> ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in <a href="Alluvium">alluvial deposits</a>, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as <a href="Porphyry%20%28geology%29">porphyry</a>, greywacke, <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a>, and <a href="carnelian">carnelian</a> dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked deposits of <a href="emerald">emerald</a>s in Wadi Sikait and <a href="amethyst">amethyst</a> in Wadi el-Hudi.

The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their <a href="Foreign%20contacts%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">foreign neighbors</a> to obtain rare, exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the <a href="Predynastic%20Egypt">Predynastic Period</a>, they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs. An Egyptian <a href="colony">colony</a> stationed in southern <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> dates to slightly before the First Dynasty. <a href="Narmer">Narmer</a> had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian trade with <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with <a href="Land%20of%20Punt">Punt</a> provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons. Egypt relied on trade with <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>, which had to be imported from far-away <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included <a href="ancient%20Greece">Greece</a> and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of <a href="olive%20oil">olive oil</a>. In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.

The <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a> is a northern <a href="Afro-Asiatic%20languages">Afro-Asiatic</a> language closely related to the <a href="Berber%20languages">Berber</a> and <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic languages</a>. It has the second longest history of any language (after <a href="Sumerian%20language">Sumerian</a>), having been written from c. 3200 BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are <a href="Old%20Egyptian">Old Egyptian</a>, <a href="Middle%20Egyptian">Middle Egyptian</a> (Classical Egyptian), <a href="Late%20Egyptian">Late Egyptian</a>, <a href="Demotic%20%28Egyptian%29">Demotic</a> and <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a>. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.

Ancient Egyptian was a <a href="synthetic%20language">synthetic language</a>, but it became more <a href="Analytic%20language">analytic</a> later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite <a href="Article%20%28grammar%29">articles</a>, which replaced the older inflectional <a href="suffix">suffix</a>es. There was a change from the older <a href="verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object">verb–subject–object</a> <a href="word%20order">word order</a> to <a href="subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">subject–verb–object</a>. The Egyptian <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphic</a>, <a href="hieratic">hieratic</a>, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic <a href="Coptic%20alphabet">Coptic alphabet</a>. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Egyptian Orthodox Church</a>, and traces of it are found in modern <a href="Egyptian%20Arabic">Egyptian Arabic</a>.

Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include <a href="pharyngeal%20consonant">pharyngeal</a> and <a href="Emphatic%20consonant">emphatic</a> consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless <a href="Fricative%20consonant">fricatives</a> and voiced and voiceless <a href="Affricate%20consonant">affricates</a>. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Later Egyptian to about nine. The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a <a href="Semitic%20root">triliteral</a> or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the <a href="Grammatical%20person">person</a>. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is ', 'he hears'. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb: ', 'the woman hears'.

Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call "<a href="Arabic%20grammar">nisbation</a>" because of its similarity with Arabic. The word order is in verbal and adjectival sentences, and in nominal and adverbial sentences. The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun. Verbs and nouns are negated by the <a href="Grammatical%20particle">particle</a> "n", but "nn" is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. <a href="Stress%20%28linguistics%29">Stress</a> falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).

<a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">Hieroglyphic writing</a> dates from c. 3000 BC, and is composed of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called <a href="hieratic">hieratic</a>, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, <a href="Demotic%20%28Egyptian%29">Demotic</a>, became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.

Around the first century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> with the addition of some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by <a href="Thomas%20Young%20%28scientist%29">Thomas Young</a> and <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Champollion">Jean-François Champollion</a>, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.

Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the "Per Ankh" institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories. Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the <a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid</a> and <a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a>, were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300 BC. Later Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in <a href="Ramesside%20Period">Ramesside</a> administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of <a href="Harkhuf">Harkhuf</a> and <a href="Weni%20the%20Elder">Weni</a>. The genre known as "<a href="Sebayt">Sebayt</a>" ("instructions") was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the <a href="Ipuwer%20Papyrus">Ipuwer papyrus</a>, a poem of lamentations describing <a href="natural%20disaster">natural disaster</a>s and social upheaval, is a famous example.

The <a href="Story%20of%20Sinuhe">Story of Sinuhe</a>, written in <a href="Middle%20Egyptian">Middle Egyptian</a>, might be the classic of Egyptian literature. Also written at this time was the <a href="Westcar%20Papyrus">Westcar Papyrus</a>, a set of stories told to <a href="Khufu">Khufu</a> by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests. The <a href="Instruction%20of%20Amenemope">Instruction of Amenemope</a> is considered a masterpiece of near-eastern literature. Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the <a href="Late%20Egyptian">vernacular language</a> was more often employed to write popular pieces like the <a href="Story%20of%20Wenamun">Story of Wenamun</a> and the <a href="Instruction%20of%20Any">Instruction of Any</a>. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700 BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the <a href="Demotic%20%28Egyptian%29">demotic</a> script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the <a href="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a>.

Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of <a href="Mudbrick">mud-brick</a> designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.

The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from <a href="animal%20fat">animal fat</a> and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and <a href="Beauty%20and%20Cosmetics%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt">cosmetics</a>. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's <a href="income">income</a>.

Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported <a href="lute">lute</a>s and <a href="lyre">lyre</a>s from Asia. The <a href="sistrum">sistrum</a> was a rattle-like <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a> that was especially important in religious ceremonies.

The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities, including games and music. <a href="Senet">Senet</a>, a board game where pieces moved according to random chance, was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was <a href="mehen%20%28game%29">mehen</a>, which had a circular gaming board. Juggling and <a href="ball%20game">ball game</a>s were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at <a href="Beni%20Hasan">Beni Hasan</a>. The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting and boating as well.

The excavation of the workers' village of <a href="Deir%20el-Madinah">Deir el-Madinah</a> has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organization, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community were studied in such detail.

Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time; indeed, the <a href="Egyptian%20cuisine">cuisine of modern Egypt</a> retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.

The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world: the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Great Pyramids of Giza</a> and the <a href="Karnak">temples at Thebes</a>. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large <a href="stone%20structures">stone structures</a> with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today.

The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, such as those in <a href="Malkata">Malkata</a> and <a href="Amarna">Amarna</a>, show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs. Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mud bricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, <a href="Djoser">Djoser</a>'s mortuary complex, include <a href="post%20and%20lintel">post and lintel</a> supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.

The earliest preserved ancient <a href="Egyptian%20temples">Egyptian temples</a>, such as those at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the <a href="pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a>, the open <a href="courtyard">courtyard</a>, and the enclosed <a href="hypostyle">hypostyle</a> hall to the front of the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Greco-Roman period. The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a>, a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground <a href="Chamber%20tomb">burial chamber</a>. The <a href="step%20pyramid">step pyramid</a> of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs. The Twenty-fifth dynasty was a notable exception, as all Twenty-fifth dynasty pharaohs constructed pyramids.

The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change. These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The <a href="Narmer%20Palette">Narmer Palette</a>, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs. Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.
Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone to carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with <a href="gum%20arabic">gum arabic</a> as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.

Pharaohs used <a href="relief">relief</a>s to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of <a href="funerary%20art">funerary art</a>, such as <a href="Ushabti">shabti</a> statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife. During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats, and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.

Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a>-style frescoes were found in <a href="Avaris">Avaris</a>. The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to <a href="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a>'s revolutionary religious ideas. This style, known as <a href="Amarna%20art">Amarna art</a>, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.

Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the <a href="Divine%20Right%20of%20Kings">divine right of kings</a>. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by <a href="Egyptian%20pantheon">gods</a> who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">myths</a> and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.

Gods were worshiped in cult <a href="Egyptian%20temple">temples</a> administered by priests acting on the king's behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos. After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of <a href="oracle">oracle</a>s to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.

The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or "aspects". In addition to the body, each person had a "šwt" (shadow), a "ba" (personality or soul), a "ka" (life-force), and a "name". The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his "ka" and "ba" and become one of the "blessed dead", living on as an "akh", or "effective one". For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a <a href="Maat%23Maat%20and%20the%20Afterlife">"feather of truth"</a>. If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.

The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by <a href="Mummy">mummification</a>, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife. Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by <a href="desiccation">desiccation</a>. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the <a href="Organ%20%28anatomy%29">internal organs</a>, wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in <a href="canopic%20jar">canopic jar</a>s.

By the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called <a href="natron">natron</a>. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted <a href="cartonnage">cartonnage</a> mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.

Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. Beginning in the New Kingdom, <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Dead">books of the dead</a> were included in the grave, along with <a href="Ushabti">shabti</a> statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife. Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.

The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypt's domination in the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a>. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of <a href="Buhen">Buhen</a> on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kush</a> and parts of the Levant.

Typical military equipment included <a href="Bow%20%28weapon%29">bows and arrows</a>, spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching <a href="Leather">animal skin</a> over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using <a href="Chariotry%20in%20ancient%20Egypt">chariots</a> that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the <a href="Khopesh">Khopesh</a> was adopted from Asiatic soldiers. The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army; it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as <a href="Seqenenre%20Tao%20II">Seqenenre Tao II</a> and his sons, did do so. However, it has also been argued that "kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops." Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.

In technology, medicine, and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a>, as evidenced by the <a href="Edwin%20Smith%20Papyrus">Edwin Smith</a> and <a href="Ebers%20Papyrus">Ebers papyri</a> (c. 1600 BC), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and <a href="decimal">decimal system</a>.
Even before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as <a href="Egyptian%20faience">faience</a>, which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of <a href="Silicon%20dioxide">silica</a>, small amounts of <a href="Calcium%20oxide">lime</a> and <a href="Sodium%20oxide">soda</a>, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as <a href="Egyptian%20blue">Egyptian Blue</a>, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or <a href="sintering">sintering</a>) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.

The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding <a href="Micromineral">trace elements</a> to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.

The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and debilitating <a href="schistosomiasis">schistosomiasis</a> parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to <a href="abscess">abscess</a>es (though <a href="dental%20caries">caries</a> were rare).

The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted <a href="Periodontitis">periodontal disease</a>. Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence. Adult <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.

Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, such as <a href="Imhotep">Imhotep</a>, remained famous long after their deaths. <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists. Training of physicians took place at the "Per Ankh" or "House of Life" institution, most notably those headquartered in <a href="Bubastis">Per-Bastet</a> during the New Kingdom and at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a> and <a href="Sais%2C%20Egypt">Saïs</a> in the Late period. <a href="Medical%20papyri">Medical papyri</a> show <a href="Empirical%20evidence">empirical knowledge</a> of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.

Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while <a href="opium">opium</a> <a href="thyme">thyme</a> and <a href="Atropa%20belladonna">belladona</a> were used to relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers were made to the goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve <a href="asthma">asthma</a> symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set <a href="broken%20bones">broken bones</a>, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.

Early <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> knew how to assemble planks of wood into a <a href="hull%20%28ship%29">ship hull</a> and had mastered advanced forms of <a href="shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a> as early as 3000 BC. The <a href="Archaeological%20Institute%20of%20America">Archaeological Institute of America</a> reports that the oldest <a href="Plank%20%28wood%29">planked</a> <a href="ship">ship</a>s known are the <a href="Abydos%20boats">Abydos boats</a>. A group of 14 discovered ships in <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a> were constructed of wooden planks "sewn" together. Discovered by Egyptologist David O'Connor of <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, woven <a href="strap">strap</a>s were found to have been used to lash the planks together, and <a href="Cyperus%20papyrus">reeds</a> or <a href="Poaceae">grass</a> stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams. Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to <a href="Khasekhemwy">Pharaoh Khasekhemwy</a>, originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC, and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating. The ship dating to 3000 BC was long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh. According to professor O'Connor, the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to <a href="Hor-Aha">Pharaoh Aha</a>.

Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with <a href="treenail">treenail</a>s to fasten them together, using <a href="Pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a> for <a href="caulking">caulking</a> the seams. The "<a href="Khufu%20ship">Khufu ship</a>", a vessel sealed into a pit in the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Giza pyramid complex</a> at the foot of the <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a> in the <a href="Fourth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fourth Dynasty</a> around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a <a href="solar%20barque">solar barque</a>. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with <a href="mortise%20and%20tenon">mortise and tenon</a> joints.

Large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean, especially <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> (on the coast of modern-day Lebanon), and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the <a href="Land%20of%20Punt">Land of Punt</a>. In fact one of the earliest Egyptian words for a seagoing ship is a "Byblos Ship", which originally defined a class of Egyptian seagoing ships used on the Byblos run; however, by the end of the Old Kingdom, the term had come to include large seagoing ships, whatever their destination.

In 2011 archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt excavating a dried-up lagoon known as <a href="Mersa%20Gawasis">Mersa Gawasis</a> have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a>'s Punt expedition onto the open ocean. Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes, made from papyrus, coiled in huge bundles. And in 2013 a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the world's oldest port, dating back about 4500 years, from the time of King <a href="Cheops">Cheops</a> on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of <a href="Suez">Suez</a>).

In 1977, an ancient north-south canal dating to the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom of Egypt</a> was discovered extending from <a href="Lake%20Timsah">Lake Timsah</a> to the Ballah Lakes. It was dated to the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom of Egypt</a> by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course.

The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic <a href="Naqada">Naqada</a> period, and show a fully developed <a href="numeral%20system">numeral system</a>. The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain. Texts such as the <a href="Rhind%20Mathematical%20Papyrus">Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</a> and the <a href="Moscow%20Mathematical%20Papyrus">Moscow Mathematical Papyrus</a> show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles. They understood basic concepts of <a href="algebra">algebra</a> and <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, and could solve simple sets of <a href="simultaneous%20equations">simultaneous equations</a>.

<a href="Mathematical%20notation">Mathematical notation</a> was decimal, and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write <a href="Egyptian%20fraction">fractions</a> as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction "two-fifths" into the sum of "one-third" + "one-fifteenth". Standard tables of values facilitated this. Some <a href="Vulgar%20fraction">common fractions</a>, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.

Ancient Egyptian mathematicians had a grasp of the principles underlying the <a href="Pythagorean%20theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>, knowing, for example, that a triangle had a right angle opposite the <a href="hypotenuse">hypotenuse</a> when its sides were in a 3–4–5 ratio. They were able to estimate the area of a <a href="circle">circle</a> by subtracting one-ninth from its diameter and squaring the result:

a reasonable approximation of the formula <a href="Pi">π</a>"r".

The <a href="golden%20ratio">golden ratio</a> seems to be reflected in many Egyptian constructions, including the <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramids</a>, but its use may have been an unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony.

Greek historian <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> claimed that ancient Egyptians looked like the people in <a href="Colchis">Colchis</a> (modern-day <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>). This claim has been largely discredited as fictional by modern-day scholars.
For the fact is as I soon came to realise myself, and then heard from others later, that the Colchians are obviously Egyptian. When the notion occurred to me, I asked both the Colchians and the Egyptians about it, and found that the Colchians had better recall of the Egyptians than the Egyptians did of them. Some Egyptians said that they thought the Colchians originated with <a href="Sesostris">Sesostris</a>’ army, but I myself guessed their Egyptian origin not only because the Colchians are dark-skinned and curly-haired (which does not count for much by itself, because these features are common in others too) but more importantly because Colchians, Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only peoples in the world who practise circumcision and who have always done so.
A team lead by <a href="Johannes%20Krause">Johannes Krause</a> managed the first reliable sequencing of the genomes of 90 mummified individuals in 2017. Whilst not conclusive, because of the non-exhaustive time frame and restricted location that the mummies represent, their study nevertheless showed that these ancient Egyptians "closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern populations, especially those in the Levant, and had almost no DNA from sub-Saharan Africa. What's more, the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powers—including Nubians, Greeks, and Romans—conquered the empire." Later, however, something did alter the genomes of Egyptians. Some 15% to 20% of modern Egyptians’ DNA reflects sub-Saharan ancestry, but the ancient mummies had only 6-15% sub-Saharan DNA. 

The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess <a href="Isis">Isis</a>, for example, became popular in the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome. The Romans also imported <a href="building%20material">building material</a>s from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, and <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as <a href="Dhul-Nun%20al-Misri">Dhul-Nun al-Misri</a> and <a href="al-Maqrizi">al-Maqrizi</a>. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of <a href="Egyptomania">Egyptomania</a> across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.

Although the European <a href="colonialism">colonial</a> occupation of Egypt destroyed a significant portion of the country's historical legacy, some foreigners left more positive marks. <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, for example, arranged the first studies in <a href="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a>, which was published in the "<a href="Description%20de%20l%27%C3%89gypte">Description de l'Égypte</a>".

In the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. The <a href="Supreme%20Council%20of%20Antiquities">Supreme Council of Antiquities</a> now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure. The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt.

Motor neuron disease

A motor neuron disease (MND) is any of several <a href="neurological%20disorder">neurological disorder</a>s that selectively affect <a href="motor%20neuron">motor neuron</a>s, the cells that control <a href="voluntary%20muscles">voluntary muscles</a> of the body.

They are <a href="neurodegenerative">neurodegenerative</a> in nature and cause increasing disability and eventually, death.

In the United States, the term is often used to denote ALS, the most common disorder in the group. In the United Kingdom, the term is also spelt "motor neurone disease" (MND) and is sometimes used for the entire group; but mostly it refers to ALS.

While MND refers to a specific subset of similar diseases, there are numerous other diseases of <a href="motor%20neuron">motor neuron</a>s that are referred to collectively as "motor neuron disorders", for instance disease belonging to <a href="spinal%20muscular%20atrophies">spinal muscular atrophies</a>. However, they are not classified as "motor neuron diseases" by the <a href="ICD-10">tenth International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</a> (ICD-10), which is the definition followed in this article.

<doc id="877" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=877" title="Abjad">
Abjad

An abjad (pronounced or ) is a type of <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a> where each symbol stands for a <a href="consonant">consonant</a>, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate <a href="vowel">vowel</a>. The name "abjad" is based on the old <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> alphabet's first four letters – a, b, j, d – to replace the common terms "consonantary", "consonantal alphabet" or "<a href="syllabary">syllabary</a>" to refer to the family of scripts called <a href="West%20Semitic%20languages">West Semitic</a>.

The name "abjad" (' ) is derived from pronouncing the first letters of the "Arabic" alphabet in order. The ordering (') of <a href="Arabic%20letters">Arabic letters</a> used to match that of the older <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician</a> and <a href="Semitic%20alphabet">Semitic</a> alphabets; "".

According to the formulations of Daniels, abjads differ from <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>s in that only consonants, not vowels, are represented among the basic <a href="grapheme">grapheme</a>s. Abjads differ from <a href="abugida">abugida</a>s, another category defined by Daniels, in that in abjads, the vowel sound is "implied" by <a href="phonology">phonology</a>, and where <a href="Diacritic">vowel marks</a> exist for the system, such as <a href="niqqud">nikkud</a> for <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> and <a href="harakat">ḥarakāt</a> for <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, their use is optional and not the dominant (or literate) form. Abugidas mark the vowels (other than the "inherent" vowel) with a <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>, a minor attachment to the letter, or a standalone <a href="glyph">glyph</a>. Some abugidas use a special symbol to "suppress" the <a href="inherent%20vowel">inherent vowel</a> so that the consonant alone can be properly represented. In a <a href="syllabary">syllabary</a>, a grapheme denotes a complete syllable, that is, either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds.

The antagonism of abjad versus alphabet, as it was formulated by Daniels, has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as a term not only for the Arabic numeral system but, which is most important in terms of historical grammatology, also as term for the alphabetic device (i.e. letter order) of ancient Northwest Semitic scripts in opposition to the 'south Arabian' order. This caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in (ancient) Semitic philology. Also, it suggests that consonantal alphabets, in opposition to for instance the Greek alphabet, were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete, lacking something important to be a fully working script system. It has also been objected that, as a set of letters, an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in a language from a phonemic or even phonological point of view, rather, it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from a semantic point of view.

The first abjad to gain widespread usage was the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician abjad</a>. Unlike other contemporary scripts, such as <a href="Cuneiform%20script">cuneiform</a> and <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>, the Phoenician script consisted of only a few dozen symbols. This made the script easy to learn, and seafaring Phoenician merchants took the script wherever they went.

The Phoenician abjad was a radical simplification of phonetic writing, since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick a hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically, much as "<a href="Man%27y%C5%8Dgana">man'yougana</a>" (<a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese characters</a>, or <a href="kanji">kanji</a>, used solely for phonetic use) was used to represent <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> phonetically before the invention of <a href="kana">kana</a>.

Phoenician gave rise to a number of new writing systems, including the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> and <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic</a>, a widely used abjad. The Greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets, such as <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin</a> and <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a>, while Aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of Asia.

Impure abjads have characters for some vowels, optional vowel diacritics, or both. The term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators. However, most modern abjads, such as <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic</a> and <a href="Pahlavi%20alphabet">Pahlavi</a>, are "impure" abjads, that is, they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes, although the said non-diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants, particularly <a href="Approximant%20consonant">approximants</a> that sound similar to long vowels. An example of a "pure" abjad is (perhaps) very early forms of ancient <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician</a>, though at some point (at least by the 9th century BC) it and most of the contemporary Semitic abjads had begun to overload a few of the consonant symbols with a secondary function as vowel markers, called "<a href="mater%20lectionis">matres lectionis</a>". This practice was at first rare and limited in scope, but it became increasingly common and more developed in later times.

In the 9th century BC, the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script for use in their own language. The phonetic structure of the Greek language created too many ambiguities when the vowels went unrepresented, so the script was modified. They did not need letters for the <a href="guttural%20consonant">guttural</a> sounds represented by "<a href="aleph">aleph</a>", "<a href="he%20%28letter%29">he</a>", "<a href="Heth%20%28letter%29">heth</a>" or "<a href="ayin">ayin</a>", so these symbols were assigned vocalic values. The letters "<a href="Waw%20%28letter%29">waw</a>" and "<a href="Yodh">yod</a>" were also adapted into vowel signs; along with "he", these were already used as "matres lectionis" in Phoenician. The major innovation of Greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants (as opposed to syllabaries such as <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> which usually have vowel symbols but cannot combine them with consonants to form arbitrary syllables).

<a href="Abugida">Abugida</a>s developed along a slightly different route. The basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent "a" vowel sound. Hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel. In this way, the <a href="South%20Arabian%20alphabet">South Arabian alphabet</a> evolved into the <a href="Ge%27ez%20alphabet">Ge'ez alphabet</a> between the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD. Similarly, around the 3rd century BC, the <a href="Br%C4%81hm%C4%AB%20script">Brāhmī script</a> developed (from the <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic abjad</a>, it has been hypothesized).

The other major family of abugidas, <a href="Canadian%20Aboriginal%20syllabics">Canadian Aboriginal syllabics</a>, was initially developed in the 1840s by missionary and linguist <a href="James%20Evans%20%28linguist%29">James Evans</a> for the Cree and Ojibwe languages. Evans used features of <a href="Devanagari%20script">Devanagari script</a> and <a href="Pitman%20shorthand">Pitman shorthand</a> to create his initial abugida. Later in the 19th century, other missionaries adapted Evans' system to other Canadian aboriginal languages. Canadian syllabics differ from other abugidas in that the vowel is indicated by rotation of the consonantal symbol, with each vowel having a consistent orientation.

The abjad form of writing is well-adapted to the <a href="morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphological</a> structure of the Semitic languages it was developed to write. This is because words in Semitic languages are formed from <a href="triliteral">a root consisting of (usually) three consonants</a>, the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms. For instance, according to <a href="Classical%20Arabic">Classical Arabic</a> and <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a>, from the Arabic root "Dh-B-Ḥ" (to slaughter) can be derived the forms ' (he slaughtered), ' (you (masculine singular) slaughtered), ' (he slaughters), and ' (slaughterhouse). In most cases, the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer, allowing readers to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from familiar roots (especially in conjunction with <a href="context%20%28language%20use%29">context</a> clues) and improving word recognition while reading for practiced readers.

Abugida

An abugida (from <a href="Ge%27ez%20language">Ge'ez</a>: አቡጊዳ "’abugida"), or alphasyllabary, also known as avugida, is a <a href="Writing%20systems%23Segmental%20writing%20system">segmental writing system</a> in which consonant–vowel sequences are written as a unit: each unit is based on a <a href="consonant">consonant</a> letter, and <a href="vowel">vowel</a> notation is secondary. This contrasts with a full <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>, in which vowels have status equal to consonants, and with an <a href="abjad">abjad</a>, in which vowel marking is absent, <a href="Abjad%23Impure%20abjads">partial</a>, or optional. (In less formal contexts, all three types of script may be termed alphabets.) The terms also contrast them with a <a href="syllabary">syllabary</a>, in which the symbols cannot be split into separate consonants and vowels. Abugidas include the extensive <a href="Brahmic%20family%20of%20scripts">Brahmic family of scripts</a> of South and Southeast Asia, <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic</a> <a href="Ethiopic%20script">Ethiopic script</a>s, and <a href="Canadian%20Aboriginal%20syllabics">Canadian Aboriginal syllabics</a> (which are themselves based in part on Brahmic scripts).

As is the case for syllabaries, the units of the writing system may consist of the representations both of syllables and of consonants. For scripts of the Brahmic family, the term "<a href="Aksara">akshara</a>" is used for the units.

"Abugida" as a term in linguistics was proposed by <a href="Peter%20T.%20Daniels">Peter T. Daniels</a> in his 1990 <a href="Linguistic%20typology">typology</a> of <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a>s. "’Äbugida" is an Ethiopian name for the <a href="Ge%27ez%20alphabet">Ge‘ez script</a>, taken from four letters of that script, "ä bu gi da", in much the same way that "<a href="abecedary">abecedary</a>" is derived from Latin "a be ce de", "<a href="abjad">abjad</a>" is derived from the <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> "a b j d", and "<a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>" is derived from the names of the two first letters in the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, "alpha" and "beta". As Daniels used the word, an abugida is in contrast with a <a href="syllabary">syllabary</a>, where letters with shared consonants or vowels show no particular resemblance to one another, and also with an <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a> proper, where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels. The term "alphasyllabary" was suggested for the Indic scripts in 1997 by <a href="William%20Bright">William Bright</a>, following South Asian linguistic usage, to convey the idea that "they share features of both alphabet and syllabary."

Abugidas were long considered to be syllabaries, or intermediate between syllabaries and alphabets, and the term "syllabics" is retained in the name of <a href="Canadian%20Aboriginal%20Syllabics">Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics</a>. Other terms that have been used include "neosyllabary" (<a href="James-Germain%20F%C3%A9vrier">Février</a> 1959), "pseudo-alphabet" (<a href="Fred%20Householder">Householder</a> 1959), "semisyllabary" (<a href="David%20Diringer">Diringer</a> 1968; a word that has <a href="semi-syllabary">other uses</a>) and "syllabic alphabet" (<a href="Florian%20Coulmas">Coulmas</a> 1996; this term is also a synonym for <a href="syllabary">syllabary</a>).

The formal definitions given by Daniels and Bright for abugida and alphasyllabary differ; some writing systems are abugidas but not alphasyllabaries, and some are alphasyllabaries but not abugidas. An abugida is defined as "a type of writing system whose basic characters denotes consonants followed by a particular vowel, and in which diacritics denote other vowels". (This 'particular vowel' is referred to as the "inherent" or "implicit" vowel, as opposed to the "explicit" vowels marked by the 'diacritics'.) An alphasyllabary is defined as "a type of writing system in which the vowels are denoted by subsidiary symbols not all of which occur in a linear order (with relation to the consonant symbols) that is congruent with their temporal order in speech". Bright did not require that an alphabet explicitly represent all vowels. <a href="%23Phagspa">Phagspa</a> is an example of an abugida that is not an alphasyllabary, and modern <a href="Lao%20alphabet">Lao</a> is an example of an alphasyllabary that is not an abugida, for its vowels are always explicit.

This description is expressed in terms of an abugida. Formally, an alphasyllabary that is not an abugida can be converted to an abugida by adding a purely formal vowel sound that is never used and declaring that to be the inherent vowel of the letters representing consonants. This may formally make the system ambiguous, but in 'practice' this is not a problem, for then the interpretation with the never used inherent vowel sound will always be a wrong interpretation. Note that the actual pronunciation may be complicated by interactions between the sounds apparently written just as the sounds of the letters in the English words "wan, gem" and "war" are affected by neighbouring letters.

The fundamental principles of an abugida apply to words made up of consonant-vowel (CV) syllables. The syllables are written as a linear sequences of the units of the script. Each syllable is either a letter that represents the sound of a consonant and the inherent vowel, or a letter with a modification to indicate the vowel, either by means of <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>s, or by changes in the form of the letter itself. If all modifications are by diacritics and all diacritics follow the direction of the writing of the letters, then the abugida is not an alphasyllabary.

However, most languages have words that are more complicated than a sequence of CV syllables, even ignoring tone.

The first complication is syllables that consist of just a vowel (V). Now, in some languages, this issue does not arise, for every syllable starts with a consonant. This is common in Semitic languages and in languages of mainland SE Asia, and for such languages this issue need not arise. For some languages, a <a href="zero%20consonant">zero consonant</a> letter is used as though every syllable began with a consonant. For other languages, each vowel has a separate letter that is used for each syllable consisting of just the vowel. These letters are known as "independent vowels", and are found in most Indic scripts. These letters may be quite different to the corresponding diacritics, which by contrast are known as "dependent vowels". As a result of the spread of writing systems, independent vowels may be used to represent syllables beginning with a glottal stop, even for non-initial syllables.

The next two complications are sequences of consonants before a vowel (CCV) and syllables ending in a consonant (CVC). The simplest solution, which is not always available, is to break with the principle of writing words as a sequence of syllables and use a unit representing just a consonant (C). This unit may be represented with:

In a true abugida, the lack of distinctive marking may result from the diachronic loss of the inherent vowel, e.g. by <a href="syncope%20%28phonology%29">syncope</a> and <a href="apocope">apocope</a> <a href="Schwa%20deletion%20in%20Indo-Aryan%20languages">in Hindi</a>.

When not handled by decomposition into C + CV, CCV syllables are handled by combining the two consonants. In the Indic scripts, the earliest method was simply to arrange them vertically, but the two consonants may merge as a <a href="Typographic%20ligature">conjunct consonant</a> letters, where two or more letters are graphically joined in a <a href="Typographic%20ligature">ligature</a>, or otherwise change their shapes. Rarely, one of the consonants may be replaced by a gemination mark, e.g. the <a href="Gurmukhi">Gurmukhi</a> "". When they are arranged vertically, as in <a href="Burmese%20alphabet">Burmese</a> or <a href="Khmer%20alphabet">Khmer</a>, they are said to be 'stacked'. Often there has been a change to writing the two consonants side by side. In the latter case, the fact of combination may be indicated by a diacritic on one of the consonants or a change in the form of one of the consonants, e.g. the <a href="Devanagari%23Conjuncts">half forms</a> of Devanagari. Generally, the reading order is top to bottom or the general reading order of the script, but sometimes the order is reversed.

The division of a word into syllables for the purposes of writing does not always accord with the natural phonetics of the language. For example, Brahmic scripts commonly handle a phonetic sequence CVC-CV as CV-CCV or CV-C-CV. However, sometimes phonetic CVC syllables are handled as single units, and the final consonant may be represented:


More complicated unit structures (e.g. CC or CCVC) are handled by combining the various techniques above.

There are three principal families of abugidas, depending on whether vowels are indicated by modifying consonants by "diacritics, distortion," or "orientation."

<a href="T%C4%81na">Tāna</a> of the <a href="Maldives">Maldives</a> has dependent vowels and a zero vowel sign, but no inherent vowel.

Indic scripts originated in <a href="India">India</a> and spread to <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. All surviving Indic scripts are descendants of the <a href="Brahmi%20alphabet">Brahmi alphabet</a>. Today they are used in most languages of <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a> (although replaced by <a href="Perso-Arabic">Perso-Arabic</a> in <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, <a href="Kashmiri%20language">Kashmiri</a> and some other languages of <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="India">India</a>), mainland <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> (<a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="Laos">Laos</a>, and <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>), and <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>n archipelago (<a href="Javanese%20script">Javanese</a>, <a href="Balinese%20script">Balinese</a>, <a href="Sundanese%20script">Sundanese</a>, etc.). The primary division is into North Indic scripts used in Northern India, Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, and Southern Indic scripts used in <a href="South%20India">South India</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>.
South Indic letter forms are very rounded; North Indic less so, though <a href="Odia%20script">Odia</a>, <a href="Golmol%20script">Golmol</a> and <a href="Litumol">Litumol</a> of Nepal script are rounded.
Most North Indic scripts' full letters incorporate a horizontal line at the top, with <a href="Gujarati%20script">Gujarati</a> and Odia as exceptions; South Indic scripts do not.

Indic scripts indicate vowels through dependent vowel signs (diacritics) around the consonants, often including a sign that explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel. If a consonant has no vowel sign, this indicates a default vowel. Vowel diacritics may appear above, below, to the left, to the right, or around the consonant.

The most widely used Indic script is <a href="Devanagari">Devanagari</a>, shared by <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>, <a href="Bhojpuri">Bhojpuri</a>, <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi</a>, <a href="Konkani%20language">Konkani</a>, <a href="Nepali%20language">Nepali</a>, and often <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. A basic letter such as <a href="Devanagari%20ka">क</a> in Hindi represents a syllable with the default vowel, in this case "ka" (). In some languages, including Hindi, it becomes a final closing consonant at the end of a word, in this case "k". The inherent vowel may be changed by adding vowel mark (<a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>s), producing syllables such as कि "ki," कु "ku," के "ke," को "ko."

In many of the Brahmic scripts, a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking, so a vowel marker like ि "-i," falling before the character it modifies, may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced. For example, the game <a href="cricket">cricket</a> in <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> is क्रिकेट "krikeţ;" the diacritic for appears before the <a href="consonant%20cluster">consonant cluster</a> , not before the . A more unusual example is seen in the <a href="Batak%20alphabet">Batak alphabet</a>: Here the syllable "bim" is written "ba-ma-i-(virama)". That is, the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants for the whole syllable.

In many abugidas, there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel, yielding the bare consonant. In <a href="Devanagari">Devanagari</a>, क् is "k," and ल् is "l". This is called the "<a href="vir%C4%81ma">virāma</a>" or "halantam" in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. It may be used to form <a href="consonant%20cluster">consonant cluster</a>s, or to indicate that a consonant occurs at the end of a word. Thus in Sanskrit, a default vowel consonant such as क does not take on a final consonant sound. Instead, it keeps its vowel. For writing two consonants without a vowel in between, instead of using diacritics on the first consonant to remove its vowel, another popular method of special <a href="conjunct">conjunct</a> forms is used in which two or more consonant characters are merged to express a cluster, such as Devanagari: क्ल "kla." (Note that some fonts display this as क् followed by ल, rather than forming a conjunct. This expedient is used by <a href="ISCII">ISCII</a> and South Asian scripts of <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a>.) Thus a closed syllable such as "kal" requires two "aksharas" to write.

The <a href="R%C3%B3ng">Róng</a> script used for the <a href="Lepcha%20language">Lepcha language</a> goes further than other Indic abugidas, in that a single "akshara" can represent a closed syllable: Not only the vowel, but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic. For example, the syllable [sok] would be written as something like s̥̽, here with an underring representing and an overcross representing the diacritic for final . Most other Indic abugidas can only indicate a very limited set of final consonants with diacritics, such as or , if they can indicate any at all.

In <a href="Ethiopic%20script">Ethiopic</a> (where the term "abugida" originates) the diacritics have been fused to the consonants to the point that they must be considered modifications of the form of the letters. Children learn each modification separately, as in a syllabary; nonetheless, the graphic similarities between syllables with the same consonant is readily apparent, unlike the case in a true syllabary.

Though now an abugida, the <a href="Ge%27ez%20script">Ge'ez script</a>, until the advent of Christianity ("ca." AD 350), had originally been what would now be termed an "<a href="abjad">abjad</a>". In the Ge'ez abugida (or "fidel"), the base form of the letter (also known as "fidel") may be altered. For example, ሀ "hä" (base form), ሁ "hu" (with a right-side diacritic that doesn't alter the letter), ሂ "hi" (with a subdiacritic that compresses the consonant, so it is the same height), ህ "hə" or (where the letter is modified with a kink in the left arm).

In the family known as <a href="Canadian%20Aboriginal%20syllabics">Canadian Aboriginal syllabics</a>, which was inspired by the <a href="Devanagari%20script">Devanagari script</a> of India, vowels are indicated by changing the orientation of the <a href="syllabogram">syllabogram</a>. Each vowel has a consistent orientation; for example, <a href="Inuktitut">Inuktitut</a> ᐱ "pi," ᐳ "pu," ᐸ "pa;" ᑎ "ti," ᑐ "tu," ᑕ "ta". Although there is a vowel inherent in each, all rotations have equal status and none can be identified as basic. Bare consonants are indicated either by separate diacritics, or by superscript versions of the "aksharas"; there is no vowel-killer mark.

Consonantal scripts ("<a href="abjad">abjad</a>s") are normally written without indication of many vowels. However, in some contexts like teaching materials or <a href="scripture">scripture</a>s, <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> and <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> are written with full indication of vowels via diacritic marks ("<a href="harakat">harakat</a>", "<a href="niqqud">niqqud</a>") making them effectively alphasyllabaries. The Brahmic and Ethiopic families are thought to have originated from the Semitic abjads by the addition of vowel marks.
The Arabic scripts used for <a href="Sorani%20Kurdish">Kurdish</a> in Iraq and for <a href="Uyghur%20language">Uyghur</a> in <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, as well as the Hebrew script of <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a>, are fully vowelled, but because the vowels are written with full letters rather than diacritics (with the exception of distinguishing between /a/ and /o/ in the latter) and there are no inherent vowels, these are considered alphabets, not abugidas.

The imperial Mongol script called <a href="%27Phags-pa%20script">Phagspa</a> was derived from the Tibetan abugida, but all vowels are written in-line rather than as diacritics. However, it retains the features of having an inherent vowel /a/ and having distinct initial vowel letters.

<a href="Pahawh%20Hmong">Pahawh Hmong</a> is a non-segmental script that indicates <a href="syllable%20onset">syllable onset</a>s and <a href="syllable%20rime">rime</a>s, such as consonant clusters and vowels with final consonants. Thus it is not segmental and cannot be considered an abugida. However, it superficially resembles an abugida with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Most syllables are written with two letters in the order rime–onset (typically vowel-consonant), even though they are pronounced as onset-rime (consonant-vowel), rather like the position of the vowel in Devanagari, which is written before the consonant. Pahawh is also unusual in that, while an inherent rime (with mid tone) is unwritten, it also has an inherent onset . For the syllable , which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt, it is that is written. Thus it is the rime (vowel) that is basic to the system.

It is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other <a href="segment%20%28linguistics%29">segmental</a> scripts. For example, the <a href="Meroitic%20script">Meroitic script</a> of ancient <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> did not indicate an inherent "a" (one symbol stood for both "m" and "ma," for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family of abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel.

Several systems of <a href="shorthand">shorthand</a> use diacritics for vowels, but they do not have an inherent vowel, and are thus more similar to <a href="Thaana">Thaana</a> and <a href="Kurdish%20alphabet">Kurdish script</a> than to the Brahmic scripts. The <a href="Gabelsberger%20shorthand">Gabelsberger shorthand</a> system and its derivatives modify the "following" consonant to represent vowels. The <a href="Pollard%20script">Pollard script</a>, which was based on shorthand, also uses diacritics for vowels; the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates <a href="tone%20%28linguistics%29">tone</a>. <a href="Pitman%20shorthand">Pitman shorthand</a> uses straight strokes and quarter-circle marks in different orientations as the principal "alphabet" of consonants; vowels are shown as light and heavy dots, dashes and other marks in one of 3 possible positions to indicate the various vowel-sounds. However, to increase writing speed, Pitman has rules for <a href="http%3A//pitmanshorthand.homestead.com">"vowel indication"</a> using the positioning or choice of consonant signs so that writing vowel-marks can be dispensed with.

As the term "alphasyllabary" suggests, abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>s and <a href="syllabary">syllabaries</a>. Historically, abugidas appear to have evolved from <a href="abjad">abjad</a>s (vowelless alphabets). They contrast with syllabaries, where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant-vowel combination, and where these have no systematic similarity to each other, and typically develop directly from <a href="logogram">logographic scripts</a>. Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese <a href="hiragana">hiragana</a> syllabary: か "ka", き "ki", く "ku", け "ke", こ "ko" have nothing in common to indicate "k;" while ら "ra", り "ri", る "ru", れ "re", ろ "ro" have neither anything in common for "r", nor anything to indicate that they have the same vowels as the "k" set.

Most Indian and Indochinese abugidas appear to have first been developed from abjads with the <a href="Kharo%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADh%C4%AB">Kharoṣṭhī</a> and <a href="Br%C4%81hm%C4%AB%20script">Brāhmī script</a>s; the abjad in question is usually considered to be the <a href="Aramaic%20alphabet">Aramaic</a> one, but while the link between Aramaic and Kharosthi is more or less undisputed, this is not the case with Brahmi. The Kharosthi family does not survive today, but Brahmi's descendants include most of the modern scripts of <a href="South%20Asia">South</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Ge'ez derived from a different abjad, the <a href="Sabaean%20language%23Script">Sabean script</a> of <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>; the advent of vowels coincided with the introduction of Christianity about AD 350.

The Ethiopic script is the elaboration of an abjad.

The <a href="Canadian%20Aboriginal%20syllabics%23history">Cree family</a> was invented with full knowledge of the Devanagari system.

The <a href="Meroitic%20script">Meroitic script</a> was developed from <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>, within which various schemes of 'group writing' had been used for showing vowels.

ABBA were the first group from a non-English-speaking country to achieve consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Irish%20Recorded%20Music%20Association">Ireland</a>, <a href="Canadian%20Hot%20100">Canada</a>, <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Australia</a>, <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Recording%20Industry%20of%20South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">United States</a>. They have a joint record eight consecutive number-one albums in the UK. The group also enjoyed significant success in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, and recorded a <a href="Gracias%20Por%20La%20M%C3%BAsica%20%28album%29">collection</a> of their hit songs in Spanish.

During the band's active years, Fältskog & Ulvaeus and Lyngstad & Andersson were married. At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Ulvaeus–Fältskog marriage in 1979 and the Andersson–Lyngstad marriage in 1981. These relationship changes were reflected in the group's music, with later compositions featuring more introspective and dark lyrics in contrast to their usual pure-pop sound.

After ABBA disbanded in December 1982, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage, while Lyngstad and Fältskog pursued solo careers with mixed success. ABBA's music declined in popularity until the purchase of ABBA's catalogue and record company Polar by Polygram in 1989 enabled the groundwork to be laid for an international re-issue of all their original material and a new Greatest Hits (<a href="ABBA%20Gold">ABBA Gold</a>) collection in September 1992 which became a worldwide smash. Several films, notably "<a href="Muriel%27s%20Wedding">Muriel's Wedding</a>" (1994) and "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Priscilla%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Desert">The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</a>" (1994), further revived public interest in the group and the spawning of several <a href="tribute%20band">tribute band</a>s. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21">Mamma Mia!</a>" that toured worldwide. <a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28film%29">A film of the same name</a>, released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year.

ABBA were honoured at the 50th anniversary celebration of the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> in 2005, when their hit "<a href="Waterloo%20%28ABBA%20song%29">Waterloo</a>" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history. The group was inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 2010. In 2015, their song "<a href="Dancing%20Queen">Dancing Queen</a>" was inducted into the <a href="Recording%20Academy">Recording Academy</a>'s <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Grammy Hall of Fame</a>.

<a href="Benny%20Andersson">Benny Andersson</a> (born 16 December 1946 in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden) became (at age 18) a member of a popular Swedish pop-rock group, the <a href="Hep%20Stars">Hep Stars</a>, that performed covers, amongst other things, of international hits. The Hep Stars were known as "the Swedish Beatles". They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of <a href="Apple%20Corps">Apple Corps</a>. Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band, many of which became major hits, including "No Response" that hit number-three in 1965, "Sunny Girl", "Wedding", and "Consolation", all of which hit number-one in 1966. Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with <a href="Lasse%20Berghagen">Lasse Berghagen</a>, with whom he wrote his first <a href="Svensktoppen">Svensktoppen</a> entry, "Sagan om lilla Sofie" ("The Story of Little Sophie"), in 1968.

<a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Ulvaeus">Björn Ulvaeus</a> (born 25 April 1945 in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, Sweden) also began his musical career at 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted <a href="the%20Hootenanny%20Singers">the Hootenanny Singers</a>, a popular Swedish <a href="folk%20music">folk</a>–<a href="skiffle">skiffle</a> group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and the Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was "Isn't It Easy to Say", a song later recorded by the Hep Stars. <a href="Stig%20Anderson">Stig Anderson</a> was the manager of the Hootenanny Singers and founder of the <a href="Polar%20Music">Polar Music</a> label. He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to write more. The two also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: "<a href="Ljuva%20sextital">Ljuva sextital</a>" ("Sweet Sixties"), recorded by Brita Borg, and the Hep Stars' 1969 hit "Speleman" ("Fiddler").

Andersson wrote and submitted the song "Hej, Clown" for <a href="Melodifestivalen%201969">Melodifestivalen 1969</a>, the national festival to select the <a href="Sweden%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Swedish entry</a> to the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>. The song tied for first place, but re-voting relegated Andersson's song to second place. On that occasion Andersson briefly met his future spouse, singer <a href="Anni-Frid%20Lyngstad">Anni-Frid Lyngstad</a>, who also participated in the contest. A month later, the two had become a couple. As their respective bands began to break up during 1969, Andersson and Ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970, called "<a href="Lycka">Lycka</a>" ("Happiness"), which included original songs sung by both men. Their spouses were often present in the recording studio, and sometimes added backing vocals; Fältskog even co-wrote a song with the two. Ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with the Hootenanny Singers until the middle of 1974, and Andersson took part in producing their records.

<a href="Agnetha%20F%C3%A4ltskog">Agnetha Fältskog</a> (born 5 April 1950 in <a href="J%C3%B6nk%C3%B6ping">Jönköping</a>, Sweden) sang with a local dance band headed by Bernt Enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lundkvist. The demo tape featured a song written and sung by Agnetha: "Jag var så kär". Lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star. After going through considerable effort to locate the singer, he arranged for Agnetha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her own songs. This led to Agnetha at the age of 18 having a number-one record in Sweden with a self-composed song, which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies. She was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer/songwriter of <a href="schlager%20music">schlager</a> style songs. Fältskog's main inspiration in her early years were singers such as <a href="Connie%20Francis">Connie Francis</a>. Along with her own compositions, she recorded <a href="Cover%20version">covers</a> of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish <a href="folkpark">folkpark</a>s. Most of her biggest hits were self-composed, which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s. Agnetha released four solo LPs between 1968 and 1971. She had many successful singles in the Swedish charts.

During filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969, Fältskog met Ulvaeus, and they married on 6 July 1971. Fältskog and Ulvaeus eventually were involved in each other's recording sessions, and soon even Andersson and Lyngstad added backing vocals to her third studio album, "Som jag är" ("As I Am") (1970). In 1972, Fältskog starred as <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> in the original Swedish production of "<a href="Jesus%20Christ%20Superstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</a>" and attracted favourable reviews. Between 1967 and 1975, Fältskog released five studio albums.

<a href="Anni-Frid%20Lyngstad">Anni-Frid "Frida" Lyngstad</a> (born 15 November 1945 in Bjørkåsen in <a href="Ballangen">Ballangen</a>, Norway) sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands, and worked mainly in a jazz-oriented cabaret style. She also formed her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. In the middle of 1967, she won a national talent competition with "En ledig dag" ("A Day Off") a Swedish version of the bossa nova song "A Day in Portofino", which is included in the EMI compilation "<a href="Frida%201967%E2%80%931972">Frida 1967–1972</a>". The first prize was a recording contract with <a href="EMI">EMI</a> Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country. This TV performance, amongst many others, is included in the 3½-hour documentary "<a href="Frida%20%E2%80%93%20The%20DVD">Frida – The DVD</a>". Lyngstad released several <a href="schlager">schlager</a> style singles on EMI without much success. When Benny Andersson started to produce her recordings in 1971, she had her first number-one single, "Min egen stad" ("My Own Town"), written by Benny and featuring all the future ABBA members on backing vocals. Lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and TV. She met Ulvaeus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest, and Fältskog during a TV show in early 1968.

Lyngstad finally linked up with her future bandmates in 1969. On 1 March 1969, she participated in the Melodifestival, where she met Andersson for the first time. A few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple. Andersson produced her single "Peter Pan" in September 1969—her first collaboration with Benny & Björn, as they had written the song. Andersson would then produce Lyngstad's debut studio album, "<a href="Frida%20%28album%29">Frida</a>", which was released in March 1971. Lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973. After ABBA formed, she recorded another successful album in 1975, "<a href="Frida%20ensam">Frida ensam</a>", which included a Swedish rendition of "<a href="Fernando%20%28song%29">Fernando</a>", a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released.

An attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. What started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island. Andersson and Ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together, "Lycka", which was to be released in September 1970. Fältskog and Lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during June, and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act, "Festfolket" (which translates from Swedish to mean both "Party People" and "Engaged Couples"), on 1 November 1970 in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>.

The cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews, except for the performance of the Andersson and Ulvaeus hit "Hej, gamle man" ("Hello, Old Man")–the first Björn and Benny recording to feature all four. They also performed solo numbers from respective albums, but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being, and each soon concentrated on individual projects again.

"Hej, gamle man", a song about an old <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> soldier, became the quartet's first hit. The record was credited to Björn & Benny and reached number-five on the sales charts and number one on <a href="Svensktoppen">Svensktoppen</a>, staying there for 15 weeks.

It was during 1971 that the four artists began working together more, adding vocals to the others' recordings. Fältskog, Andersson and Ulvaeus toured together in May, while Lyngstad toured on her own. Frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer.

After the 1970 release of "Lycka", two more singles credited to 'Björn & Benny' were released in Sweden, "Det kan ingen doktor hjälpa" ("No Doctor Can Help with That") and "Tänk om jorden vore ung" ("Imagine If the Earth Were Young"), with more prominent vocals by Fältskog and Lyngstad–and moderate chart success.

Fältskog and Ulvaeus, now married, started performing together with Andersson on a regular basis at the Swedish folkparks in the middle of 1971.

<a href="Stig%20Anderson">Stig Anderson</a>, founder and owner of <a href="Polar%20Music">Polar Music</a>, was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Andersson and Ulvaeus. "One day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit", he predicted. Stig Anderson encouraged Ulvaeus and Andersson to write a song for Melodifestivalen, and after two rejected entries in 1971, Andersson and Ulvaeus submitted their new song "Säg det med en sång" ("Say It with a Song") for the 1972 contest, choosing newcomer Lena Anderson to perform. The song came in third place, encouraging Stig Anderson, and became a hit in Sweden.

The first signs of foreign success came as a surprise, as the Andersson and Ulvaeus single "She's My Kind of Girl" was released through <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic Records</a> in Japan in March 1972, giving the duo a Top 10 hit. Two more singles were released in Japan, "En Carousel" ("En Karusell" in Scandinavia, an earlier version of "Merry-Go-Round") and "Love Has Its Ways" (a song they wrote with <a href="K%C5%8Dichi%20Morita%20%28songwriter%29">Kōichi Morita</a>).

Ulvaeus and Andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements. "<a href="People%20Need%20Love">People Need Love</a>" was released in June 1972, featuring guest vocals by the women, who were now given much greater prominence. Stig Anderson released it as a single, credited to "Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid". The song peaked at number 17 in the Swedish combined single and album charts, enough to convince them they were on to something. The single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the United States, where it peaked at number 114 on the "<a href="Cashbox%20%28magazine%29">Cashbox</a>" singles chart and number 117 on the "<a href="Record%20World">Record World</a>" singles chart. Labeled as "Björn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka)", it was released there through <a href="Playboy%20Records">Playboy Records</a>. However, according to Stig Anderson, "People Need Love" could have been a much bigger American hit, but a small label like Playboy Records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers.

The foursome decided to record their first album together in late 1972, and sessions began on 26 September 1972. The women shared lead vocals on "Nina, Pretty Ballerina" (a top ten hit in Austria) that day, and their voices in harmony for the first time gave the foursome an idea of the quality of their combined talents.

In 1973, the band and their manager Stig Anderson decided to have another try at Melodifestivalen, this time with the song "<a href="Ring%20Ring%20%28song%29">Ring Ring</a>". The studio sessions were handled by <a href="Michael%20B.%20Tretow">Michael B. Tretow</a>, who experimented with a "<a href="wall%20of%20sound">wall of sound</a>" production technique that became the wholly new sound. Stig Anderson arranged an English translation of the lyrics by <a href="Neil%20Sedaka">Neil Sedaka</a> and Phil Cody and they thought this would be a surefire winner. However, on 10 February 1973, the song came third in Melodifestivalen; thus it never reached the Eurovision Song Contest itself. Nevertheless, the group released their debut studio album, also called "<a href="Ring%20Ring%20%28album%29">Ring Ring</a>". The album did well and the "Ring Ring" single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa. However, Stig Anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit.

When Agnetha Fältskog gave birth to her first child in 1973, she was replaced for a short period by Inger Brundin on a trip to West Germany.

In 1973, Stig Anderson, tired of unwieldy names, started to refer to the group privately and publicly as ABBA. At first, this was a play on words, as <a href="Abba%20Seafood">Abba</a> is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an acronym. However, since the fish-canners were unknown outside Sweden, Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets. A competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Gothenburg newspaper and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as "ABBA." The group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name. "ABBA" is an <a href="acronym">acronym</a> formed from the first letters of each group member's first name: Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid. The earliest known example of "ABBA" written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Metronome Studio in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> dated 16 October 1973. This was first written as "Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida", but was subsequently crossed out with "ABBA" written in large letters on top.

Their official logo, distinct with the backward ‘B', was designed by Rune Söderqvist, who designed most of ABBA’s record sleeves. The logo first appeared on the French compilation album, Golden Double Album, released in May 1976 by <a href="Disques%20Vogue">Disques Vogue</a>, and would henceforth be used for all official releases.

The idea for the official logo was made by the German photographer Wolfgang "Bubi" Heilemann () on a velvet jumpsuit photo shoot for the teenage magazine <a href="Bravo%20%28magazine%29">Bravo</a>. On the photo, the ABBA members held a giant initial letter of his/her name. After the pictures were made, Heilemann found out that Benny Andersson reversed his letter "B"; this prompted discussions about the mirrored "B", and the members of ABBA agreed on the mirrored letter. From 1976 onwards, the first 'B' in the logo version of the name was "mirror-image" reversed on the band's promotional material, thus becoming the group's <a href="registered%20trademark">registered trademark</a>. 

Following their acquisition of the group's catalogue, PolyGram began using variations of the ABBA logo, using a different font and adding a crown emblem to it in 1992 for the first release of the "ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits" compilation. When Universal Music purchased PolyGram (and, thus, ABBA's label Polar Music International), control of the group's catalogue was returned to Stockholm. Since then, the original logo has been reinstated on all official products.

As the group entered the Melodifestivalen with "<a href="Ring%20Ring%20%28song%29">Ring Ring</a>" but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry, Stig Anderson immediately started planning for the 1974 contest.

Ulvaeus, Andersson and Stig Anderson believed in the possibilities of using the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> as a way to make the music business aware of them as songwriters, as well as the band itself. In late 1973, they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the <a href="Melodifestivalen%201974">Melodifestivalen 1974</a> and from a number of new songs, the upbeat song "<a href="Waterloo%20%28ABBA%20song%29">Waterloo</a>" was chosen; the group was now inspired by the growing <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> scene in England.

ABBA won their national heats on Swedish television on 9 February 1974, and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the Eurovision Song Contest. Winning the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%201974">1974 Contest</a> on 6 April 1974 gave ABBA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major television shows; thus the band saw the "Waterloo" single chart in many European countries. "Waterloo" was ABBA's first number-one single in big markets such as the UK and West Germany. In the United States, the song peaked at number-six on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart, paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there. Albeit a short promotional visit, it included their first performance on American television, "<a href="The%20Mike%20Douglas%20Show">The Mike Douglas Show</a>". The album "<a href="Waterloo%20%28album%29">Waterloo</a>" only peaked at number 145 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, but received unanimous high praise from the US critics: "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" called it "a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively … an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project", while "<a href="Creem">Creem</a>" characterized it as "a perfect blend of exceptional, lovable compositions".

ABBA's follow-up single, "<a href="Honey%2C%20Honey">Honey, Honey</a>", peaked at number 27 on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, and was a number-two hit in West Germany. However, in the United Kingdom, ABBA's British record label, Epic, decided to re-release a remixed version of "Ring Ring" instead of "Honey, Honey", and a cover version of the latter by <a href="Sweet%20Dreams%20%281970s%20band%29">Sweet Dreams</a> peaked at number 10. Both records debuted on the UK chart within one week of each other. "Ring Ring" failed to reach the Top 30 in the United Kingdom, increasing growing speculation that the group was simply a Eurovision <a href="one-hit%20wonder">one-hit wonder</a>.

In November 1974, ABBA embarked on their first European tour, playing dates in Denmark, West Germany and Austria. It was not as successful as the band had hoped, since most of the venues did not sell out. Due to a lack of demand, they were even forced to cancel a few shows, including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland. The second leg of the tour, which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975, was very different. They played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for. Live performances continued in the middle of 1975 when ABBA embarked on a fourteen open-air date tour of Sweden and Finland. Their <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> show at the <a href="Gr%C3%B6na%20Lund">Gröna Lund</a> amusement park had an estimated audience of 19,200. Björn Ulvaeus later said that "If you look at the singles we released straight after Waterloo, we were trying to be more like the <a href="The%20Sweet">Sweet</a>, a semi-glam rock group, which was stupid because we were always a pop group."

In late 1974, "So Long" was released as a single in the United Kingdom but it received no airplay from Radio 1 and failed to chart. In the middle of 1975, ABBA released "<a href="I%20Do%2C%20I%20Do%2C%20I%20Do%2C%20I%20Do%2C%20I%20Do">I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do</a>", which again received little airplay on Radio 1 but managed to climb the charts, to number 38. Later that year, the release of their self-titled third studio album "<a href="ABBA%20%28album%29">ABBA</a>" and single "<a href="SOS%20%28ABBA%20song%29">SOS</a>" brought back their chart presence in the UK, where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number 13. "SOS" also became ABBA's second number-one single in Germany and their third in Australia. Success was further solidified with "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%20%28song%29">Mamma Mia</a>" reaching number-one in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. In the United States, "<a href="SOS%20%28ABBA%20song%29">SOS</a>" peaked at number 10 on the <a href="Record%20World">Record World</a> Top 100 singles chart and number 15 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, picking up the <a href="Broadcast%20Music%2C%20Inc.">BMI</a> Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975.

The success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases. By early 1976, the group already had four Top 30 singles on the US charts, but the album market proved to be tough to crack. The eponymous "ABBA " album generated three American hits, but it only peaked at number 165 on the "Cashbox" album chart and number 174 on the "Billboard" 200 chart. Opinions were voiced, by "Creem" in particular, that in the US ABBA had endured "a very sloppy promotional campaign". Nevertheless, the group enjoyed warm reviews from the American press. "<a href="Cashbox%20%28magazine%29">Cashbox</a>" went as far as saying that "there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in Abba's marketing, creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts", while "Creem" wrote: "SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind boggles".

In Australia, the airing of the music videos for "I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do" and "Mamma Mia" on the nationally broadcast TV pop show "<a href="Countdown%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29">Countdown</a>" (which premiered in November 1974) saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity, and "Countdown" become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos. This started an immense interest for ABBA in Australia, resulting in both the single and album holding down the No. 1 positions on the charts for months.

In March 1976, the band released the compilation album "<a href="Greatest%20Hits%20%28ABBA%20album%29">Greatest Hits</a>", despite having had only six top 40 hits in the United Kingdom and the United States. Nevertheless, it became their first UK number-one album, and also took ABBA into the Top 50 on the US album charts for the first time, eventually selling more than a million copies there. At the same time, Germany released a compilation named "The Very Best of ABBA", also becoming a number-one album there whereas the "Greatest Hits" compilation followed a few months later to number-two on the German charts, despite all similarities with "The Very Best" album. Also included on "Greatest Hits" was a new single, "<a href="Fernando%20%28song%29">Fernando</a>", which went to number-one in at least thirteen countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, and the single went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. In Australia, the song occupied the top position for 14 weeks (and stayed in the chart for 40 weeks), tying with <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' "<a href="Hey%20Jude">Hey Jude</a>" for longest-running number-one, and making "Fernando" one of the best-selling singles of all time in Australia. That same year, the group received its first international prize, with "Fernando" being chosen as the "Best Studio Recording of 1975". In the United States, "Fernando" reached the Top 10 of the Cashbox Top 100 singles chart and number 13 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. It also topped the <a href="Adult%20Contemporary%20%28chart%29">"Billboard" Adult Contemporary</a> chart, ABBA's first American number-one single on any chart.

The group's fourth studio album, "<a href="Arrival%20%28ABBA%20album%29">Arrival</a>", a number-one bestseller in Europe and Australia, represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work, prompting rave reviews from more rock-oriented UK music weeklies such as "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" and "<a href="NME">New Musical Express</a>", and mostly appreciative notices from US critics. Hit after hit flowed from "Arrival": "<a href="Money%2C%20Money%2C%20Money">Money, Money, Money</a>", another number-one in Germany and Australia, and "<a href="Knowing%20Me%2C%20Knowing%20You">Knowing Me, Knowing You</a>", ABBA's sixth consecutive German number-one as well as another UK number-one. The real sensation was "<a href="Dancing%20Queen">Dancing Queen</a>", not only topping the charts in loyal markets the UK, Germany and Australia, but also reaching number-one in the United States. In South Africa, ABBA had astounding success with "Fernando", "Dancing Queen" and "Knowing Me, Knowing You" being among the top 20 best-selling singles for 1976–77. In 1977, "Arrival" was nominated for the inaugural <a href="Brit%20Awards">BRIT Award</a> in the category "Best International Album of the Year". By this time ABBA were popular in the United Kingdom, most of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In "Frida – The DVD", Lyngstad explains how she and Fältskog developed as singers, as ABBA's recordings grew more complex over the years.

The band's popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale, and "Dancing Queen" became the only "Billboard" Hot 100 number-one single ABBA had there (they did, however, get three more singles to the number-one position on other "Billboard" charts, including "Billboard" Adult Contemporary and <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Play">Hot Dance Club Play</a>). Nevertheless, "Arrival" finally became a true breakthrough release for ABBA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the "Billboard" 200 chart and was certified gold by <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a>.

In January 1977, ABBA embarked on their first major tour. The group's status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars. They opened their much anticipated tour in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, Norway, on 28 January, and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self-written mini-operetta "The Girl with the Golden Hair". The concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia. They continued the tour through Western Europe, visiting <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, Copenhagen, Berlin, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Amsterdam, <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, <a href="Essen">Essen</a>, <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, and <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and ending with shows in the United Kingdom in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, Birmingham, Glasgow and two sold-out concerts at London's <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>. Tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box-office received 3.5 million requests for tickets, enough to fill the venue 580 times. Along with praise ("ABBA turn out to be amazingly successful at reproducing their records", wrote "<a href="Creem">Creem</a>"), there were complaints that "ABBA performed slickly...but with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage" ("<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>"). One of the Royal Albert Hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the Australian tour for what became "", though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed.
After the European leg of the tour, in March 1977, ABBA played 11 dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people. The opening concert in Sydney at the <a href="Sydney%20Showground%20%28Moore%20Park%29">Sydney Showground</a> on 3 March to an audience of 20,000 was marred by torrential rain with Lyngstad slipping on the wet stage during the concert. However, all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career. Upon their arrival in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, a civic reception was held at the <a href="Melbourne%20Town%20Hall">Melbourne Town Hall</a> and ABBA appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of 6,000. In Melbourne, the group played three concerts at the <a href="Sidney%20Myer%20Music%20Bowl">Sidney Myer Music Bowl</a> with 14,500 at each including the Australian Prime Minister <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> and his family. At the first Melbourne concert, an additional 16,000 people gathered outside the fenced-off area to listen to the concert. In <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, the group performed one concert at <a href="Football%20Park">West Lakes Football Stadium</a> before 20,000 people, with another 10,000 listening outside. During the first of five concerts in Perth, there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the <a href="Perth%20Entertainment%20Centre">Entertainment Centre</a>. The trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention ("Swedish ABBA stirs box-office in Down Under tour...and the media coverage of the quartet rivals that set to cover the upcoming Royal tour of Australia", wrote "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"), and is captured on film in "", directed by <a href="Lasse%20Hallstr%C3%B6m">Lasse Hallström</a>.

The Australian tour and its subsequent "ABBA: The Movie" produced some ABBA lore, as well. Fältskog's blonde good looks had long made her the band's "pin-up girl", a role she disdained. During the Australian tour, she performed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline "Agnetha's bottom tops dull show". When asked about this at a news conference, she replied: "Don't they have bottoms in Australia?"

In December 1977, ABBA followed up "Arrival" with the more ambitious fifth album "", released to coincide with the debut of "ABBA: The Movie". Although the album was less well received by UK reviewers, it did spawn more worldwide hits: "<a href="The%20Name%20of%20the%20Game%20%28ABBA%20song%29">The Name of the Game</a>" and "<a href="Take%20a%20Chance%20on%20Me">Take a Chance on Me</a>", which both topped the UK charts, and peaked at number 12 and number three, respectively, on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in the US. Although "Take a Chance on Me" did not top the American charts, it proved to be ABBA's biggest hit single there, selling more copies than "Dancing Queen". "The Album" also included "<a href="Thank%20You%20for%20the%20Music">Thank You for the Music</a>", the B-side of "<a href="Eagle%20%28song%29">Eagle</a>" in countries where the latter had been released as a single, and was belatedly released as an A-side single in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1983. "<a href="Thank%20You%20for%20the%20Music">Thank You for the Music</a>" has become one of the best loved and best known ABBA songs without being released as a single during the group's lifetime.

By 1978 ABBA were one of the biggest bands in the world. They converted a vacant movie theatre into the <a href="Polar%20Music">Polar Music</a> Studio, a state-of-the-art studio in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. The studio was used by several other bands; notably <a href="Genesis%20%28band%29">Genesis</a>' "<a href="Duke%20%28album%29">Duke</a>" and <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s "<a href="In%20Through%20the%20Out%20Door">In Through the Out Door</a>" were recorded there. During May, the group went to the United States for a promotional campaign, performing alongside <a href="Andy%20Gibb">Andy Gibb</a> on <a href="Olivia%20Newton-John">Olivia Newton-John</a>'s TV show. Recording sessions for the single "<a href="Summer%20Night%20City">Summer Night City</a>" were an uphill struggle, but upon release the song became another hit for the group. The track would set the stage for ABBA's foray into <a href="disco">disco</a> with their next album.

On 9 January 1979, the group performed "<a href="Chiquitita">Chiquitita</a>" at the <a href="Music%20for%20UNICEF%20Concert">Music for UNICEF Concert</a> held at the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> to celebrate UNICEF's Year of the Child. ABBA donated the <a href="copyright">copyright</a> of this worldwide hit to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Children%27s%20Fund">UNICEF</a>; see <a href="Music%20for%20UNICEF%20Concert">Music for UNICEF Concert</a>. The single was released the following week, and reached number-one in ten countries.

 In mid-January 1979, Ulvaeus and Fältskog announced they were getting divorced. The news caused interest from the media and led to speculation about the band's future. ABBA assured the press and their fan base they were continuing their work as a group and that the divorce would not affect them. Nonetheless, the media continued to confront them with this in interviews. To escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing, Andersson and Ulvaeus secretly travelled to <a href="Compass%20Point%20Studios">Compass Point Studios</a> in <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau, Bahamas</a>, where for two weeks they prepared their next album's songs.

The group's sixth studio album, "<a href="Voulez-Vous">Voulez-Vous</a>", was released in April 1979, the title track of which was recorded at the famous <a href="Criteria%20Studios">Criteria Studios</a> in Miami, Florida, with the assistance of recording engineer <a href="Tom%20Dowd">Tom Dowd</a> amongst others. The album topped the charts across Europe and in Japan and Mexico, hit the Top 10 in Canada and Australia and the Top 20 in the United States. None of the singles from the album reached number-one on the UK charts, but "<a href="Chiquitita">Chiquitita</a>", "<a href="Does%20Your%20Mother%20Know">Does Your Mother Know</a>", "<a href="Angeleyes">Angeleyes</a>" (with "<a href="Voulez-Vous%20%28song%29">Voulez-Vous</a>", released as a double A-side) and "<a href="I%20Have%20a%20Dream%20%28song%29">I Have a Dream</a>" were all UK Top 5 hits. In Canada, "I Have a Dream" became ABBA's second number-one on the <a href="Revolutions%20per%20minute">RPM</a> Adult Contemporary chart (after "Fernando" hit the top previously). Also in 1979, the group released their second compilation album, "<a href="Greatest%20Hits%20Vol.%202%20%28ABBA%20album%29">Greatest Hits Vol. 2</a>", which featured a brand new track: "<a href="Gimme%21%20Gimme%21%20Gimme%21%20%28A%20Man%20After%20Midnight%29">Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)</a>", another number-three hit in both the UK and Germany. In Russia during the late 1970s, the group was paid in oil commodities because of an <a href="embargo">embargo</a> on the <a href="Soviet%20ruble">ruble</a>.

On 13 September 1979, ABBA began at <a href="Northlands%20Coliseum">Northlands Coliseum</a> in Edmonton, Canada, with a full house of 14,000. "The voices of the band, Agnetha's high sauciness combined with round, rich lower tones of Anni-Frid, were excellent...Technically perfect, melodically correct and always in perfect pitch...The soft lower voice of Anni-Frid and the high, edgy vocals of Agnetha were stunning", raved "<a href="Edmonton%20Journal">Edmonton Journal</a>".

During the next four weeks they played a total of 17 sold-out dates, 13 in the United States and four in Canada. The last scheduled ABBA concert in the United States in Washington, D.C. was cancelled due to Fältskog's emotional distress suffered during the flight from New York to Boston, when the group's private plane was subjected to <a href="Windsor%20Locks%2C%20Connecticut%20Tornado">extreme weather conditions</a> and was unable to land for an extended period. They appeared at the <a href="Citi%20Performing%20Arts%20Center">Boston Music Hall</a> for the performance 90 minutes late. The tour ended with a show in Toronto, Canada at <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a> before a capacity crowd of 18,000. "ABBA plays with surprising power and volume; but although they are loud, they're also clear, which does justice to the signature vocal sound...Anyone who's been waiting five years to see Abba will be well satisfied", wrote "<a href="Record%20World">Record World</a>".

On 19 October 1979, the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold-out gigs, including six sold-out nights at London's <a href="Wembley%20Arena">Wembley Arena</a>.

In March 1980, ABBA travelled to Japan where upon their arrival at <a href="Narita%20International%20Airport">Narita International Airport</a>, they were besieged by thousands of fans. The group played eleven concerts to full houses, including six shows at Tokyo's <a href="Nippon%20Budokan">Budokan</a>. This tour was the last "on the road" adventure of their career.
In the middle of 1980, the group released the single "<a href="The%20Winner%20Takes%20It%20All">The Winner Takes It All</a>" the group's eighth UK chart topper (and their first since 1978). The song is widely misunderstood as being written about Ulvaeus and Fältskog's marital tribulations; Ulvaeus wrote the lyrics, but has stated they were not about his own divorce; Fältskog has repeatedly stated she was not the loser in their divorce. In the United States, the single peaked at number-eight on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and became ABBA's second "Billboard" Adult Contemporary number-one. It was also re-recorded by Andersson and Ulvaeus with a slightly different backing track, by French chanteuse <a href="Mireille%20Mathieu">Mireille Mathieu</a> at the end of 1980 – as "Bravo Tu As Gagné", with French lyrics by Alain Boublil. November the same year saw the release of ABBA's seventh album "<a href="Super%20Trouper%20%28album%29">Super Trouper</a>", which reflected a certain change in ABBA's style with more prominent use of synthesizers and increasingly personal lyrics. It set a record for the most pre-orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release. The second single from the album, "<a href="Super%20Trouper%20%28song%29">Super Trouper</a>", also hit number-one in the UK, becoming the group's ninth and final UK chart-topper. Another track from the "Super Trouper" album, "<a href="Lay%20All%20Your%20Love%20on%20Me">Lay All Your Love on Me</a>", released in 1981 as a single only in selected territories, managed to top the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at number-seven on the UK singles chart becoming, at the time, the highest ever charting release in UK chart history.

Also in 1980, ABBA recorded a compilation of Spanish-language versions of their hits called "<a href="Gracias%20Por%20La%20M%C3%BAsica%20%28album%29">Gracias Por La Música</a>". This was released in Spanish-speaking countries as well as in Japan and Australia. The album became a major success, and along with the Spanish version of "Chiquitita", this signalled the group's breakthrough in Latin America. "ABBA Oro: Grandes Éxitos", the Spanish equivalent of "ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits", was released in 1999.

In January 1981, Ulvaeus married Lena Källersjö, and manager Stig Anderson celebrated his 50th birthday with a party. For this occasion, ABBA recorded the track "Hovas Vittne" (a pun on the Swedish name for <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witness">Jehovah's Witness</a> and Anderson's birthplace, <a href="Hova%2C%20Sweden">Hova</a>) as a tribute to him, and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies, to be distributed to the guests attending the party. This single has become a sought-after collectible. In mid-February 1981, Andersson and Lyngstad announced they were filing for divorce. Information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years, and Benny had already met another woman, Mona Nörklit, whom he married in November 1981.

Andersson and Ulvaeus had songwriting sessions in early 1981, and recording sessions began in mid-March. At the end of April, the group recorded a TV special, "<a href="Dick%20Cavett%20Meets%20ABBA">Dick Cavett Meets ABBA</a>" with the US talk show host <a href="Dick%20Cavett">Dick Cavett</a>. "<a href="The%20Visitors%20%28ABBA%20album%29">The Visitors</a>", ABBA's eighth and final studio album, showed a songwriting maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placing the band squarely in the pop genre, with catchy tunes and harmonies. Although not revealed at the time of its release, the album's title track, according to Ulvaeus, refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet-dominated states, while other tracks address topics like failed relationships, the threat of war, ageing, and loss of innocence. The album's only major single release, "<a href="One%20of%20Us%20%28ABBA%20song%29">One of Us</a>", proved to be the last of ABBA's nine number-one singles in Germany, this being in December 1981; and the swansong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart. "One of Us" was also ABBA's final Top 3 hit in the UK, reaching No. 1 on some charts (such as Record Mirror).

Although it topped the album charts across most of Europe, including Ireland, the UK and Germany, "The Visitors" was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France, Australia and Japan. A track from the album, "<a href="When%20All%20Is%20Said%20and%20Done%20%28song%29">When All Is Said and Done</a>", was released as a single in North America, Australia and New Zealand, and fittingly became ABBA's final Top 40 hit in the US (debuting on the US charts on 31 December 1981), while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10, and number-four on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada. The song's lyrics, as with "<a href="The%20Winner%20Takes%20It%20All">The Winner Takes It All</a>" and "One of Us", dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long-term partner, though it looked at the trauma more optimistically. With the now publicised story of Andersson and Lyngstad's divorce, speculation increased of tension within the band. Also released in the United States was the title track of "The Visitors", which hit the Top Ten on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart.

In the spring of 1982, songwriting sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings. Plans were not completely clear, but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested. The recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle, and only three songs were eventually recorded: "You Owe Me One", "I Am the City" and "Just Like That". Andersson and Ulvaeus were not satisfied with the outcome, so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer.

Back in the studio again in early August, the group had changed plans for the rest of the year: they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named "". New songwriting and recording sessions took place, and during October and December, they released the singles "<a href="The%20Day%20Before%20You%20Came">The Day Before You Came</a>"/"<a href="Cassandra%20%28ABBA%20song%29">Cassandra</a>" and "<a href="Under%20Attack">Under Attack</a>"/"<a href="You%20Owe%20Me%20One">You Owe Me One</a>", the A-sides of which were included on the compilation album. Neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, though "<a href="The%20Day%20Before%20You%20Came">The Day Before You Came</a>" became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The album went to number-one in the UK and Belgium, Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries. "Under Attack", the group's final release before disbanding, was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium.

"I Am the City" and "Just Like That" were left unreleased on "The Singles: The First Ten Years" for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album, though this never came to fruition. "I Am the City" was eventually released on the compilation album "" in 1993, while "Just Like That" has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Andersson and Ulvaeus. A reworked version of the verses ended up in the musical "<a href="Chess%20%28musical%29">Chess</a>". The chorus section of "Just Like That" was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994, as well as in the "ABBA Undeleted" medley featured on disc 9 of "The Complete Studio Recordings". Despite a number of requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of "Just Like That" in its entirety, even though the complete version surfaced on bootlegs.

The group travelled to London to promote "The Singles: The First Ten Years" in the first week of November 1982, appearing on "<a href="Saturday%20Superstore">Saturday Superstore</a>" and "<a href="The%20Late%2C%20Late%20Breakfast%20Show">The Late, Late Breakfast Show</a>", and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express. On 19 November 1982, ABBA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme Nöjesmaskinen, and on 11 December 1982, they made their last performance ever, transmitted to the UK on <a href="Noel%20Edmonds">Noel Edmonds</a>' "<a href="The%20Late%2C%20Late%20Breakfast%20Show">The Late, Late Breakfast Show</a>", through a live link from a TV studio in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>.

Andersson and Ulvaeus began collaborating with <a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a> in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project "<a href="Chess%20%28musical%29">Chess</a>", while Fältskog and Lyngstad both concentrated on international solo careers. While Andersson and Ulvaeus were working on the musical, a further co-operation among the three of them came with the musical "<a href="Abbacadabra">Abbacadabra</a>" that was produced in France for television. It was a children's musical utilising 14 ABBA songs. <a href="Alain%20Boublil">Alain</a> and Daniel Boublil, who wrote "<a href="Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables%20%28musical%29">Les Misérables</a>", had been in touch with Stig Anderson about the project, and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast. Boublil previously also wrote the French lyric for Mireille Mathieu's version of "The Winner Takes It All".

Lyngstad, who had recently moved to Paris, participated in the French version, and recorded a single, "Belle", a duet with French singer <a href="Daniel%20Balavoine">Daniel Balavoine</a>. The song was a cover of ABBA's 1976 instrumental track "<a href="Arrival%20%28song%29">Arrival</a>". As the single "Belle" sold well in France, <a href="Cameron%20Mackintosh">Cameron Mackintosh</a> wanted to stage an English-language version of the show in London, with the French lyrics translated by <a href="David%20Wood%20%28actor%29">David Wood</a> and <a href="Don%20Black%20%28lyricist%29">Don Black</a>; Andersson and Ulvaeus got involved in the project, and contributed with one new song, "I Am the Seeker". "Abbacadabra" premiered on 8 December 1983 at the Lyric Hammersmith Theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Lyngstad was also involved in this production, recording "Belle" in English as "Time", a duet with actor and singer <a href="B.%20A.%20Robertson">B. A. Robertson</a>: the single sold well, and was produced and recorded by Mike Batt.

Anni-Frid Lyngstad performed "I Have A Dream" with a children's choir on French television in 1984, solo.

All four members made their final public appearance, as four friends more than as ABBA, in January 1986, when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of "Tivedshambo", which was the first song written by their manager, Stig Anderson, for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday. The four had not seen each other for more than two years. That same year they also performed privately at another friend's 40th birthday: their old tour manager, <a href="Claes%20af%20Geijerstam">Claes af Geijerstam</a>. They sang a self-written song titled "Der Kleine Franz" that was later to resurface in "Chess". Also in 1986, "<a href="ABBA%20Live">ABBA Live</a>" was released, featuring selections of live performances from the group's 1977 and 1979 tours. The four members were guests at the 50th birthday of Görel Hanser in 1999. Hanser was a long-time friend of all four, and also former secretary of Stig Anderson. Honouring Görel, ABBA performed a Swedish birthday song "Med En Enkel Tulipan" <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>.

Benny Andersson has on several occasions performed old ABBA songs. In June 1992, he and Ulvaeus appeared with <a href="U2">U2</a> at a Stockholm concert, singing the chorus of "<a href="Dancing%20Queen">Dancing Queen</a>", and a few years later during the final performance of the B & B in Concert in Stockholm, Andersson joined the cast for an encore at the piano. Andersson frequently adds an ABBA song to the playlist when he performs with his <a href="Benny%20Anderssons%20Orkester">BAO</a> band. He also played the piano during new recordings of the ABBA songs "Like an Angel Passing Through My Room" with opera singer <a href="Anne%20Sofie%20von%20Otter">Anne Sofie von Otter</a>, and "When All Is Said and Done" with Swede <a href="Viktoria%20Tolstoy">Viktoria Tolstoy</a>. In 2002, Andersson and Ulvaeus both performed an a cappella rendition of the first verse of "Fernando" as they accepted their Ivor Novello award in London. Lyngstad performed and recorded an a cappella version of "Dancing Queen" with the Swedish group <a href="the%20Real%20Group">the Real Group</a> in 1993, and also re-recorded "I Have a Dream" with Swiss singer Dan Daniell in 2003.

ABBA has never officially announced the end of the group, but it has long been considered dissolved. Their final public performance together as ABBA was on the British TV programme "<a href="The%20Late%2C%20Late%20Breakfast%20Show">The Late, Late Breakfast Show</a>" (live from Stockholm) on 11 December 1982. While reminiscing on "<a href="The%20Day%20Before%20You%20Came">The Day Before You Came</a>", Ulvaeus said: "we might have continued for a while longer if that had been a number one". In January 1983, Fältskog started recording sessions for a solo album, as Lyngstad had successfully released her album "<a href="Something%27s%20Going%20On">Something's Going On</a>" some months earlier. Ulvaeus and Andersson, meanwhile, started songwriting sessions for the musical "Chess". In interviews at the time, Björn and Benny denied the split of ABBA ("Who are we without our ladies? Initials of <a href="Brigitte%20Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a>?"), and Lyngstad and Fältskog kept claiming in interviews that ABBA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984. Internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in <a href="Polar%20Music">Polar Music</a> during 1983. Except for a TV appearance in 1986, the foursome did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28film%29">Mamma Mia!</a>" movie on 4 July 2008.

In an interview with the "<a href="Sunday%20Telegraph">Sunday Telegraph</a>", following the premiere, Ulvaeus and Andersson confirmed that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again. Ulvaeus said: "We will never appear on stage again. [...] There is simply no motivation to re-group. Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were. Young, exuberant, full of energy and ambition. I remember <a href="Robert%20Plant">Robert Plant</a> saying <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> were a <a href="cover%20band">cover band</a> now because they cover all their own stuff. I think that hit the nail on the head."
However, on 3 January 2011, Fältskog, who has been long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and a major obstacle to any reunion, raised the possibility of reuniting for a one-off engagement. She admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members. In April 2013, she reiterated her hopes for reunion during an interview with "<a href="Die%20Zeit">Die Zeit</a>", stating: "If they ask me, I'll say yes."

In a May 2013 interview, Fältskog, aged 63 at the time, confirmed that an ABBA reunion will never occur: "I think we have to accept that it will not happen, because we are too old and each one of us has their own life. Too many years have gone by since we stopped, and there's really no meaning in putting us together again." Fältskog further explained that the band members remained on amicable terms: "It's always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic." In an April 2014 interview, Fältskog, when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said: "It's difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be: 'ABBA is going to record another song!' But as long as we can sing and play, then why not? I would love to, but it's up to Björn and Benny."

On 20 January 2016, all four original members of ABBA made a public appearance at "Mamma Mia the Party" in Stockholm. It was the first time all four original members of ABBA had appeared in public together since the "Mamma Mia" movie premiere 8 years earlier.

On 6 June 2016, the four members of ABBA appeared together for first time since 1986 at a private party at <a href="Berns%20Salonger">Berns Salonger</a> in Stockholm, which was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Andersson and Ulvaeus' first meeting. Fältskog and Lyngstad sang the ABBA song "<a href="The%20Way%20Old%20Friends%20Do">The Way Old Friends Do</a>" before they were joined on stage by Andersson and Ulvaeus. Some sources incorrectly reported that all four members performed the song, "Me and I". The confusion came from the opening lines of the song performed by Agnetha and Frida, "The Way Old Friends Do", as the opening lines to that song are, "You and I can share the silence".

<a href="Simon%20Fuller">Simon Fuller</a> announced in a statement in October 2016 that the group would be reuniting to work on a new 'digital entertainment experience'. More details on this project are to be announced in 2017.

In October 1984, Ulvaeus and Andersson together with lyricist <a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a> released the musical concept double-album "<a href="Chess%20%28musical%29">Chess</a>". The singles "<a href="One%20Night%20in%20Bangkok">One Night in Bangkok</a>" (with vocals by <a href="Murray%20Head">Murray Head</a> and <a href="Anders%20Glenmark">Anders Glenmark</a> ) and "<a href="I%20Know%20Him%20So%20Well">I Know Him So Well</a>" (a duet by <a href="Barbara%20Dickson">Barbara Dickson</a> and <a href="Elaine%20Paige">Elaine Paige</a>, and later also recorded by both <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> and <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>) were both hugely successful. The former reached number-one in Australia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland; number-two in Austria, France and New Zealand; number-three in Canada, Norway, Sweden and the US, as well as reaching the top 10 in a few other countries. In May 1986, the musical premiered in London's West End, and ran for almost three years. "Chess" also opened on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in April 1988, but closed within two months due to bad reviews. In Stockholm, the composers staged "Chess på svenska" ("Chess in Swedish") in 2003, with some new material, including the musical numbers ""Han är en man, han är ett barn"" ("He's a Man, He's a Child") and ""Glöm mig om du kan"" ("Forget Me If You Can"). In 2008, the musical was again revived for a successful staging at London's Royal Albert Hall which was subsequently released on DVD, and then in two successful separate touring productions in the United States and United Kingdom, in 2010.

Andersson and Ulvaeus' next project, "<a href="Kristina%20fr%C3%A5n%20Duvem%C3%A5la">Kristina från Duvemåla</a>", an epic Swedish musical, premiered in <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a>, in southern Sweden in October 1995. The musical ran for five years in Stockholm, and an English version has been in development for some considerable time. It has been reported that a Broadway production is in its earliest stages of pre-production. In the meantime, following some earlier workshops, a full presentation of the English translation of the musical in concert, now with the shortened name of ""Kristina"", took place to capacity crowds in September 2009 at New York's Carnegie Hall, and in April 2010 at London's Royal Albert Hall, followed by a CD release of the New York recordings.

Since 1983, besides "Chess" and "Kristina från Duvemåla", Benny Andersson has continued writing songs with Ulvaeus. The pair produced two English-language pop albums with Swedish duo <a href="Gemini%20%28Swedish%20band%29">Gemini</a> in 1985 and 1987. In 1987, Andersson also released his first solo album on his own label, Mono Music, called ""<a href="Klinga%20mina%20klockor">Klinga mina klockor</a>"" ("Ring My Bells"), all new material inspired by Swedish folk music – and followed it with his second album titled "<a href="November%201989%20%28album%29">November 1989</a>".

During the 1990s, Andersson wrote music for the popular Swedish cabaret quartet <a href="Ainbusk">Ainbusk Singers</a>, giving them two hits: "Lassie" and ""Älska mig"" ("Love me"), and later produced "<a href="Shapes%20%28album%29">Shapes</a>", an English-language album by group's <a href="Josefin%20Nilsson">Josefin Nilsson</a> with all-new material by Andersson and Ulvaeus. Andersson has also regularly written music for films (most notably to <a href="Roy%20Andersson">Roy Andersson</a>'s "<a href="Songs%20from%20the%20Second%20Floor">Songs from the Second Floor</a>"). In 2001, Andersson formed his own band, <a href="Benny%20Anderssons%20Orkester">Benny Anderssons Orkester</a> (BAO), which released three successful albums in 2001, 2004 and 2007. Andersson has the distinction of remaining the longest in the Swedish Radio <a href="Svensktoppen">Svensktoppen</a> charts; the song ""Du är min man"" ("You Are My Man"), sung by <a href="Helen%20Sj%C3%B6holm">Helen Sjöholm</a>, spent 278 weeks there between 2004 and 2009. Andersson released his third album <a href="BAO%203">BAO 3</a> in October 2007, of new material with his band BAO and vocalists Helen Sjöholm and <a href="Tommy%20K%C3%B6rberg">Tommy Körberg</a>, as well as playing to full houses at two of Sweden's largest concert venues in October and November 2007, with an audience of 14,000.

Andersson and Ulvaeus have been highly involved in the worldwide productions of the musical "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21">Mamma Mia!</a>", alongside Lyngstad who attends premieres. They were also involved in the production of the successful film version of the musical, which opened in July 2008. Andersson produced the soundtrack utilising many of the musicians ABBA used on their albums and tours. Andersson made a cameo appearance in the movie as a 'fisherman' piano player in the "Dancing Queen" scene, while Ulvaeus is seen as a Greek god playing a <a href="lyre">lyre</a> during the closing credits.

Andersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently the two wrote 7 songs for Anderssons 'BAO' 2011 album 'O Klang Och Jubeltid', performed as usual by vocalists Sjöholm, Körberg and Moreus. In July 2009, 'BAO' released their first international release, now named the Benny Andersson Band, with the album "The Story of a Heart". The album was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English, and the new title song premiered on BBC2's "Ken Bruce Show". A Swedish-language version of the title track, ""Sommaren Du Fick"" ("The Summer You Got"), was released as a single in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sjöholm. In May 2009, Andersson also released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> hotel "Hotel Rival", titled "<a href="2nd%20Best%20to%20None">2nd Best to None</a>", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work. In 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer <a href="Sissela%20Kyle">Sissela Kyle</a>, titled ""Jag vill bli gammal"" ("I Wanna Grow Old"), for her Stockholm stage show ""Your Days Are Numbered"", which was never recorded and released, but did get a TV performance. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track "Arrival" for <a href="Sarah%20Brightman">Sarah Brightman</a>'s cover version recorded for her 2008 album "<a href="Winter%20Symphony">Winter Symphony</a>". New English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song ""Innan Gryningen"" (then also named "Millennium Hymn"), with the new title "The Silence of the Dawn" for <a href="Barbara%20Dickson">Barbara Dickson</a> (performed live, but not yet recorded and released). In 2007, they wrote the new song ""Han som har vunnit allt"" ("He Who's Won It All") for actor/singer <a href="Anders%20Ekborg">Anders Ekborg</a>. Björn wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Benny's solo albums: "I Walk with You Mama" ("Stockholm by Night", 1989) and "After the Rain" ("Efter regnet", 1987) for opera singer <a href="Anne%20Sofie%20von%20Otter">Anne Sofie von Otter</a>, for her Andersson tribute album "I Let the Music Speak". <a href="Barbara%20Dickson">Barbara Dickson</a> recorded (but not yet released) a Björn & Benny song called "The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down"; the song eventually was released by Australian 'Mamma Mia!' musical star <a href="Anne%20Wood">Anne Wood</a> 201 album of ABBA covers, <a href="Divine%20Discontent">Divine Discontent</a>. As of October 2012, Björn Ulvaeus has mentioned writing new material with Benny for a 'BAO' Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO 'box'), and Benny is busy writing music for a Swedish language obscure musical, 'Hjälp Sökes' ('Help is Wanted') together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson, premiering 8 February 2013. Andersson has also written music for a documentary film about <a href="Olof%20Palme">Olof Palme</a>, re-recording the track 'Sorgmarch' from his last album throughout the film.

Both female members of ABBA pursued solo careers on the international scene after their work with the group. In 1982, Lyngstad chose <a href="Genesis%20%28band%29">Genesis</a> drummer and vocalist <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a> to produce the album "<a href="Something%27s%20Going%20On">Something's Going On</a>" and unveiled the hit single and video "<a href="I%20Know%20There%27s%20Something%20Going%20On">I Know There's Something Going On</a>" in August of that year. The single became a number-one hit in France (where it spent five weeks at the top), Belgium, Switzerland and Costa Rica. The track reached number-three in Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Poland, and was also a Top 10 hit in Germany, Italy, Finland, South Africa and Australia. The track also proved successful in the USA, peaking at No. 13 (and spending almost four months on the Billboard Hot 100). <a href="Sveriges%20Television">Sveriges Television</a> documented this historical event, by filming the whole recording process. The result became a one-hour TV documentary, including interviews with Lyngstad, Collins, Ulvaeus and Andersson as well as all the musicians. This documentary and the promotion videos from the album are included in "<a href="Frida%20%E2%80%93%20The%20DVD">Frida – The DVD</a>".

Lyngstad's second solo album after ABBA was called "<a href="Shine%20%28Frida%20album%29">Shine</a>", produced by <a href="Steve%20Lillywhite">Steve Lillywhite</a>. "Shine" was recorded in Paris and released in 1984. "Shine" was Lyngstad's final studio album release for twelve years. It featured "Slowly", the last known Andersson-Ulvaeus composition to have been recorded by one of the former female ABBA vocalists to date. The promotion videos and clips for "Shine" are included in "Frida – The DVD".

In 1980, Agnetha Fältskog recorded Nu tändas tusen juleljus (Now a thousand Christmas candles are lit), a Swedish Christmas album along with her 7-year-old daughter Linda. The album was released in 1981. Nu tändas tusen julejus, which was Fältskog's first Swedish language recording for the Polar Music label after having left CBS-Cupol, peaked at No. 6 on the Swedish album chart in January 1982, has been re-released on CD by Polar Music/PolyGram/Universal Music all through the 1990s and 2000s and is one of the best-selling Swedish Christmas albums of all time. The album name is derived from one of Scandinavia's best-known Christmas carols.

In 1983, Fältskog released the solo album "<a href="Wrap%20Your%20Arms%20Around%20Me">Wrap Your Arms Around Me</a>" which achieved platinum sales in Sweden. This included the single "The Heat Is On", which was a hit all over Europe and Scandinavia. It reached number-one in Sweden and Norway and number-two in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the United States, Fältskog earned a "Billboard" Top 30 hit with "Can't Shake Loose". In Europe, the single "Wrap Your Arms Around Me" was another successful hit, topping the charts in Belgium and Denmark, reaching the Top 5 in Sweden, the Netherlands and South Africa, and the Top 20 in Germany and France. The album sold 1.2 million copies worldwide. The album was produced by the highly successful producer and songwriter Mike Chapman, also known for his work with the Sweet, Mud, Suzi Quatro, Blondie, Pat Benatar and the Knack.

"It's So Nice to be Rich" was Agnetha's fourth top ten hit in Sweden in 1983. Her duet with Tomas Ledin, "Never Again" was the first one.

Fältskog's second English-language solo album, "<a href="Eyes%20of%20a%20Woman">Eyes of a Woman</a>", was released in March 1985, peaking at number-two in Sweden and another platinum seller and performing reasonably well in Europe. The album was produced by <a href="Eric%20Stewart">Eric Stewart</a> of <a href="10cc">10cc</a>. The first single from the album was her self-penned "I Won't Let You Go". Agnetha's duet with Ola Håkansson "The Way You Are" was a number-one hit in Sweden in 1986 and was awarded double platinum.

In early 1987, Agnetha recorded an album "Kom följ med I vår karusell" ('Come ride with me on my carousel') with her son Christian. The album contained songs for children and was sung in Swedish. For the album Agnetha recorded duets with her son and with a choir of children. She also recorded a few solo songs. The production was modern and fresh. The single 'Pa Sondag' was much played at the radio and even made the Swedish top 10, unique for a song made for kids to enjoy.

Also in November 1987, Fältskog released her third post-ABBA solo album, the <a href="Peter%20Cetera">Peter Cetera</a>-produced "<a href="I%20Stand%20Alone%20%28Agnetha%20F%C3%A4ltskog%20album%29">I Stand Alone</a>", which also included the "Billboard" Adult Contemporary duet with Cetera, "<a href="I%20Wasn%27t%20the%20One%20%28Who%20Said%20Goodbye%29">I Wasn't the One (Who Said Goodbye)</a>", as well as the European charting singles "The Last Time" and "Let It Shine". The album was extremely successful in Sweden, where it spent eight weeks at number-one and was awarded double-platinum. Shortly after some minor European promotion for the album in early 1988, Fältskog withdrew from public life and halted her music career. In 1996, she released her autobiography, "As I Am", and a compilation album featuring her solo hits alongside some ABBA classics.

In 2004, she made a successful comeback, when she released the critically acclaimed album "<a href="My%20Colouring%20Book">My Colouring Book</a>" containing 1960s covers who had the most impact on her teenage years as a music contender. It debuted at number-one in Sweden (achieving triple-platinum status), number-six in Germany, and number 12 in the UK, winning a silver award, and achieving gold status in Finland. The single "<a href="If%20I%20Thought%20You%27d%20Ever%20Change%20Your%20Mind">If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind</a>" (a cover of the Cilla Black 1960s song) became Fältskog's biggest solo hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number 11. The single peaked at number-two in Sweden and was a hit throughout Scandinavia and Europe. A further single, "<a href="When%20You%20Walk%20in%20the%20Room">When You Walk in the Room</a>", was released but met with less success, only peaking at number 34 in the United Kingdom. In January 2007, she sang a live duet on stage with Swedish singer Tommy Körberg at the after party for the final performance of the musical, "Mamma Mia!", in Stockholm, at which Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus were also present.

In 1992, Lyngstad had been asked and chosen to be the chairperson for the environmental organisation ""Artister för miljön"" (Artists for the Environment) in Sweden. She became chairperson for this organisation from 1992 to 1995. To mark her interests for the environment, she recorded the <a href="Julian%20Lennon">Julian Lennon</a> song "Saltwater" and performed it live in Stockholm. She arranged and financed summer camps for poor children in Sweden, focusing on environmental and ecological issues. Her environmental work for this organisation led up to the decision to record again. The album "<a href="Djupa%20andetag">Djupa andetag</a>" ("Deep Breaths") was released towards the end of 1996 and became a success in Sweden, where it reached number-one. The lyrics for the single from this album, "Även en blomma" ("Even a Flower"), deal with environmental issues. In 2004, Lyngstad recorded a song called "The Sun Will Shine Again", written especially for her and released with former <a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a> member <a href="Jon%20Lord">Jon Lord</a>. The couple made several TV performances with this song in Germany. Lyngstad lives a relatively low-profile life but occasionally appears at a party or charity function. On 26 August 1992, she married Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss von Plauen, of the German Reuss family. Reuss von Plauen died of <a href="lymphoma">lymphoma</a> in 1999 at the age of 49. In addition to losing her husband, Lyngstad had also lost her daughter Lise-Lotte in a car crash a year earlier.

On 5 December 2005, <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal</a> released her box set, <a href="Frida%20%E2%80%93%204xCD%201xDVD">Frida – 4xCD 1xDVD</a>, consisting of the solo albums she recorded for the Polar Label and the 3-hour documentary "Frida – The DVD". On this DVD, which covers her entire singing career, the viewer is guided by Lyngstad herself through the years from her TV debut in Sweden in 1967 to the TV performances she made in Germany in 2004. Many rare clips are included in the set and each performance is explained by Lyngstad herself. The interview with Lyngstad was filmed in the <a href="Swiss%20Alps">Swiss Alps</a> in mid-2005.

Lyngstad returned to the recording studio in 2010 to record vocals for the <a href="Cat%20Stevens">Cat Stevens</a> song "<a href="Morning%20Has%20Broken">Morning Has Broken</a>", for Swedish guitarist <a href="Georg%20Wadenius">Georg Wadenius</a>'s October 2010 album "Reconnection". The album, which featured other guest vocalists, reached number 17 in the Swedish charts.

In May 2013, Fältskog released a solo album entitled "<a href="A%20%28Agnetha%20F%C3%A4ltskog%20album%29">A</a>" through <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal International</a>. In a promotional interview, Fältskog explained that the album was unplanned and it was after she heard the first three songs that she felt that she "had to do this [record the album]". She also revealed that she completed singing lessons prior to recording "A", as she felt "a bit rusty" in her throat. Fältskog stated that she would not be undertaking any tours or live performances in support of the album, explaining: "I'm not that young anymore. I don’t have the energy to do that, and also I don’t want to travel too much." The title of the album was conceived of by the studio production team. "A" has been very successful, earning her 4 Gold Records in UK where it peaked at number-six, Australia, Germany and Sweden. In both UK and Australia it was in the top 100 albums of 2013.

The same year the members of ABBA went their separate ways, the French production of a "tribute" show (a children's TV musical named "<a href="Abbacadabra">Abbacadabra</a>" using 14 ABBA songs) spawned new interest in the group's music.

After receiving little attention during the mid-to-late-1980s, ABBA's music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK synth-pop duo <a href="Erasure">Erasure</a>, who released a cover <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> featuring versions of ABBA songs which topped the charts in 1992. As <a href="U2">U2</a> arrived in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> for a concert in June of that year, the band paid homage to ABBA by inviting Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to join them on stage for a rendition of "Dancing Queen", playing guitar and keyboards. September 1992 saw the release of "", a new compilation album. The single "<a href="Dancing%20Queen">Dancing Queen</a>" received radio airplay in the UK in the middle of 1992 to promote the album. The song returned to the Top 20 of the UK singles chart in August that year, this time peaking at number 16.

The enormous interest in the "ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits" compilation saw the release of "" in 1993.

In 1994, two Australian <a href="cult%20film">cult film</a>s caught the attention of the world's media, both focusing on admiration for ABBA: "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Priscilla%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Desert">The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</a>" and "<a href="Muriel%27s%20Wedding">Muriel's Wedding</a>". The same year, "<a href="Thank%20You%20for%20the%20Music%20%28album%29">Thank You for the Music</a>", a four-disc box set comprising all the group's hits and stand-out album tracks, was released with the involvement of all four members. "By the end of the twentieth century", American critic <a href="Chuck%20Klosterman">Chuck Klosterman</a> wrote a decade later, "it was far more contrarian to hate ABBA than to love them."

ABBA were soon recognised and embraced by other acts: <a href="Evan%20Dando">Evan Dando</a> of <a href="the%20Lemonheads">the Lemonheads</a> recorded a cover version of "<a href="Knowing%20Me%2C%20Knowing%20You">Knowing Me, Knowing You</a>"; <a href="Sin%C3%A9ad%20O%27Connor">Sinéad O'Connor</a> and Boyzone's <a href="Stephen%20Gately">Stephen Gately</a> have recorded "<a href="Chiquitita">Chiquitita</a>"; <a href="Tanita%20Tikaram">Tanita Tikaram</a>, <a href="Blancmange%20%28band%29">Blancmange</a> and <a href="Steven%20Wilson">Steven Wilson</a> paid tribute to "<a href="The%20Day%20Before%20You%20Came">The Day Before You Came</a>". <a href="Cliff%20Richard">Cliff Richard</a> covered "<a href="Lay%20All%20Your%20Love%20on%20Me">Lay All Your Love on Me</a>", while <a href="Dionne%20Warwick">Dionne Warwick</a>, Peter Cetera, and <a href="Celebrity%20Skin%20%28band%29">Celebrity Skin</a> recorded their versions of "<a href="SOS%20%28ABBA%20song%29">SOS</a>". U.S. alternative-rock musician Marshall Crenshaw has also been known to play a version of "Knowing Me, Knowing You" in concert appearances, while legendary English <a href="Latin%20pop">Latin pop</a> songwriter <a href="Richard%20Daniel%20Roman">Richard Daniel Roman</a> has recognized ABBA as a major influence. Swedish metal guitarist <a href="Yngwie%20Malmsteen">Yngwie Malmsteen</a> covered "<a href="Gimme%21%20Gimme%21%20Gimme%21%20%28A%20Man%20After%20Midnight%29">Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)</a>" with slightly altered lyrics.

Two different compilation albums of ABBA songs have been released. "ABBA: A Tribute" coincided with the 25th anniversary celebration and featured 17 songs, some of which were recorded especially for this release. Notable tracks include Go West's "One of Us", Army of Lovers "<a href="Hasta%20Ma%C3%B1ana">Hasta Mañana</a>", Information Society's "Lay All Your Love on Me", Erasure's "Take a Chance on Me" (with <a href="MC%20Kinky">MC Kinky</a>), and Lyngstad's a cappella duet with the Real Group of "Dancing Queen". A second 12-track album was released in 1999, entitled "<a href="ABBAmania">ABBAmania</a>", with proceeds going to the Youth Music charity in England. It featured all new cover versions: notable tracks were by Madness ("Money, Money, Money"), <a href="Culture%20Club">Culture Club</a> ("Voulez-Vous"), <a href="the%20Corrs">the Corrs</a> ("The Winner Takes It All"), Steps ("Lay All Your Love on Me", "I Know Him So Well"), and a medley entitled "Thank ABBA for the Music" performed by several artists and as featured on the Brits Awards that same year.

In 1997, an ABBA tribute group was formed, the ABBA Teens, which was subsequently renamed the <a href="A-Teens">A-Teens</a> to allow the group some independence. The group's first album, "<a href="The%20ABBA%20Generation">The ABBA Generation</a>", consisting solely of ABBA covers reimagined as 1990s pop songs, was a worldwide success and so were subsequent albums. The group disbanded in 2004 due to a grueling schedule and intentions to go solo.

In Sweden, the growing recognition of the legacy of Andersson and Ulvaeus resulted in the 1998 "B & B Concerts", a tribute concert (with Swedish singers who had worked with the songwriters through the years) showcasing not only their ABBA years, but hits both before and after ABBA. The concert was a success, and was ultimately released on CD. It later toured Scandinavia and even went to Beijing in the People's Republic of China for two concerts.

In 2000, ABBA was reported to have turned down an offer of approximately US$1,000,000,000 (one billion US dollars) to do a reunion tour consisting of 100 concerts.

For the 2004 semi-final of the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, staged in Istanbul 30 years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, all four members made cameo appearances in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled "Our Last Video Ever". Other well-known stars such as <a href="Rik%20Mayall">Rik Mayall</a>, <a href="Cher">Cher</a> and <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>'s <a href="Eddie%20the%20Head">Eddie</a> also made appearances in the video. It was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release, retitled "The Last Video" at the request of the former ABBA members.

In 2005, all four members of ABBA appeared at the Stockholm premiere of the musical "Mamma Mia!".

On 22 October 2005, at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest, "<a href="Waterloo%20%28ABBA%20song%29">Waterloo</a>" was chosen as the best song in the competition's history.

On 4 July 2008, all four ABBA members were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the film "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28film%29">Mamma Mia!</a>". It was only the second time all of them had appeared together in public since 1986. During the appearance, they re-emphasized that they intended never to officially reunite, citing the opinion of <a href="Robert%20Plant">Robert Plant</a> that the re-formed <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> was more like a <a href="cover%20band">cover band</a> of itself than the original band. Ulvaeus stated that he wanted the band to be remembered as they were during the peak years of their success.

The compilation album "", originally released in 1992, returned to number-one in the UK album charts for the fifth time on 3 August 2008. On 14 August 2008, the "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28film%29">Mamma Mia! The Movie</a>" film soundtrack went to number-one on the US "Billboard" charts, ABBA's first US chart-topping album. During the band's heyday the highest album chart position they had ever achieved in America was number 14.

In November 2008, all eight studio albums, together with a ninth of rare tracks, was released as "<a href="The%20Albums">The Albums</a>". It hit several charts, peaking at number-four in Sweden and reaching the Top 10 in several other European territories.

In 2008, <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> Europe, in collaboration with <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a> Sweden AB, released "<a href="List%20of%20SingStar%20titles">SingStar ABBA</a>" on both the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> games consoles, as part of the <a href="SingStar">SingStar</a> music video games. The PS2 version features 20 ABBA songs, while 25 songs feature on the PS3 version.

On 22 January 2009, Fältskog and Lyngstad appeared together on stage to receive the Swedish music award ""Rockbjörnen"" (for "lifetime achievement"). In an interview, the two women expressed their gratitude for the honorary award and thanked their fans.

On 25 November 2009, <a href="PRS%20for%20Music">PRS for Music</a> announced that the British public voted ABBA as the band they would most like to see re-form.

On 27 January 2010, ABBAWORLD, a 25-room touring exhibition featuring interactive and audiovisual activities, debuted at <a href="Earls%20Court%20Exhibition%20Centre">Earls Court Exhibition Centre</a> in London. According to the exhibition's website, ABBAWORLD is "approved and fully supported" by the band members.

"Mamma Mia" was released as one of the first few non-premium song selections for the online RPG game "Bandmaster". On 17 May 2011, "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!" was added as a non-premium song selection for the Bandmaster Philippines server. On 15 November 2011, <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> released a <a href="dancing%20game">dancing game</a> called "" for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>.

In January 2012, Universal Music announced the re-release of ABBA's final album "The Visitors", featuring a previously unheard track "From a Twinkling Star to a Passing Angel".

A book entitled "ABBA: The Official Photo Book" was published in early 2014 to mark the 40-year anniversary of the band's Eurovision victory. The book reveals that part of the reason for the band's outrageous costumes were the Swedish tax laws at the time that allowed the cost of <a href="wikt%3Abrazen">brazen</a> outfits that were not suitable for public display to be deducted against Tax.

A sequel to the 2008 movie "Mamma Mia!", titled "Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again!", was announced on 20 May 2017 and is expected to be released on 20 July 2018.

In June 2017, a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> outside Brighton Dome was set to commemorate their 1974 Eurovision win.

ABBA were perfectionists in the studio, working on tracks until they got them right rather than leaving them to come back later on.
The band created a basic rhythm track with a drummer, guitarist and bass player, and overlaid other arrangements and instruments. Vocals were then added, and orchestra <a href="overdubbing">overdubs</a> were usually left until last.

Agnetha and Frida contributed ideas at the studio stage. Benny and Björn played them in the backing tracks and they made comments and suggestions. According to Agnetha, she and Frida had the final say in how the lyrics were shaped. -- "When we gather around the piano to get our voices tuned up, we often come up with things we can use in the backing vocals." After vocals and overdubs were done, the band took up to five days to mix a song.

ABBA was widely noted for the colourful and trend-setting costumes its members wore. The reason for the wild costumes was Swedish tax law. The cost of the clothes was deductible only if they could not be worn other than for performances. Choreography by <a href="Graham%20Tainton">Graham Tainton</a> also contributed to their performance style.

The videos that accompanied some of the band's biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre. Most of ABBA's videos (and "ABBA: The Movie") were directed by <a href="Lasse%20Hallstr%C3%B6m">Lasse Hallström</a>, who would later direct the films "<a href="My%20Life%20as%20a%20Dog">My Life as a Dog</a>", "<a href="The%20Cider%20House%20Rules%20%28film%29">The Cider House Rules</a>" and "<a href="Chocolat%20%282000%20film%29">Chocolat</a>".

ABBA made videos because their songs were hits in many different countries and personal appearances were not always possible. This was also done in an effort to minimize travelling, particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights. Fältskog and Ulvaeus had two young children and Fältskog, who was also <a href="Fear%20of%20flying">afraid of flying</a>, was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time. ABBA's manager, Stig Anderson, realized the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicize a single or album, thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour. Some of these videos became classics because of the 1970s-era costumes and early video effects, such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs, overlapping one singer's profile with the other's full face, and the contrasting of one member against another.

In 1976, ABBA participated in a high-profile advertising campaign by the Matsushita Electric Industrial (today's <a href="Panasonic">Panasonic</a>), which was designed to promote the brand <a href="National%20%28brand%29">National</a>. This campaign was designed initially for Australia, where "National" was still the primary brand used by Matsushita, who had not introduced the "<a href="Panasonic">Panasonic</a>" brand to Australia yet despite its widespread use in other parts of the world. However, the campaign was also aired in Japan. Five commercials, each approximately one minute long, were produced, each using the "<a href="National%20%28brand%29">National</a> Song" sung by ABBA, which used the melody and instrumental arrangement of "<a href="Fernando%20%28song%29">Fernando</a>", adapted with new lyrics promoting National, and working in several slogans used by National in their advertising.

In September 2010, band members Andersson and Ulvaeus criticized the right-wing <a href="Danish%20People%27s%20Party">Danish People's Party</a> (DF) for using the ABBA song "Mamma Mia" (with modified lyrics) at rallies. The band threatened to file a lawsuit against the DF, saying they never allowed their music to be used politically and that they had absolutely no interest in supporting the party. Their record label Universal Music later said that no legal action would be taken because an agreement had been reached.

During their active career, from 1972 to 1982, ABBA placed twenty singles on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, fourteen of which made the top 40 (13 on the Cashbox Top 100) and ten of which made the Top 20 on both charts. A total of four of those singles reached the Top 10, including "Dancing Queen" which reached number-one in April 1977. While "Fernando" and "SOS" did not break the Top 10 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, reaching number 13 and 15 respectively, they did reach the Top 10 on Cashbox ("Fernando") and Record World ("SOS") charts. Both "Dancing Queen" and "Take A Chance On Me" were certified gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> for sales of over one million copies each.

The group also had 12 Top 20 singles on the "Billboard" Adult Contemporary chart with two of them, "Fernando" and "The Winner Takes It All", reaching number-one. "Lay All Your Love on Me" was ABBA's fourth number-one single on a "Billboard" chart, topping the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The singles "Dancing Queen" and "Take a Chance on Me" were certified gold (more than 1 million copies sold) by the RIAA.

Nine ABBA albums made their way into the top half of the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> album chart, with seven of them reaching the Top 50 and four reaching the Top 20. "ABBA: The Album" was the highest-charting album of the group's career, peaking at No. 14. Five albums received RIAA gold certification (more than 500,000 copies sold), while three acquired platinum status (selling more than one million copies). 

The album, More Abba Gold, was released in the United States in 1993. It topped the Billboard Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in August, 2008, being the group’s first number one album ever on any of the Billboard album charts. It sold 7x Platinum (1x Platinum = one million copies). It contains the previously unreleased single, I Am the City.

On 15 March 2010, ABBA were inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> by <a href="Bee%20Gees">Bee Gees</a> members <a href="Barry%20Gibb">Barry Gibb</a> and <a href="Robin%20Gibb">Robin Gibb</a>. The ceremony was held at the <a href="Waldorf%20Astoria%20Hotel">Waldorf Astoria Hotel</a> in New York City. The group was represented by Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Benny Andersson.

Allegiance

An allegiance is a duty of fidelity said to be owed, or freely committed, by the people, <a href="British%20subject">subjects</a> or <a href="citizen">citizen</a>s to their <a href="state%20%28polity%29">state</a> or <a href="Monarch">sovereign</a>.

From Middle English "ligeaunce" (see medieval Latin "ligeantia", "a liegance"). The "al-" prefix was probably added through confusion with another legal term, "allegeance", an "allegation" (the French "allegeance" comes from the English). "Allegiance" is formed from "liege," from <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "liege", "liege, free", of Germanic origin. The connection with <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "ligare", "to bind," is erroneous.

Traditionally, English legal commentators used the term "allegiance" in two ways. In one sense, it referred to the deference which anyone, even foreigners, were expected to pay to the institutions of the country where one lived. In the other sense, it meant national character and the subjection due to that character.


The English doctrine, which was at one time adopted in the United States, asserted that allegiance was indelible: "Nemo potest exuere patriam". As the law stood prior to 1870, every person who by birth or <a href="naturalisation">naturalisation</a> satisfied the conditions set forth, (though he should be removed in infancy to another country where his family resided), owed an allegiance to the British crown which he/she could never resign or lose, except by act of parliament or by the recognition of the independence or the cession of the portion of British territory in which he resided.

This refusal to accept any <a href="Renunciation%20of%20citizenship">renunciation</a> of allegiance to the Crown led to conflict with the United States over <a href="impressment">impressment</a>, which led to further conflicts during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, when thirteen Irish American <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> were executed as <a href="traitor">traitor</a>s after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Queenston%20Heights">Battle of Queenston Heights</a>; <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> urged American <a href="reprisal">reprisal</a>, but none was carried out.

Allegiance is the tie which binds the subject to the <a href="Monarch">Sovereign</a> in return for that protection which the Sovereign affords the subject. It was the mutual bond and obligation between monarch and subjects, whereby subjects are called his liege subjects, because they are bound to obey and serve him; and he is called their liege lord, because he should maintain and defend them ("Ex parte Anderson" (1861) 3 El & El 487; 121 ER 525; "China Navigation Co v Attorney-General" (1932) 48 TLR 375; "Attorney-General v Nissan" [1969] 1 All ER 629; "<a href="Oppenheimer%20v%20Cattermole">Oppenheimer v Cattermole</a>" [1972] 3 All ER 1106). The duty of the Crown towards its subjects is to govern and protect. The reciprocal duty of the subject towards the Crown is that of allegiance.

At common law allegiance is a true and faithful obedience of the subject due to his Sovereign. As the subject owes to his king his true and faithful allegiance and obedience, so the Sovereign


Natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for parte Anderson (1861) 3 El & El 487; 121 ER 525). Natural-born subjects owe allegiance wherever they may be. Where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country ("R v Vermaak" (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)).

Allegiance is owed both to the Sovereign as a natural person and to the Sovereign in the political capacity ("Re Stepney Election Petition, Isaacson v Durant" (1886) 17 QBD 54 (per <a href="John%20Coleridge%2C%201st%20Baron%20Coleridge">Lord Coleridge</a> CJ)). Attachment to the person of the reigning Sovereign is not sufficient. Loyalty requires affection also to the office of the Sovereign, attachment to royalty, attachment to the law and to the constitution of the realm, and he who would, by force or by fraud, endeavour to prostrate that law and constitution, though he may retain his affection for its head, can boast but an imperfect and spurious species of loyalty ("R v O'Connell" (1844) 7 ILR 261).

There were four kinds of allegiances ("Rittson v Stordy" (1855) 3 Sm & G 230; "De Geer v Stone" (1882) 22 Ch D 243; "Isaacson v Durant" (1886) 54 LT 684; "Gibson, Gavin v Gibson" [1913] 3 KB 379; "Joyce v DPP" [1946] AC 347; "Collingwood v Pace" (1661) O Bridg 410; "Lane v Bennett" (1836) 1 M & W 70; "Lyons Corp v East India Co" (1836) 1 Moo PCC 175; "Birtwhistle v Vardill" (1840) 7 Cl & Fin 895; "R v Lopez, R v Sattler" (1858) Dears & B 525; Ex p Brown (1864) 5 B & S 280);

(a) "Ligeantia naturalis, absoluta, pura et indefinita", and this originally is due by nature and birthright, and is called "alta ligeantia", and those that owe this are called "subditus natus";

(b) "Ligeantia acquisita", not by nature but by acquisition or denization, being called a denizen, or rather denizon, because they are "subditus datus";

(c) "Ligeantia localis", by operation of law, when a friendly alien enters the country, because so long as they are in the country they are within the Sovereign's protection, therefore they owe the Sovereign a local obedience or allegiance ("R v Cowle" (1759) 2 Burr 834; "Low v Routledge" (1865) 1 Ch App 42; "Re Johnson, Roberts v Attorney-General" [1903] 1 Ch 821; "Tingley v Muller" [1917] 2 Ch 144; "Rodriguez v Speyer" [1919] AC 59; "Johnstone v Pedlar" [1921] 2 AC 262; "R v Tucker" (1694) Show Parl Cas 186; "R v Keyn" (1876) 2 Ex D 63; "Re Stepney Election Petn, Isaacson v Durant" (1886) 17 QBD 54);

(d) A legal obedience, where a particular law requires the taking of an oath of allegiance by subject or alien alike.

Natural allegiance was acquired by birth within the Sovereign's dominions (except for the issue of diplomats or of invading forces or of an alien in enemy occupied territory). The natural allegiance and obedience is an incident inseparable to every subject, for as soon as they are born they owe by birthright allegiance and obedience to the Sovereign ("Ex p. Anderson" (1861) 3 E & E 487). A natural-born subject owes allegiance wherever they may be, so that where territory is occupied in the course of hostilities by an enemy's force, even if the annexation of the occupied country is proclaimed by the enemy, there can be no change of allegiance during the progress of hostilities on the part of a citizen of the occupied country ("R v Vermaak" (1900) 21 NLR 204 (South Africa)).

Acquired allegiance was acquired by naturalisation or denization. Denization, or "ligeantia acquisita", appears to be threefold ("Thomas v Sorrel" (1673) 3 Keb 143);


Local allegiance was due by an alien while in the protection of the Crown. All friendly resident aliens incurred all the obligations of subjects ("The Angelique" (1801) 3 Ch Rob App 7). An alien, coming into a colony also became, temporarily a subject of the Crown, and acquired rights both within and beyond the colony, and these latter rights could not be affected by the laws of that colony ("Routledge v Low" (1868) LR 3 HL 100; 37 LJ Ch 454; 18 LT 874; 16 WR 1081, HL; "Reid v Maxwell" (1886) 2 TLR 790; "Falcon v Famous Players Film Co" [1926] 2 KB 474).

A resident alien owed allegiance even when the protection of the Crown was withdrawn owing to the occupation of an enemy, because the absence of the Crown's protection was temporary and involuntary ("de Jager v Attorney-Geneneral of Natal" [1907] AC 326).

Legal allegiance was due when an alien took an oath of allegiance required for a particular office under the Crown.

By the <a href="Naturalisation%20Act%201870">Naturalisation Act 1870</a>, it was made possible for British subjects to renounce their nationality and allegiance, and the ways in which that nationality is lost are defined. So British subjects voluntarily naturalized in a foreign state are deemed aliens from the time of such naturalization, unless, in the case of persons naturalized before the passing of the act, they have declared their desire to remain British subjects within two years from the passing of the act. Persons who from having been born within British territory are British subjects, but who at birth became under the law of any foreign state subjects of such state, and also persons who though born abroad are British subjects by reason of parentage, may by declarations of alienage get rid of British nationality. Emigration to an uncivilized country leaves British nationality unaffected: indeed the right claimed by all states to follow with their authority their subjects so emigrating is one of the usual and recognized means of <a href="Colonialism">colonial</a> expansion.

The doctrine that no man can cast off his native allegiance without the consent of his sovereign was early abandoned in the United States, and <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="John%20Rutledge">John Rutledge</a> also declared in <a href="Talbot%20v.%20Janson">Talbot v. Janson</a>, "a man may, at the same time, enjoy the rights of citizenship under two governments." On July 27, 1868, the day before the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> was adopted, <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Congress</a> declared in the preamble of the <a href="Expatriation%20Act%20of%201868">Expatriation Act</a> that "the right of <a href="expatriation">expatriation</a> is a natural and inherent right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," and (Section I) one of "the fundamental principles of this government" (<a href="United%20States%20Revised%20Statutes">United States Revised Statutes</a>, sec. 1999). Every natural-born citizen of a foreign state who is also an American citizen and every natural-born American citizen who is a citizen of a foreign land owes a double allegiance, one to the United States, and one to his homeland (in the event of an immigrant becoming a citizen of the US), or to his adopted land (in the event of an emigrant natural born citizen of the US becoming a citizen of another nation). If these allegiances come into conflict, he or she may be guilty of treason against one or both. If the demands of these two sovereigns upon his duty of allegiance come into conflict, those of the United States have the paramount authority in American law; likewise, those of the foreign land have paramount authority in their legal system. In such a situation, it may be incumbent on the individual to <a href="Renunciation%20of%20citizenship">renounce</a> one of his citizenships to avoid possibly being forced into situations where countervailing duties are required of him, such as might occur in the event of war.

The oath of allegiance is an <a href="oath">oath</a> of fidelity to the sovereign taken by all persons holding important public office and as a condition of naturalization. By ancient common law it might be required of all persons above the age of 12, and it was repeatedly used as a test for the disaffected. In England it was first imposed by statute in the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a> (1558) and its form has more than once been altered since. Up to the time of the revolution the promise was, "to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene <a href="honour">honour</a>, and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him without defending him therefrom." This was thought to favour the doctrine of absolute non-resistance, and accordingly the convention parliament enacted the form that has been in use since that time – "I do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty ..."

In United States and some other republics, the oath is known as the Pledge of Allegiance. Instead of declaring fidelity to a monarch, the pledge is made to the flag, the republic, and to the core values of the country, specifically <a href="liberty">liberty</a> and <a href="justice">justice</a>. The reciting of the pledge in the United States is <a href="Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%23Legal%20challenges">voluntary</a> because of the rights guaranteed to the people under the <a href="First%20Amendment">First Amendment</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.

The word used in the Arabic language for allegiance is "bay'at" (Arabic: بيعة), which means "taking hand". The practice is sanctioned in the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> by Surah 48:10: "Verily, those who give thee their allegiance, they give it but to Allah Himself". The word is used for the <a href="oath">oath</a> of allegiance to an <a href="emir">emir</a>. It is also used for the initiation ceremony specific to many <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> orders.

MessagePad

The MessagePad is the first series of <a href="personal%20digital%20assistant">personal digital assistant</a> devices developed by <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Computer</a> for the <a href="Newton%20%28platform%29">Newton platform</a> in 1993. Some electronic engineering and the manufacture of Apple's MessagePad devices was undertaken in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> by the <a href="Sharp%20Corporation">Sharp Corporation</a>. The devices were based on the <a href="ARM%20architecture">ARM</a> 610 <a href="RISC%20processor">RISC processor</a> and all featured <a href="handwriting%20recognition">handwriting recognition</a> software and were developed and marketed by Apple. The devices ran the <a href="Newton%20OS">Newton OS</a>.

With the MessagePad 120 with <a href="Newton%20OS">Newton OS</a> 2.0, the Newton Keyboard by Apple became available, which can also be used via the dongle on Newton devices with a Newton InterConnect port, most notably the Apple MessagePad 2000/2100 series, as well as the Apple <a href="eMate%20300">eMate 300</a>.

Newton devices featuring Newton OS 2.1 or higher can be used with the screen turned horizontally ("landscape") as well as vertically ("portrait"). A change of a setting rotates the contents of the display by 90, 180 or 270 degrees. Handwriting recognition still works properly with the display rotated, although display calibration is needed when rotation in any direction is used for the first time or when the Newton device is reset.

In initial versions (Newton OS 1.x) the handwriting recognition gave extremely mixed results for users and was sometimes inaccurate. The original handwriting recognition engine was called Calligrapher, and was licensed from a Russian company called Paragraph International. Calligrapher's design was quite sophisticated; it attempted to learn the user's natural handwriting, using a database of known words to make guesses as to what the user was writing, and could interpret writing anywhere on the screen, whether hand-printed, in <a href="cursive">cursive</a>, or a mix of the two. By contrast, <a href="Palm%20Pilot">Palm Pilot's</a> Graffiti had a less sophisticated design than Calligrapher, but was sometimes found to be more accurate and precise due to its reliance on a fixed, predefined stroke alphabet. The stroke alphabet used letter shapes which resembled standard handwriting, but which were modified to be both simple and very easy to differentiate. <a href="Palm%2C%20Inc.">Palm Computing</a> also released two versions of Graffiti for Newton devices. Ironically, the Newton version sometimes performed better and could also show strokes as they were being written as input was done on the display itself, rather than on a silkscreen area.

For editing text, Newton had a very intuitive system for handwritten editing, such as scratching out words to be deleted, circling text to be selected, or using written <a href="caret">caret</a>s to mark inserts.

Later releases of the <a href="Newton%20OS">Newton operating system</a> retained the original recognizer for compatibility, but added a hand-printed-text-only (not <a href="cursive">cursive</a>) recognizer, called "<a href="Rosetta%20%28Newton%29">Rosetta</a>", which was developed by Apple, included in version 2.0 of the <a href="Newton%20OS">Newton operating system</a>, and refined in Newton 2.1. Rosetta is generally considered a significant improvement and many reviewers, testers, and most users consider the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition software better than any of the alternatives even 10 years after it was introduced. Recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas such as "1 + 2 =" was also under development but never released. However, users wrote similar programs which could evaluate mathematical formulas using the Newton OS Intelligent Assistant, a unique part of every Newton device.

The handwriting recognition and parts of the user interface for the Newton are best understood in the context of the broad history of <a href="Pen%20computing">Pen computing</a>, which is quite extensive.

A vital feature of the Newton handwriting recognition system is the <a href="modeless">modeless</a> <a href="Error%20detection%20and%20correction">error correction</a>. That is, correction done <a href="in%20situ">in situ</a> without using a separate window or widget, using a minimum of gestures. If a word is recognized improperly, the user could double-tap the word and a list of alternatives would pop up in a menu under the stylus. Most of the time, the correct word will be in the list. If not, a button at the bottom of the list allows the user to edit individual characters in that word. Other pen gestures could do such things as transpose letters (also <a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>). The correction popup also allowed the user to revert to the original, un-recognized letter shapes - this would be useful in note-taking scenarios if there was insufficient time to make corrections immediately. To conserve memory and storage space, alternative recognition hypotheses would not be saved indefinitely. If the user returned to a note a week later, for example, they would only see the best match. Error correction in many current handwriting systems provides such functionality but adds more steps to the process, greatly increasing the interruption to a user's workflow that a given correction requires.

Text could also be entered by tapping with the stylus on a small on-screen pop-up <a href="QWERTY">QWERTY</a> <a href="virtual%20keyboard">virtual keyboard</a>, although more layouts were developed by users. Newton devices could also accept free-hand "Sketches", "Shapes", and "Ink Text", much like a desktop computer <a href="graphics%20tablet">graphics tablet</a>. With "Shapes", Newton could recognize that the user was attempting to draw a circle, a line, a <a href="polygon">polygon</a>, etc., and it would clean them up into perfect <a href="vector%20graphics">vector</a> representations (with modifiable control points and defined vertices) of what the user was attempting to draw. "Shapes" and "Sketches" could be <a href="image%20scaling">scaled</a> or deformed once drawn. "Ink text" captured the user's free-hand writing but allowed it to be treated somewhat like recognized text when manipulating for later editing purposes ("ink text" supported <a href="word%20wrap">word wrap</a>, could be formatted to be bold, italic, etc.). At any time a user could also direct their Newton device to recognize selected "ink text" and turn it into recognized text (deferred recognition). A Newton note (or the notes attached to each contact in Names and each Dates calendar or to-do event) could contain any mix of interleaved text, Ink Text, Shapes, and Sketches.

While the Newton offered handwriting recognition training and would clean up sketches into vector shapes, both were unreliable and required much rewriting and redrawing. The most reliable application of the Newton was collecting and organizing address and phone numbers. While handwritten messages could be stored, they could not be easily filed, sorted or searched. While the technology was a probable cause for the failure of the device (which otherwise met or exceeded expectations), the technology has been instrumental in producing the future generation of handwriting software that realizes the potential and promise that began in the development of Newton-Apple's Ink Handwriting Recognition.

The MessagePad 100 series of devices used Macintosh's proprietary <a href="serial%20port">serial port</a>s—round <a href="Mini-DIN%20connector">Mini-DIN 8 connectors</a>. The MessagePad 2000/2100 models (as well as the eMate 300) have a small, proprietary "Newton InterConnect" port. However, the development of the <a href="Newton%20%28platform%29">Newton hardware/software platform</a> was canceled by <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> on February 27, 1998, so the InterConnect port, while itself very advanced, can only be used to connect a serial dongle. A prototype multi-purpose InterConnect device containing serial, audio in, audio out, and other ports was also discovered. In addition, all Newton devices have <a href="infrared">infrared</a> connectivity, initially only the Sharp <a href="Amplitude-shift%20keying">ASK</a> protocol, but later also <a href="IrDA">IrDA</a>, though the Sharp ASK protocol was kept in for compatibility reasons. Unlike the Palm Pilot, all Newton devices are equipped with a standard <a href="PC%20Card">PC Card</a> expansion slot (two on the 2000/2100). This allows native modem and even <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> connectivity; Newton users have also written <a href="device%20driver">drivers</a> for <a href="802.11b">802.11b</a> wireless networking cards and ATA-type <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> cards (including the popular <a href="CompactFlash">CompactFlash</a> format), as well as for <a href="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> cards. Newton can also dial a phone number through the built-in speaker of the Newton device by simply holding a telephone handset up to the speaker and transmitting the appropriate tones. Fax and printing support is also built in at the operating system level, although it requires peripherals such as parallel adapters, PCMCIA cards, or serial modems, the most notable of which is the lightweight Newton Fax Modem released by Apple in 1993. It is powered by 2 AA batteries, and can also be used with a power adapter. It provides data transfer at 2400 bit/s, and can also send and receive fax messages at 9600 and 4800 bit/s respectively.

The original Apple MessagePad and MessagePad 100 used four <a href="AAA%20battery">AAA batteries</a>. They were eventually replaced by AA batteries with the release of the Apple MessagePad 110.

The use of 4 <a href="AA%20battery">AA</a> <a href="NiCd">NiCd</a> (MessagePad 110, 120 and 130) and 4x AA <a href="NiMH">NiMH</a> cells (MP2x00 series, <a href="eMate%20300">eMate 300</a>) give a runtime of up to 30 hours (MP2100 with two 20 MB <a href="Linear%20Flash">Linear Flash</a> memory <a href="PC%20Card">PC Card</a>s, no backlight usage) and up to 24 hours with backlight on. While adding more weight to the handheld Newton devices than AAA batteries or custom battery packs, the choice of an easily replaceable/rechargeable cell format gives the user a still unsurpassed runtime and flexibility of power supply. This, together with the <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> used as internal storage starting with the Apple MessagePad 120 (if all cells lost their power, no data was lost due to the non-volatility of this storage), gave birth to the slogan "Newton never dies, it only gets new batteries".

The Apple MessagePad 2000/2100, with a vastly improved handwriting recognition system, 162 MHz <a href="StrongARM">StrongARM</a> SA-110 <a href="RISC">RISC</a> processor, Newton OS 2.1, and a better, clearer, backlit screen, attracted critical plaudits. 
Apple and third parties marketed several "wallets" (cases) for the handheld Newton devices, which would hold them securely along with the owner's credit cards, driver's license, business cards, and cash. Most also protected the LCD screen. 

Fourteen months after Sculley demoed it at the May 1992, Chicago CES, the MessagePad was first offered for sale on August 2, 1993, at the Boston <a href="Macworld/iWorld">Macworld Expo</a>. The hottest item at the show, it cost $900. 50,000 MessagePads were sold in the device’s first three months on the market.

The original Apple MessagePad and MessagePad 100 were limited by the very short lifetime of their inadequate AAA batteries.
Critics also panned the <a href="handwriting%20recognition">handwriting recognition</a> that was available in the debut models, which had been trumpeted in the Newton's marketing campaign. It was this problem that was skewered in the "<a href="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a>" comic strips in which a written text entry is (erroneously) translated as "Egg Freckles?", as well as in the animated series "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>". However, the word 'freckles' was not included in the Newton dictionary, although a user could add it themselves. Difficulties were in part caused by the long time requirements for the Calligrapher handwriting recognition software to "learn" the user's handwriting; this process could take from two weeks to two months.

Another factor which limited the early Newton devices' appeal was that desktop connectivity was not included in the basic retail package, a problem that was later solved with 2.x Newton devices - these were bundled with a serial cable and the appropriate Newton Connection Utilities software.

Later versions of Newton OS offered improved handwriting recognition, quite possibly a leading reason for the continued popularity of the devices among Newton users. Even given the age of the hardware and software, Newtons still demand a sale price on the used market far greater than that of comparatively aged PDAs produced by other companies. In 2006 <a href="CNET">CNET</a> compared an Apple MessagePad 2000 to a <a href="Samsung%20Q1">Samsung Q1</a>, and the Newton was declared better. In 2009, <a href="CNET">CNET</a> compared an Apple MessagePad 2000 to an <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a>, and the Newton was still declared better.

A chain of dedicated Newton only stores called Newton Source existed from 1994 until 1998. Locations included New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Boston. The Westwood Village, California, near U.C.L.A. featured the trademark red and yellow lightbulb Newton logo in neon. The stores provided an informative educational venue to learn about the Newton platform in a hands on relaxed fashion. The stores had no traditional computer retail counters and featured oval desktops where interested users could become intimately involved with the Newton product range. The stores were a model for the later Apple Stores. 

Notes: The eMate 300 actually has ROM chips silk screened with 2.2 on them. Stephanie Mak on her website discusses this:
If one removes all patches to the eMate 300 (by replacing the ROM chip, and then putting in the original one again, as the eMate and the MessagePad 2000/2100 devices erase their memory completely after replacing the chip), the result will be the Newton OS saying that this is version 2.2.00. Also, the Original MessagePad and the MessagePad 100 share the same model number, as they only differ in the ROM chip version. (The OMP has OS versions 1.0 to 1.05, or 1.10 to 1.11, while the MP100 has 1.3 that can be upgraded with various patches.)

There were a number of projects that used the Newton as a portable information device in cultural settings such as museums. For example, Visible Interactive created a walking tour in San Francisco's Chinatown but the most significant effort took place in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> at the <a href="Petronas">Petronas</a> Discovery Center, known as Petrosains.

In 1995, an exhibit design firm, DMCD Inc., was awarded the contract to design a new science museum in the <a href="Petronas%20Towers">Petronas Towers</a> in Kuala Lumpur. A major factor in the award was the concept that visitors would use a Newton device to access additional information, find out where they were in the museum, listen to audio, see animations, control robots and other media, and to bookmark information for printout at the end of the exhibit.

The device became known as the ARIF, a Malay word for "wise man" or "seer" and it was also an acronym for A Resourceful Informative Friend. Some 400 ARIFS were installed and over 300 are still in use today. The development of the ARIF system was extremely complex and required a team of hardware and software engineers, designers, and writers. ARIF is an ancestor of the PDA systems used in museums today and it boasted features that have not been attempted since.

The Newton was also used in healthcare applications, for example in collecting data directly from patients. Newtons were used as electronic diaries, with patients entering their symptoms and other information concerning their health status on a daily basis. The compact size of the device and its ease of use made it possible for the electronic diaries to be carried around and used in the patients' everyday life setting. This was an early example of <a href="electronic%20patient-reported%20outcome">electronic patient-reported outcome</a>s (<a href="ePRO">ePRO</a>)

A. E. van Vogt

Alfred Elton van Vogt (; April 26, 1912 – January 26, 2000) was a Canadian-born <a href="science%20fiction%20author">science fiction author</a>. He is regarded as one of the most popular, influential and complex practitioners of the mid-twentieth century, the genre's so-called <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Golden Age</a>.

Van Vogt was born on a farm in Edenburg (a <a href="Russian%20Mennonite">Russian Mennonite</a> community east of <a href="Gretna%2C%20Manitoba">Gretna, Manitoba</a>, Canada). Until age four, van Vogt and his family spoke only a <a href="Plautdietsch">dialect of Low German</a> at home. Van Vogt's father, a lawyer, moved his family several times. His son found these moves difficult, remarking in later life:

After starting his writing career by writing for <a href="True%20Confessions%20%28magazine%29">true-confession</a> style <a href="pulp%20magazines">pulp magazines</a> such as "<a href="True%20Story%20%28magazine%29">True Story</a>", van Vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed, science fiction. He was inspired by the August 1938 issue of "<a href="Astounding%20Science%20Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a>," which he picked up at a newsstand. The story "<a href="Who%20Goes%20There%3F">Who Goes There?</a>" led him to write "<a href="Vault%20of%20the%20Beast">Vault of the Beast</a>", which he submitted to that same magazine. It was rejected, but the rejection letter encouraged him to try again. He sent in a story called "<a href="Black%20Destroyer">Black Destroyer</a>," which was accepted. A rewritten version of "Vault of the Beast" would be published in 1940.

Van Vogt's first SF publication was inspired by "<a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">The Voyage of the Beagle</a>" by <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>. "The Black Destroyer" was published in July 1939 by <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a> in "<a href="Astounding%20Science%20Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a>", the centennial year of Darwin's journal. It featured a fierce, carnivorous <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">alien</a>, the <a href="coeurl">coeurl</a>, stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship. "Discord in Scarlet" was his second story to be published, also appearing as the cover story. It was accompanied by interior illustrations created by <a href="Frank%20Kramer%20%28artist%29">Frank Kramer</a> and Paul Orban. (Van Vogt and Kramer thus debuted in the issue of "Astounding" that is sometimes singled out for ushering in the "Golden Age" of science fiction.) The former story served as the inspiration for multiple science fiction movies. In 1950, the two were combined with two other stories as a <a href="fix-up">fix-up</a> novel, "<a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Space%20Beagle">The Voyage of the Space Beagle</a>" (Simon & Schuster), which was published in at least five European languages by 1955. Positing the need for exobiologists who will appreciate the differences between the inhabitants of other planets and ourselves, it stresses the importance of the civilian rather than military in exploration of other cultures.

Van Vogt's first completed novel, and one of his most famous, is "<a href="Slan">Slan</a>" (Arkham House, 1946), which Campbell serialized in "Astounding" September to December 1940. Using what became one of van Vogt's recurring themes, it told the story of a 9-year-old superman living in a world in which his kind are slain by "<a href="Homo%20sapiens">Homo sapiens</a>".

In 1941, van Vogt decided to become a full-time writer, quitting his job at the <a href="Department%20of%20National%20Defence%20%28Canada%29">Canadian Department of National Defence</a>. Prolific for a few years, van Vogt wrote many short stories. In the 1950s, many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels, or "fixups" as he called them, a term that entered the vocabulary of science-fiction criticism. When the original stories were related (e.g., "The War against the Rull") this was often successful. When not (e.g., "<a href="Quest%20for%20the%20Future">Quest for the Future</a>") the disparate stories thrown together generally made for a less coherent plot.

In 1944, van Vogt moved to <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, where his writing took on new dimensions after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He was always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern <a href="meta-systems">meta-systems</a>)—the characters in his very first story used a system called "Nexialism" to analyze the alien's behavior, and he became interested in the <a href="general%20semantics">general semantics</a> of <a href="Alfred%20Korzybski">Alfred Korzybski</a>.

He subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes, "<a href="The%20World%20of%20Null-A">The World of Null-A</a>" and "<a href="The%20Pawns%20of%20Null-A">The Pawns of Null-A</a>" in the late 1940s, and "<a href="Null-A%20Three">Null-A Three</a>" in the early 1980s. "Null-A", or <a href="non-Aristotelian%20logic">non-Aristotelian logic</a>, refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using <a href="Intuition%20%28knowledge%29">intuitive</a>, <a href="inductive%20reasoning">inductive reasoning</a> (compare <a href="fuzzy%20logic">fuzzy logic</a>), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, <a href="deductive%20reasoning">deductive reasoning</a>.

Van Vogt was profoundly affected by revelations of <a href="totalitarian">totalitarian</a> <a href="police%20state">police state</a>s that emerged after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He wrote a mainstream novel that he set in Communist China, "The Violent Man" (1962); he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about China. Into this book he incorporated his view of "the violent male type", which he described as a "man who had to be right", a man who "instantly attracts women" and who he said were the men who "run the world".

At the same time, in his fiction, van Vogt was consistently sympathetic to absolute monarchy as a form of government. This was the case, for instance, in the "<a href="The%20Weapon%20Shops%20of%20Isher">Weapon Shop</a>" series, the "<a href="The%20Mixed%20Men">Mixed Men</a>" series, and in single stories such as "Heir Apparent" (1945), whose protagonist was described as a "benevolent dictator".

Van Vogt systematized his writing method, using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved. Several of his stories hinge on temporal <a href="Riddle">conundra</a>, a favorite theme. He stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from three books: "Narrative Technique" by Thomas Uzzell, "The Only Two Ways to Write a Story" by <a href="John%20Gallishaw">John Gallishaw</a>, and "Twenty Problems of the Fiction Writer" by Gallishaw.

He also claimed many of his ideas came from dreams; throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90 minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams.

Van Vogt published perhaps his most famous story, "Enchanted Village", in the July 1950 issue of "Other Worlds Science Stories". It was reprinted in over 20 collections or anthologies, and appeared many times in translation.

In 1950, van Vogt was briefly appointed as head of <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>'s Dianetics operation in California. <a href="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> was the secular precursor to Hubbard's Church of <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a>. The operation went broke nine months later, but never went bankrupt, due to van Vogt's arrangements with creditors. Van Vogt and his wife opened their own Dianetics centre, partly financed by his writings, until he "signed off" around 1961. At the time of his interview with Charles Platt, van Vogt was still president of the Californian Association of Dianetic Auditors.

In 1951, he published "<a href="The%20Weapon%20Shops%20of%20Isher">The Weapon Shops of Isher</a>." In the same decade, van Vogt also produced collections and <a href="fixup">fixup</a>s such as "<a href="The%20Mixed%20Men">The Mixed Men</a>" (1952), "<a href="The%20War%20Against%20the%20Rull">The War Against the Rull</a>" (1959), and the two "Clane" novels, "<a href="Empire%20of%20the%20Atom">Empire of the Atom</a>" (1957) and "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Linn">The Wizard of Linn</a>" (1962), which were inspired (like <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Asimov</a>'s <a href="Foundation%20series">Foundation series</a>) by <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman imperial history</a>, specifically the reign of <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a>. His later novels included fixups such as "The Beast" (also known as "Moonbeast") (1963), "<a href="Rogue%20Ship">Rogue Ship</a>" (1965), "<a href="Quest%20for%20the%20Future">Quest for the Future</a>" (1970) and "<a href="Supermind%20%28novel%29">Supermind</a>" (1977); expanded short stories ("The Darkness on Diamondia" (1972), "Future Glitter" (also known as "Tyranopolis"; 1973); original novels such as "<a href="Children%20of%20Tomorrow">Children of Tomorrow</a>" (1970), "The Battle of Forever" (1971) and "The Anarchistic Colossus" (1977); plus sequels to his classic works, many of which were promised, but only one of which appeared, "<a href="Null-A%20Three">Null-A Three</a>" (1984; originally published in French). Several later books were original in Europe, and at least one novel only ever appeared in Italian.

On January 26, 2000, van Vogt died in Los Angeles, United States from <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, survived by his second wife, the former Lydia Bereginsky.

Critical opinion about the quality of van Vogt's work is sharply divided.

One early and articulate critic was <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a>. In a 1945 chapter-long essay reprinted in "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Wonder">In Search of Wonder</a>," entitled "Cosmic Jerrybuilder: A. E. van Vogt", Knight famously remarked that van Vogt "is no giant; he is a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter". Knight described "The World of Null-A" as "one of the worst allegedly adult science fiction stories ever published". About van Vogt's writing, Knight said:

About "<a href="Empire%20of%20the%20Atom">Empire of the Atom</a>" Knight wrote:
Knight also expressed misgivings about van Vogt's politics, noting that his stories almost invariably present <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarchy</a> in a favorable light. But in 1974, he went partly back on his criticism after finding out about Vogt's working methods about writing down his dreams:
On the other hand, when science fiction author <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a> was asked which science fiction writers had influenced his work the most, he replied:

Dick also defended van Vogt against Damon Knight’s criticisms:

In a review of "Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt", science fiction writer <a href="Paul%20Di%20Filippo">Paul Di Filippo</a> said:
In "The <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a> Letters", Campbell says, "The son-of-a-gun gets hold of you in the first paragraph, ties a knot around you, and keeps it tied in every paragraph thereafter—including the ultimate last one".

<a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a> (who began reading van Vogt as a teenager) wrote, "Van was the first writer to shine light on the restricted ways in which I had been taught to view the universe and the human condition".

Writing in 1984 David Hartwell said:

The literary critic <a href="Leslie%20A.%20Fiedler">Leslie A. Fiedler</a> said something similar:

The American literary critic <a href="Fredric%20Jameson">Fredric Jameson</a> says of van Vogt:

Nevertheless, van Vogt still has his critics. For example, <a href="Darrell%20Schweitzer">Darrell Schweitzer</a> writing to "The New York Review of Science Fiction" in 1999 quoted a passage from the original van Vogt novelette "The Mixed Men", which he was then reading, and remarked:

In 1946, van Vogt and his first wife, <a href="Edna%20Mayne%20Hull">Edna Mayne Hull</a>, were Guests of Honor at the fourth <a href="World%20Science%20Fiction%20Convention">World Science Fiction Convention</a>.

In 1980, van Vogt received a "Casper Award" (precursor to the Canadian <a href="Prix%20Aurora%20Awards">Prix Aurora Awards</a>) for Lifetime Achievement.

The <a href="Science%20Fiction%20Writers%20of%20America">Science Fiction Writers of America</a> named him its 14th <a href="SFWA%20Grand%20Master">Grand Master</a> in 1995 (presented 1996). Great controversy within SFWA accompanied its long wait in bestowing its highest honor (limited to living writers, no more than one annually). Writing an obituary of van Vogt, Robert J. Sawyer, a fellow Canadian writer of science fiction remarked:

It is generally held that the "damnable SFWA politics" concerns Damon Knight, the founder of the SFWA, who abhorred van Vogt's style and politics and thoroughly demolished his literary reputation in the 1950s.

Harlan Ellison was more explicit in 1999 introduction to "Futures Past: The Best Short Fiction of A. E. van Vogt":

In 1996, van Vogt received a Special Award from the <a href="World%20Science%20Fiction%20Convention">World Science Fiction Convention</a> "for six decades of golden age science fiction". That same year, the <a href="EMP%20Museum%23Science%20Fiction%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame</a> inducted him in its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons, along with writer <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a> (also living) and editors <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> and <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>.

The works of van Vogt were translated into French by the surrealist <a href="Boris%20Vian">Boris Vian</a> ("The World of Null-A" as "Le Monde des Å" in 1958), and van Vogt's works were "viewed as great literature of the surrealist school". In addition, "Slan" was published in French, translated by Jean Rosenthal, under the title "À la poursuite des Slans", as part of the paperback series 'Editions J'ai Lu: Romans-Texte Integral' in 1973, this edition also listing the following works by van Vogt as having been published in French as part of this series: "Le Monde des Å", "La faune de l'espace", "Les joueurs du Å", "L'empire de l'atome", "Le sorcier de Linn", "Les armureries d'Isher", "Les fabricants d'armes", and "Le livre de Ptath".

Anna Kournikova

Anna Sergeyevna Kournikova (; born 7 June 1981) is a Russian former professional <a href="tennis">tennis</a> player. Her appearance and celebrity status made her one of the best known tennis stars worldwide. At the peak of her fame, fans looking for images of Kournikova made her name one of the most common search strings on <a href="Google%20Search">Google Search</a>.

Despite never winning a singles title, she reached No. 8 in the world in 2000. She achieved greater success playing doubles, where she was at times the <a href="List%20of%20WTA%20number%201%20ranked%20players">World No. 1</a> player. With <a href="Martina%20Hingis">Martina Hingis</a> as her partner, she won <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29">Grand Slam titles</a> in <a href="Australian%20Open">Australia</a> in <a href="1999%20Australian%20Open">1999</a> and <a href="2002%20Australian%20Open">2002</a>, and the <a href="WTA%20Championships">WTA Championships</a> in <a href="1999%20WTA%20Tour%20Championships">1999</a> and <a href="2000%20WTA%20Tour%20Championships">2000</a>. They referred to themselves as the "<a href="Spice%20Girls">Spice Girls</a> of Tennis".

Kournikova's professional tennis career ended prematurely at the age of 21 due to serious back and spinal problems, including a <a href="Spinal%20disc%20herniation">herniated disk</a>. She lives in <a href="Miami%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Miami Beach</a>, Florida, and plays in occasional exhibitions and in doubles for the <a href="St.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLouis%20Aces">St. Louis Aces</a> of <a href="World%20TeamTennis">World Team Tennis</a>. She was a new trainer for season 12 of the television show "<a href="The%20Biggest%20Loser">The Biggest Loser</a>", replacing <a href="Jillian%20Michaels%20%28personal%20trainer%29">Jillian Michaels</a>, but did not return for season 13. In addition to her tennis and television work, Kournikova serves as a Global Ambassador for <a href="Population%20Services%20International">Population Services International</a>'s "<a href="Five%20%26amp%3B%20Alive">Five & Alive</a>" program, which addresses health crises facing children under the age of five and their families.

Anna Kournikova was born in Moscow, Russia, on 7 June 1981. Her father, Sergei Kournikov (born 1961), a former <a href="Greco-Roman%20wrestling">Greco-Roman wrestling</a> champion, eventually earned a PhD and was a professor at the University of Physical Culture and Sport in Moscow. As of 2001, he was still a part-time martial arts instructor there. Her mother Alla (born 1963) had been a <a href="400%20metres">400-metre runner</a>. Her younger brother, <a href="Allan%20Kournikova">Allan</a>, is a youth golf world champion who was featured in the 2013 documentary film "<a href="The%20Short%20Game">The Short Game</a>".

Sergei Kournikov has said, "We were young and we liked the clean, physical life, so Anna was in a good environment for sport from the beginning".

Kournikova received her first tennis <a href="racquet">racquet</a> as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, "I played two times a week from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I was going to play professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd spend the rest of the day there just having fun with the kids." In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the <a href="Spartak%20Tennis%20Club">Spartak Tennis Club</a>, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to <a href="Bradenton%2C%20Florida">Bradenton</a>, Florida, to train at <a href="Nick%20Bollettieri">Nick Bollettieri</a>'s celebrated tennis academy.

Following her arrival in the United States, Kournikova became prominent on the tennis scene. At 14, she won the European Championships and the <a href="Rome%20Masters">Italian Open</a> Junior tournament. She became the youngest player to win the 18-and-under division of the Junior <a href="Dunlop%20Orange%20Bowl">Orange Bowl</a> tennis tournament. By the end of the year, Kournikova was crowned the <a href="International%20Tennis%20Federation">ITF</a> <a href="International%20Tennis%20Federation">Junior World Champion U-18</a> and Junior European Champion U-18.

She also won six doubles titles – Gold Coast (with Julie Halard), Hamburg (with Natasha Zvereva), Filderstadt, Zürich, Philadelphia and the 2000 WTA Tour Championships (with Martina Hingis).

Her 2001 season was dominated by injury, including a left foot stress fracture which forced her withdrawal from twelve tournaments, including the <a href="2001%20French%20Open">French Open</a> and <a href="2001%20Wimbledon%20Championships">Wimbledon</a>.

Kournikova's two <a href="Grand%20Slam%20in%20tennis">Grand Slam</a> doubles titles came in 1999 and 2002, both at the Australian Open in the Women's Doubles event with partner <a href="Martina%20Hingis">Martina Hingis</a>. Kournikova proved a successful doubles player on the professional circuit, winning 16 tournament doubles titles, including two Australian Opens and being a finalist in mixed doubles at the <a href="US%20Open%20%28tennis%29">US Open</a> and at Wimbledon, and reaching the No. 1 ranking in doubles in the <a href="Women%27s%20Tennis%20Association">Women's Tennis Association</a> tour rankings. Her pro career doubles record was 200–71. However, her singles career plateaued after 1999. For the most part, she managed to retain her ranking between 10 and 15 (her career high singles ranking was No.8), but her expected finals breakthrough failed to occur; she only reached four finals out of 130 singles tournaments, never in a Grand Slam event, and never won one.

Her singles record is 209–129. Her final playing years were marred by a string of injuries, especially back injuries, which caused her ranking to erode gradually. As a personality Kournikova was among the most common search strings for both articles and images in her prime.

Kournikova has not played on the <a href="WTA%20Tour">WTA Tour</a> since 2003, but still plays exhibition matches for charitable causes. In late 2004, she participated in three events organized by <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> and by fellow tennis players <a href="Serena%20Williams">Serena Williams</a> and <a href="Andy%20Roddick">Andy Roddick</a>.

In November 2005, she teamed up with <a href="Martina%20Hingis">Martina Hingis</a>, playing against <a href="Lisa%20Raymond">Lisa Raymond</a> and <a href="Samantha%20Stosur">Samantha Stosur</a> in the WTT finals for charity. Kournikova is also a member of the St. Louis Aces in the <a href="World%20Team%20Tennis">World Team Tennis</a> (WTT), playing doubles only.

In September 2008, Kournikova showed up for the 2008 Nautica Malibu Triathlon held at <a href="Zuma%20Beach">Zuma Beach</a> in <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu, California</a>. The Race raised funds for children's Hospital Los Angeles. She won that race for women's <a href="K-Swiss">K-Swiss</a> team. On 27 September 2008, Kournikova played exhibition mixed doubles matches in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, partnering with <a href="Tim%20Wilkison">Tim Wilkison</a> and <a href="Karel%20Nov%C3%A1%C4%8Dek">Karel Nováček</a>. Kournikova and Wilkison defeated <a href="Jimmy%20Arias">Jimmy Arias</a> and <a href="Chanda%20Rubin">Chanda Rubin</a>, and then Kournikova and Novacek defeated Rubin and Wilkison.

On 12 October 2008, Anna Kournikova played one exhibition match for the annual charity event, hosted by <a href="Billie%20Jean%20King">Billie Jean King</a> and <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, and raised more than $400,000 for the Elton John AIDS Foundation and Atlanta AIDS Partnership Fund. She played doubles with <a href="Andy%20Roddick">Andy Roddick</a> (they were coached by David Chang) versus <a href="Martina%20Navratilova">Martina Navratilova</a> and <a href="Jesse%20Levine">Jesse Levine</a> (coached by Billie Jean King); Kournikova and Roddick won.

Kournikova competed alongside <a href="John%20McEnroe">John McEnroe</a>, <a href="Tracy%20Austin">Tracy Austin</a> and <a href="Jim%20Courier">Jim Courier</a> at the "Legendary Night", which was held on 2 May 2009, at the Turning Stone Event Center in <a href="Verona%2C%20New%20York">Verona, New York</a>. The exhibition included a mixed doubles match of McEnroe and Austin against Courier and Kournikova.

In 2008, she was named a spokesperson for K-Swiss. In 2005, Kournikova stated that if she were 100% fit, she would like to come back and compete again.

In June 2010, Kournikova reunited with her doubles partner <a href="Martina%20Hingis">Martina Hingis</a> to participate in competitive tennis for the first time in seven years in the Invitational Ladies Doubles event at Wimbledon. On 29 June 2010 they defeated the British pair <a href="Samantha%20Smith%20%28tennis%29">Samantha Smith</a> and <a href="Anne%20Hobbs">Anne Hobbs</a>.

Kournikova plays right-handed with a two-handed <a href="backhand">backhand</a>. She is a great player at the net. She can hit forceful groundstrokes and also <a href="drop%20shot">drop shot</a>s.

Her playing style fits the profile for a doubles player, and is complemented by her height. She has been compared to such doubles specialists as <a href="Pam%20Shriver">Pam Shriver</a> and <a href="Peter%20Fleming%20%28tennis%20player%29">Peter Fleming</a>.

Kournikova was in a relationship with fellow Russian <a href="Pavel%20Bure">Pavel Bure</a>, an <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">NHL</a> <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> player. The two met in 1999 when Kournikova was still linked to Bure's former Russian teammate <a href="Sergei%20Fedorov">Sergei Fedorov</a>. Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after a reporter took a photo of them together in a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him. As the story made headlines in Russia, where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities, Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement. Kournikova, 10 years younger than Bure, was 18 years old at the time.

The following year, Kournikova and Fedorov were married in Moscow. Fedorov claimed he and Kournikova were married in 2001, and divorced in 2003. Kournikova's representatives deny any marriage to Fedorov; however, Fedorov's agent Pat Brisson claims that although he does not know when they got married, he knew "Fedorov was married".

Kournikova started dating pop star <a href="Enrique%20Iglesias">Enrique Iglesias</a> in late 2001 (she appeared in his video, "Escape"). Kournikova has consistently refused to directly confirm or deny the status of her personal relationships. In June 2008, Iglesias was quoted by the "<a href="Daily%20Star%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Daily Star</a>" as having married Kournikova the previous year and subsequently separated. The couple have invested in a $20 million home to be built on a private island in Miami.

Most of Kournikova's fame has come from the publicity surrounding her looks and her personal life. During her debut at the 1996 US Open at the age of 15, the western world noticed her beauty, and soon pictures of her appeared in numerous magazines worldwide.

In 2000, Kournikova became the new face for <a href="Berlei">Berlei</a>'s shock absorber <a href="sports%20bra">sports bra</a>s, and appeared in the "only the ball should bounce" billboard campaign. Following that, she was cast by the <a href="Farrelly%20brothers">Farrelly brothers</a> for a minor role in the 2000 film "<a href="Me%2C%20Myself%20%26amp%3B%20Irene">Me, Myself & Irene</a>" starring <a href="Jim%20Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> and <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Zellweger">Renée Zellweger</a>. Photographs of her have appeared on covers of various publications, including <a href="List%20of%20men%27s%20magazines">men's magazines</a>, such as one in the much-publicized 2004 "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated%20Swimsuit%20Issue">Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue</a>", where she posed in bikinis and swimsuits, as well as in "<a href="FHM">FHM</a>" and "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>". Kournikova was named one of "<a href="People%20%28American%20magazine%29">People</a>'s" 50 Most Beautiful People in 1998 and was voted "hottest female athlete" on <a href="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a>. In 2002 she also placed first in "<a href="FHM">FHM</a>'s <a href="FHM%27s%20100%20Sexiest%20Women%20%28UK%29">100 Sexiest Women in the World</a>" in US and UK editions. By contrast, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>—citing the degree of hype as compared to actual accomplishments as a singles player—ranked Kournikova 18th in its "25 Biggest Sports Flops of the Past 25 Years". Kournikova was also ranked No. 1 in the ESPN Classic series "Who's number 1?" when the series featured sport's most overrated athletes.

She continued to be the most searched athlete on the Internet through 2008 even though she had retired from the professional tennis circuit years earlier. After slipping from first to sixth among athletes in 2009, she moved back up to third place among athletes in terms of search popularity in 2010.

In October 2010, Kournikova headed to NBC's "<a href="The%20Biggest%20Loser">The Biggest Loser</a>" where she led the contestants in a tennis-workout challenge. In May 2011, it was announced that Kournikova would join "<a href="The%20Biggest%20Loser">The Biggest Loser</a>" as a regular celebrity trainer in season 12. She did not return for season 13.

In November 2010, she became an American citizen. In 2011, "<a href="Men%27s%20Health%20%28magazine%29">Men's Health</a>" named her one of the "100 Hottest Women of All-Time", ranking her at No. 29.

Agnosticism

Agnosticism is the view that the <a href="existence%20of%20God">existence of God</a> or the <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> is unknown or <a href="Uncertainty">unknowable</a>.

According to the philosopher <a href="William%20L.%20Rowe">William L. Rowe</a>, "agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist". Agnosticism is a <a href="doctrine">doctrine</a> or set of <a href="wikt%3Atenet">tenet</a>s rather than a <a href="religion">religion</a>.

English biologist <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a> coined the word "agnostic" in 1869.
Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as <a href="Sanjaya%20Belatthaputta">Sanjaya Belatthaputta</a>, a <a href="Ancient%20Indian%20philosophy">5th-century BCE Indian philosopher</a> who expressed agnosticism about any <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a>; and <a href="Protagoras">Protagoras</a>, a <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">5th-century BCE Greek philosopher</a> who expressed agnosticism about the existence of "the gods". The <a href="Nasadiya%20Sukta">Nasadiya Sukta</a> in the <a href="Rigveda">Rigveda</a> is agnostic about the <a href="origin%20of%20the%20universe">origin of the universe</a>.

Being a scientist, above all else, <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Huxley</a> presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. <a href="Karl%20Popper">Karl Popper</a> would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher <a href="William%20L.%20Rowe">William L. Rowe</a>, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.

Others have redefined this concept. <a href="George%20H.%20Smith">George H. Smith</a>, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as <a href="agnostic%20atheism">agnostic atheism</a> (the view of those who do not "believe" in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to "know" if a deity does or does not exist) and <a href="agnostic%20theism">agnostic theism</a> (the view of those who do not claim to "know" of the existence of any deity, but still "believe" in such an existence).

"Agnostic" () was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy, which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.

Early <a href="Christian">Christian</a> church leaders used the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word "<a href="gnosis">gnosis</a>" (knowledge) to describe "spiritual knowledge". Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of <a href="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.
Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of <a href="Skepticism">skeptical</a>, evidence-based inquiry.

In recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean "not knowable".
In technical and marketing literature, "agnostic" can also mean independence from some parameters—for example, "platform agnostic"
or "hardware agnostic".

<a href="Scottish%20Enlightenment">Scottish Enlightenment</a> philosopher <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a> contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt. He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (e.g. <a href="tautology%20%28logic%29">tautologies</a> such as "all bachelors are unmarried" or "all triangles have three corners").


Agnostic thought, in the form of <a href="Philosophical%20skepticism">skepticism</a>, emerged as a formal philosophical position in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>. Its proponents included <a href="Protagoras">Protagoras</a>, <a href="Pyrrho">Pyrrho</a>, <a href="Carneades">Carneades</a>, <a href="Sextus%20Empiricus">Sextus Empiricus</a>
and, to some degree, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, who was a strong advocate for a skeptical approach to <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>.

<a href="Pyrrho">Pyrrho</a> said that we should refrain from making judgment as we can never know the true reality. According to Pyrrho, having opinion was possible, but certainty and knowledge are impossible.
<a href="Carneades">Carneades</a> was also a skeptic in relation to all knowledge claims. He proposed a probability theory, however. According to him, certainty could never be attained. <a href="Protagoras">Protagoras</a> rejected the conventional accounts of the gods. He said:

Throughout the history of <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> there has been a strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism.

The <a href="Rig%20Veda">Rig Veda</a> takes an agnostic view on the fundamental question of how the universe and the gods were created. <a href="Nasadiya%20Sukta">Nasadiya Sukta</a> ("Creation Hymn") in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda says:
<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>,
<a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>,
<a href="Aquinas">Aquinas</a>,
and <a href="Descartes">Descartes</a>
presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of God. The skeptical empiricism of <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, the <a href="antinomy">antinomies</a> of <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, and the existential philosophy of <a href="S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a> convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts, regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of God.

In his 1844 book, "<a href="Philosophical%20Fragments">Philosophical Fragments</a>", Kierkegaard writes:
<a href="David%20Hume">Hume</a> was Huxley's favourite philosopher, calling him "the Prince of Agnostics". <a href="Denis%20Diderot">Diderot</a> wrote to his mistress, telling of a visit by Hume to the <a href="Baron%20D%27Holbach">Baron D'Holbach</a>, and describing how a word for the position that Huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn't seem to exist, or at least wasn't common knowledge, at the time.

Agnostic views are as old as <a href="philosophical%20skepticism">philosophical skepticism</a>, but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Huxley</a> to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the "unconditioned" (<a href="Sir%20William%20Hamilton%2C%209th%20Baronet">William Hamilton</a>) and the "unknowable" (<a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>). Though Huxley began to use the term "agnostic" in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>, Huxley discussed his views extensively:
And again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:
Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:
In 1889, Huxley wrote:Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.

<a href="William%20Stewart%20Ross">William Stewart Ross</a> wrote under the name of Saladin. He championed agnosticism in opposition to the <a href="atheism">atheism</a> of <a href="Charles%20Bradlaugh">Charles Bradlaugh</a> as an open-ended spiritual exploration.
In "Why I am an Agnostic" (c. 1889) he claims that agnosticism is "the very reverse of atheism".

<a href="Robert%20G.%20Ingersoll">Robert G. Ingersoll</a>, an <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> lawyer and politician who evolved into a well-known and sought-after orator in 19th-century America, has been referred to as the "Great Agnostic".

In an 1896 lecture titled "Why I Am An Agnostic", Ingersoll related why he was an agnostic:
In the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as:

<a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>'s <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>, "<a href="Why%20I%20Am%20Not%20a%20Christian">Why I Am Not a Christian</a>", based on a speech delivered in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title, is considered a classic statement of agnosticism.
He calls upon his readers to "stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence".

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on "The existence and nature of God", in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:
However, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:
In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, "Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic?" (subtitled "A Plea For Tolerance in the Face of New Dogmas"), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:
In his 1953 essay, "What Is An Agnostic?" Russell states:
Later in the essay, Russell adds:
In 1965 Christian theologian <a href="Leslie%20Weatherhead">Leslie Weatherhead</a> published "The Christian Agnostic", in which he argues:
Although radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians, Weatherhead's "agnosticism" falls far short of Huxley's, and short even of "weak agnosticism":
Raised in a religious environment, <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> studied to be an Anglican clergyman. While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance. Darwin stated that it would be "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist". Although reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that "I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. – I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind."

<a href="Demographic">Demographic</a> research services normally do not differentiate between various types of non-religious respondents, so agnostics are often classified in the same category as <a href="atheism">atheists</a> or other <a href="irreligion">non-religious</a> people.

A 2010 survey published in "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>" found that the non-religious people or the agnostics made up about 9.6% of the world's population.
A November–December 2006 poll published in the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" gives rates for the United States and five European countries. The rates of agnosticism in the United States were at 14%, while the rates of agnosticism in the European countries surveyed were considerably higher: Italy (20%), Spain (30%), Great Britain (35%), Germany (25%), and France (32%).

A study conducted by the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a> found that about 16% of the world's people, the third largest group after <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, have no religious affiliation.
According to a 2012 report by the Pew Research Center, agnostics made up 3.3% of the US adult population.
In the "U.S. Religious Landscape Survey", conducted by the Pew Research Center, 55% of agnostic respondents expressed "a belief in God or a universal spirit",
whereas 41% stated that they thought that they felt a tension "being non-religious in a society where most people are religious".
According to the 2011 <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>, 22% of <a href="Australians">Australians</a> have "no religion", a category that includes agnostics.
Between 64% and 65%
of <a href="Japanese%20people">Japanese</a> and up to 81%
of <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a> are atheists, agnostics, or do not believe in a god. An official <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> survey reported that 3% of the EU population is unsure about their belief in a god or spirit.

Agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to <a href="materialism">materialism</a>. Some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.

Theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist ("etsi deus non-daretur"), or as if God did exist ("etsi deus daretur").

Religious scholars such as Laurence B. Brown criticize the misuse of the word agnosticism, claiming that it has become one of the most misapplied terms in metaphysics. Brown raises the question, "You claim that nothing can be known with certainty ... how, then, can you be so sure?"

According to <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific <a href="truth">truth</a>. He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.
"Agnosticism", said Ratzinger, "is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man ... The knowledge of God has always existed". He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>, a readiness to be purified by the truth.

The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> sees merit in examining what it calls "partial agnosticism", specifically those systems that "do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge". However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The <a href="Council%20of%20the%20Vatican">Council of the Vatican</a> declares, "God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation".

<a href="Blaise%20Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as <a href="Pascal%27s%20Wager">Pascal's Wager</a>: the <a href="Infinity">infinite</a> expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer "bet" to choose God.

<a href="Peter%20Kreeft">Peter Kreeft</a> and Ronald Tacelli cited 20 arguments for God's existence, asserting that any demand for evidence testable in a laboratory is in effect asking God, the supreme being, to become man's servant.

According to <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, "I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden." Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; "Temporary Agnostics in Practice" (TAPs), and "Permanent Agnostics in Principle" (PAPs). He states that "agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability.", and considers PAP a "deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting".

<a href="Ignosticism">Ignosticism</a> is the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the <a href="theological%20noncognitivism">noncognitivist</a> view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.

<a href="Alfred%20Ayer">A.J. Ayer</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Drange">Theodore Drange</a>, and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept "a deity exists" as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.

Argon

Argon is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Ar and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 18. It is in group 18 of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> and is a <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, at 0.934% (9340 <a href="Argon%23Occurrence">ppmv</a>). It is more than twice as abundant as <a href="water%20vapor">water vapor</a> (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as <a href="neon">neon</a> (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.

Nearly all of the argon in Earth's atmosphere is <a href="radiogenic">radiogenic</a> <a href="argon-40">argon-40</a>, derived from the <a href="Radioactive%20decay">decay</a> of <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a> in the Earth's crust. In the universe, <a href="argon-36">argon-36</a> is by far the most common argon <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, being the preferred argon isotope produced by stellar <a href="nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a> in <a href="supernova">supernova</a>s.

The name "argon" is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word , neuter singular form of meaning "lazy" or "inactive", as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. The complete <a href="octet%20rule">octet</a> (eight electrons) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its <a href="triple%20point">triple point</a> temperature of 83.8058 <a href="Kelvin">K</a> is a defining fixed point in the <a href="International%20Temperature%20Scale%20of%201990">International Temperature Scale of 1990</a>.

Argon is produced industrially by the <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> of <a href="liquid%20air">liquid air</a>. Argon is mostly used as an <a href="Inert%20gas">inert</a> <a href="shielding%20gas">shielding gas</a> in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in <a href="graphite">graphite</a> electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in <a href="Incandescent%20light%20bulb">incandescent</a>, <a href="fluorescent%20lighting">fluorescent lighting</a>, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive <a href="Ion%20laser%23Argon%20laser">blue-green gas laser</a>. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.

Argon has approximately the same <a href="solubility">solubility</a> in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas. Argon is chemically <a href="Inert%20gas">inert</a> under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.

Although argon is a <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>, it can form some compounds under extreme conditions. <a href="Argon%20fluorohydride">Argon fluorohydride</a> (HArF), a compound of argon with <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> that is stable below , has been demonstrated. Although the neutral ground-state chemical compounds of argon are presently limited to HArF, argon can form <a href="clathrates">clathrates</a> with <a href="water%20%28molecule%29">water</a> when atoms of argon are trapped in a lattice of water molecules. <a href="Ions">Ions</a>, such as , and <a href="exciplex">excited-state complexes</a>, such as ArF, have been demonstrated. Theoretical calculation predicts several more argon compounds that should be stable but have not yet been synthesized.

"Argon" (, neuter singular form of , meaning "inactive", in reference to its chemical inactivity) was suspected to be a component of air by <a href="Henry%20Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a> in 1785. Argon was first isolated from air in 1894 by <a href="John%20William%20Strutt%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a> and Sir <a href="William%20Ramsay">William Ramsay</a> at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> by removing <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, water, and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> from a sample of clean air. They had determined that nitrogen produced from chemical compounds was 0.5% lighter than nitrogen from the atmosphere. The difference was slight, but it was important enough to attract their attention for many months. They concluded that there was another gas in the air mixed in with the nitrogen. Argon was also encountered in 1882 through independent research of H. F. Newall and W. N. Hartley. Each observed new lines in the <a href="emission%20spectrum">emission spectrum</a> of air that did not match known elements. Argon was the first <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a> to be discovered. Until 1957, the symbol for argon was "A", but now is "Ar".

Argon constitutes 0.934% by volume and 1.288% by mass of the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products. Argon is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by <a href="cryogenics">cryogenic</a> <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a>, a process that also produces purified <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="neon">neon</a>, <a href="krypton">krypton</a> and <a href="xenon">xenon</a>. The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively.

The main <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s of argon found on Earth are (99.6%), (0.34%), and (0.06%). Naturally occurring , with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 1.25 years, decays to stable (11.2%) by <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> or <a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a>, and also to stable (88.8%) by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>. These properties and ratios are used to determine the age of <a href="Rock%20%28geology%29">rocks</a> by <a href="K%E2%80%93Ar%20dating">K–Ar dating</a>.

In the Earth's atmosphere, is made by <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a> activity, primarily by neutron capture of followed by two-neutron emission. In the subsurface environment, it is also produced through <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> by , followed by proton emission. is created from the <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> by followed by an <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a> emission as a result of subsurface <a href="nuclear%20testing">nuclear explosions</a>. It has a half-life of 35 days.

Between locations in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, the isotopic composition of argon varies greatly. Where the major source of argon is the decay of <a href="potassium-40"></a> in rocks, will be the dominant isotope, as it is on Earth. Argon produced directly by <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a>, is dominated by the <a href="alpha%20process">alpha-process</a> nuclide . Correspondingly, solar argon contains 84.6% (according to <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a> measurements), and the ratio of the three isotopes Ar : Ar : Ar in the atmospheres of the outer planets is 8400 : 1600 : 1. This contrasts with the low abundance of <a href="Primordial%20nuclide">primordial</a> in Earth's atmosphere, which is only 31.5 ppmv (= 9340 ppmv × 0.337%), comparable with that of neon (18.18 ppmv) on Earth and with interplanetary gasses, measured by <a href="interplanetary%20probe">probe</a>s.

The atmospheres of <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Mars">Mars</a>, <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> and <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a> (the largest moon of <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>) contain argon, predominantly as , and its content may be as high as 1.93% (Mars).

The predominance of <a href="radiogenic">radiogenic</a> is the reason the <a href="standard%20atomic%20weight">standard atomic weight</a> of terrestrial argon is greater than that of the next element, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, a fact that was puzzling when argon was discovered. <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Mendeleev</a> positioned the elements on his <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> in order of atomic weight, but the inertness of argon suggested a placement "before" the reactive <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a>. <a href="Henry%20Moseley">Henry Moseley</a> later solved this problem by showing that the periodic table is actually arranged in order of <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> (see <a href="History%20of%20the%20periodic%20table">History of the periodic table</a>).

Argon's complete octet of <a href="electrons">electrons</a> indicates full s and p subshells. This full <a href="valence%20shell">valence shell</a> makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements. Before 1962, argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds; however, compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized. The first argon compound with tungsten pentacarbonyl, W(CO)Ar, was isolated in 1975. However it was not widely recognised at that time. In August 2000, another argon compound, <a href="argon%20fluorohydride">argon fluorohydride</a> (HArF), was formed by researchers at the <a href="University%20of%20Helsinki">University of Helsinki</a>, by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of <a href="hydrogen%20fluoride">hydrogen fluoride</a> with <a href="caesium%20iodide">caesium iodide</a>. This discovery caused the recognition that argon could form weakly bound compounds, even though it was not the first. It is stable up to 17 <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a><a href="Kelvin%23Usage%20conventions">s</a> (−256 °C). The <a href="metastable">metastable</a> dication, which is valence-<a href="isoelectronicity">isoelectronic</a> with <a href="carbonyl%20fluoride">carbonyl fluoride</a> and <a href="phosgene">phosgene</a>, was observed in 2010. <a href="Argon-36">Argon-36</a>, in the form of argon hydride (<a href="argonium">argonium</a>) ions, has been detected in <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> associated with the <a href="Crab%20Nebula">Crab Nebula</a> <a href="supernova">supernova</a>; this was the first <a href="Noble%20gas">noble-gas molecule</a> detected in <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>.

Solid argon <a href="hydride">hydride</a> (Ar(H)) has the same crystal structure as the MgZn <a href="Laves%20phase">Laves phase</a>. It forms at pressures between 4.3 and 220 GPa, though Raman measurements suggest that the H molecules in Ar(H) dissociate above 175 GPa.

Argon is produced industrially by the <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> of <a href="liquid%20air">liquid air</a> in a <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> <a href="air%20separation">air separation</a> unit; a process that separates <a href="liquid%20nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a>, which boils at 77.3 K, from argon, which boils at 87.3 K, and <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a>, which boils at 90.2 K. About 700,000 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s of argon are produced worldwide every year.

<a href="Isotopes%20of%20argon">Ar</a>, the most abundant <a href="isotope">isotope</a> of argon, is produced by the decay of <a href="potassium">K</a> with a half-life of 1.25 years by <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> or <a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a>. Because of this, it is used in <a href="potassium%E2%80%93argon%20dating">potassium–argon dating</a> to determine the age of rocks.

Argon has several desirable properties:

Other <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es would be equally suitable for most of these applications, but argon is by far the cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> <a href="air%20separation">air separation</a> in the production of <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> and <a href="liquid%20nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a>: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except <a href="helium">helium</a>) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.

Argon is used in some high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.

For some of these processes, the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in some types of <a href="arc%20welding">arc welding</a> such as <a href="gas%20metal%20arc%20welding">gas metal arc welding</a> and <a href="gas%20tungsten%20arc%20welding">gas tungsten arc welding</a>, as well as in the processing of <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and other reactive elements. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of <a href="silicon">silicon</a> and <a href="germanium">germanium</a>.
Argon is used in the poultry industry to <a href="asphyxiant%20gas">asphyxiate</a> birds, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during <a href="inert%20gas%20asphyxiation">gassing</a>. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.

Argon is sometimes used for <a href="Gaseous%20fire%20suppression">extinguishing fires</a> where valuable equipment may be damaged by water or foam.

Liquid argon is used as the target for neutrino experiments and direct <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> searches. The interaction between the hypothetical <a href="Weakly%20interacting%20massive%20particles">WIMP</a>s and an argon nucleus produces <a href="scintillation%20%28physics%29">scintillation</a> light that is detected by <a href="photomultiplier%20tubes">photomultiplier tubes</a>. Two-phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP–nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield (about 51 photons/keV), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and is relatively easy to purify. Compared to <a href="xenon">xenon</a>, argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile, which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils. On the other hand, its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to contamination, unless one uses argon from underground sources, which has much less contamination. Most of the argon in the Earth’s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long-lived ( + e → + ν) present in natural potassium within the Earth. The activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction (n,2n) and similar reactions. The half-life of is only 269 years. As a result, the underground Ar, shielded by rock and water, has much less contamination. Dark-matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include <a href="DarkSide">DarkSide</a>, <a href="WIMP%20Argon%20Programme">WArP</a>, <a href="ArDM">ArDM</a>, <a href="Cryogenic%20Low-Energy%20Astrophysics%20with%20Neon">microCLEAN</a> and <a href="DEAP">DEAP</a>. Neutrino experiments include <a href="ICARUS%20%28experiment%29">ICARUS</a> and <a href="MicroBooNE">MicroBooNE</a>, both of which use high-purity liquid argon in a <a href="time%20projection%20chamber">time projection chamber</a> for fine grained three-dimensional imaging of neutrino interactions.

Argon is used to displace oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (argon has the <a href="E%20numbers">European food additive code</a> E938). Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. High-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and sealed in argon.

In <a href="winemaking">winemaking</a>, argon is used in a variety of activities to provide a barrier against oxygen at the liquid surface, which can spoil wine by fueling both microbial metabolism (as with <a href="acetic%20acid%20bacteria">acetic acid bacteria</a>) and standard <a href="redox">redox</a> chemistry.

Argon is sometimes used as the propellant in <a href="aerosol">aerosol</a> cans for such products as <a href="varnish">varnish</a>, <a href="polyurethane">polyurethane</a>, and paint, and to displace air when preparing a container for storage after opening.

Since 2002, the American <a href="National%20Archives">National Archives</a> stores important national documents such as the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a> within argon-filled cases to inhibit their degradation. Argon is preferable to the helium that had been used in the preceding five decades, because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced.

Argon may be used as the <a href="inert%20gas">inert gas</a> within <a href="Schlenk%20line">Schlenk line</a>s and <a href="glovebox">glovebox</a>es. Argon is preferred to less expensive nitrogen in cases where nitrogen may react with the reagents or apparatus.

Argon may be used as the carrier gas in <a href="gas%20chromatography">gas chromatography</a> and in <a href="electrospray%20ionization%20mass%20spectrometry">electrospray ionization mass spectrometry</a>; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in <a href="Inductively%20coupled%20plasma">ICP</a> <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a>. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for <a href="scanning%20electron%20microscopy">scanning electron microscopy</a>. Argon gas is also commonly used for <a href="sputter%20deposition">sputter deposition</a> of thin films as in <a href="microelectronics">microelectronics</a> and for <a href="microfabrication">wafer cleaning in microfabrication</a>.

<a href="Cryosurgery">Cryosurgery</a> procedures such as <a href="cryoablation">cryoablation</a> use liquid argon to destroy tissue such as <a href="cancer">cancer</a> cells. It is used in a procedure called "argon-enhanced coagulation", a form of argon <a href="plasma%20torch">plasma beam</a> <a href="electrosurgery">electrosurgery</a>. The procedure carries a risk of producing <a href="gas%20embolism">gas embolism</a> and has resulted in the death of at least one patient.

Blue <a href="argon%20laser">argon laser</a>s are used in surgery to weld arteries, destroy tumors, and correct eye defects.

Argon has also been used experimentally to replace nitrogen in the breathing or decompression mix known as <a href="Argox%20%28breathing%20gas%29">Argox</a>, to speed the elimination of dissolved nitrogen from the blood.

<a href="Incandescent%20light">Incandescent light</a>s are filled with argon, to preserve the <a href="electrical%20filament">filaments</a> at high temperature from oxidation. It is used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in <a href="plasma%20globe">plasma globe</a>s and <a href="Calorimeter%20%28particle%20physics%29">calorimetry</a> in experimental <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>. <a href="Gas-discharge%20lamp">Gas-discharge lamp</a>s filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green <a href="argon%20laser">argon-ion lasers</a>.

Argon is used for <a href="thermal%20insulation">thermal insulation</a> in <a href="Insulated%20glazing">energy-efficient windows</a>. Argon is also used in technical <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> to inflate a <a href="dry%20suit">dry suit</a> because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity.

Argon is used as a propellant in the development of the <a href="Variable%20Specific%20Impulse%20Magnetoplasma%20Rocket">Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket</a> (VASIMR). Compressed argon gas is allowed to expand, to cool the seeker heads of some versions of the <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a> missile and other missiles that use cooled thermal seeker heads. The gas is <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder%23Design">stored at high pressure</a>.

Argon-39, with a half-life of 269 years, has been used for a number of applications, primarily <a href="ice%20core">ice core</a> and <a href="ground%20water">ground water</a> dating. Also, <a href="potassium%E2%80%93argon%20dating">potassium–argon dating</a> is used to date <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a>s.

Argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent to simulate <a href="Hypoxia%20%28environmental%29">hypoxic</a> conditions. In 2014, the <a href="World%20Anti-Doping%20Agency">World Anti-Doping Agency</a> (WADA) added argon and <a href="xenon">xenon</a> to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although at this time there is no reliable test for abuse.

Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% <a href="density">denser</a> than air and therefore considered a dangerous <a href="asphyxiant%20gas">asphyxiant</a> in closed areas. It is difficult to detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a>ted after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.

Arsenic

Arsenic is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol As and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 33. Arsenic occurs in many <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s, usually in combination with <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="metal">metal</a>s, but also as a pure elemental <a href="crystal">crystal</a>. Arsenic is a <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a>. It has various <a href="allotropy">allotropes</a>, but only the gray form is important to industry.

The primary use of metallic arsenic is in alloys of <a href="lead">lead</a> (for example, in <a href="car%20batteries">car batteries</a> and <a href="ammunition">ammunition</a>). Arsenic is a common n-type <a href="dopant">dopant</a> in <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> electronic devices, and the <a href="optoelectronic">optoelectronic</a> compound <a href="gallium%20arsenide">gallium arsenide</a> is the second most commonly used semiconductor after doped <a href="silicon">silicon</a>. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, treated wood products, <a href="herbicide">herbicide</a>s, and <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s. These applications are declining, however.

<a href="%23Bacteria">A few species of bacteria</a> are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a>s. Trace quantities of arsenic are an essential <a href="dietary%20element">dietary element</a> in rats, hamsters, goats, chickens, and presumably many other species, including humans. However, <a href="arsenic%20poisoning">arsenic poisoning</a> occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed. <a href="Arsenic%20contamination%20of%20groundwater">Arsenic contamination of groundwater</a> is a problem that affects millions of people across the world.

The three most common arsenic <a href="Allotropy">allotropes</a> are metallic gray, yellow, and black arsenic, with gray being the most common. Gray arsenic (α-As, <a href="space%20group">space group</a> Rm No. 166) adopts a double-layered structure consisting of many interlocked, ruffled, six-membered rings. Because of weak bonding between the layers, gray arsenic is brittle and has a relatively low <a href="Mohs%20hardness">Mohs hardness</a> of 3.5. Nearest and next-nearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex, with the three atoms in the same double-layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 5.73 g/cm. Gray arsenic is a <a href="semimetal">semimetal</a>, but becomes a <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> with a <a href="bandgap">bandgap</a> of 1.2–1.4 eV if amorphized. Gray arsenic is also the most stable form. Yellow arsenic is soft and waxy, and somewhat similar to <a href="tetraphosphorus">tetraphosphorus</a> (). Both have four atoms arranged in a <a href="tetrahedral">tetrahedral</a> structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond. This unstable allotrope, being molecular, is the most volatile, least dense, and most toxic. Solid yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapor, . It is rapidly transformed into gray arsenic by light. The yellow form has a density of 1.97 g/cm. Black arsenic is similar in structure to <a href="black%20phosphorus">black phosphorus</a>.
Black arsenic can also be formed by cooling vapor at around 100–220 °C. It is glassy and brittle. It is also a poor electrical conductor.

Arsenic occurs in nature as a <a href="monoisotopic%20element">monoisotopic element</a>, composed of one stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, As. As of 2003, at least 33 <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s have also been synthesized, ranging in <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> from 60 to 92. The most stable of these is As with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 80.30 days. All other isotopes have half-lives of under one day, with the exception of As ("t"=65.30 hours), As ("t"=26.0 hours), As ("t"=17.77 days), As ("t"=1.0942 days), and As ("t"=38.83 hours). Isotopes that are lighter than the stable As tend to decay by <a href="beta%20decay">β decay</a>, and those that are heavier tend to decay by <a href="beta%20decay">β decay</a>, with some exceptions.

At least 10 <a href="nuclear%20isomer">nuclear isomer</a>s have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84. The most stable of arsenic's isomers is As with a half-life of 111 seconds.

Arsenic has a similar electronegativity and ionization energies to its lighter congener phosphorus and as such readily forms covalent molecules with most of the nonmetals. Though stable in dry air, arsenic forms a golden-bronze tarnish upon exposure to humidity which eventually becomes a black surface layer. When heated in air, arsenic <a href="oxidation">oxidizes</a> to <a href="arsenic%20trioxide">arsenic trioxide</a>; the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling <a href="garlic">garlic</a>. This odor can be detected on striking <a href="arsenide">arsenide</a> minerals such as <a href="arsenopyrite">arsenopyrite</a> with a hammer. It burns in oxygen to form arsenic trioxide and <a href="arsenic%20pentoxide">arsenic pentoxide</a>, which have the same structure as the more well-known phosphorus compounds, and in fluorine to give <a href="arsenic%20pentafluoride">arsenic pentafluoride</a>. Arsenic (and some arsenic compounds) <a href="sublimation%20%28chemistry%29">sublimes</a> upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at . The <a href="triple%20point">triple point</a> is 3.63 MPa and . Arsenic makes <a href="arsenic%20acid">arsenic acid</a> with concentrated <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>, <a href="arsenous%20acid">arsenous acid</a> with dilute nitric acid, and <a href="arsenic%20trioxide">arsenic trioxide</a> with concentrated <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>; however, it does not react with water, alkalis, or non-oxidising acids. Arsenic reacts with metals to form <a href="arsenide">arsenide</a>s, though these are not ionic compounds containing the As ion as the formation of such an anion would be highly endothermic and even the group 1 arsenides have properties of <a href="intermetallic">intermetallic</a> compounds. Like <a href="germanium">germanium</a>, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, and <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, which like arsenic <a href="d-block%20contraction">succeed the 3d transition series</a>, arsenic is much less stable in the group oxidation state of +5 than its vertical neighbors phosphorus and antimony, and hence arsenic pentoxide and arsenic acid are potent oxidizers.

Compounds of arsenic resemble in some respects those of <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> which occupies the same <a href="Group%20%28periodic%20table%29">group</a> (column) of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. The most common <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s for arsenic are: −3 in the <a href="arsenide">arsenide</a>s, which are alloy-like intermetallic compounds, +3 in the <a href="arsenite">arsenite</a>s, and +5 in the <a href="arsenates">arsenates</a> and most organoarsenic compounds. Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As ions in the mineral <a href="skutterudite">skutterudite</a>. In the +3 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>, arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the <a href="lone%20pair">lone pair</a> of <a href="electron">electron</a>s.

One of the simplest arsenic compound is the trihydride, the highly toxic, flammable, pyrophoric <a href="arsine">arsine</a> (AsH). This compound is generally regarded as stable, since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of 250–300 °C decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid. Several factors, such as <a href="humidity">humidity</a>, presence of light and certain <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>s (namely <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>) facilitate the rate of decomposition. It oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water, and analogous reactions take place with <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="selenium">selenium</a> instead of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>.

Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, crystalline <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s <a href="Arsenic%20trioxide">AsO</a> ("<a href="white%20arsenic">white arsenic</a>") and <a href="Arsenic%20pentoxide">AsO</a> which are <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions. <a href="Arsenic%20acid">Arsenic(V) acid</a> is a weak acid and the salts are called <a href="arsenate">arsenate</a>s, the most common <a href="arsenic%20contamination%20of%20groundwater">arsenic contamination of groundwater</a>, and a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include <a href="Scheele%27s%20Green">Scheele's Green</a> (cupric hydrogen arsenate, acidic copper arsenate), <a href="calcium%20arsenate">calcium arsenate</a>, and <a href="lead%20hydrogen%20arsenate">lead hydrogen arsenate</a>. These three have been used as <a href="agriculture">agricultural</a> <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s and <a href="poison">poison</a>s.

The protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> and <a href="phosphoric%20acid">phosphoric acid</a>. Unlike <a href="phosphorous%20acid">phosphorous acid</a>, <a href="arsenous%20acid">arsenous acid</a> is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As(OH).

A broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known. Orpiment (<a href="arsenic%20trisulfide">AsS</a>) and realgar (<a href="tetraarsenic%20tetrasulfide">AsS</a>) are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. In AsS, arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in AsS which features As-As bonds so that the total covalency of As is still 3. Both orpiment and realgar, as well as AsS, have selenium analogs; the analogous AsTe is known as the mineral <a href="kalgoorlieite">kalgoorlieite</a>, and the anion AsTe is known as a ligand in <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> complexes.

All trihalides of arsenic(III) are well known except the astatide, which is unknown. <a href="Arsenic%20pentafluoride">Arsenic pentafluoride</a> (AsF) is the only important pentahalide, reflecting the lower stability of the +5 oxidation state; even so, it is a very strong fluorinating and oxidizing agent. (The <a href="Arsenic%20pentachloride">pentachloride</a> is stable only below −50 °C, at which temperature it decomposes to the trichloride, releasing chlorine gas.)

Arsenic is used as the group 5 element in the <a href="III-V%20semiconductor">III-V semiconductor</a>s <a href="gallium%20arsenide">gallium arsenide</a>, <a href="indium%20arsenide">indium arsenide</a>, and <a href="aluminium%20arsenide">aluminium arsenide</a>. The valence electron count of GaAs is the same as a pair of Si atoms, but the <a href="Electronic%20band%20structure">band structure</a> is completely different which results distinct bulk properties. Other arsenic alloys include the II-V semiconductor <a href="cadmium%20arsenide">cadmium arsenide</a>.

A large variety of organoarsenic compounds are known. Several were developed as <a href="Chemical%20weapon">chemical warfare agents</a> during World War I, including <a href="Blister%20agent">vesicants</a> such as <a href="lewisite">lewisite</a> and vomiting agents such as <a href="adamsite">adamsite</a>. <a href="Cacodylic%20acid">Cacodylic acid</a>, which is of historic and practical interest, arises from the <a href="methylation">methylation</a> of arsenic trioxide, a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry. Indeed, <a href="cacodyl">cacodyl</a> was the first organometallic compound known, and was named from the Greek "κακωδἰα" "stink" for its offensive odor; like all arsenic compounds, it is very poisonous.

Arsenic comprises about 1.5 <a href="Parts%20per%20million">ppm</a> (0.00015%) of the <a href="Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a>, and is the 53rd most abundant element.

<a href="Mineral">Mineral</a>s with the formula MAsS and MAs (M = <a href="Iron">Fe</a>, <a href="Nickel">Ni</a>, <a href="Cobalt">Co</a>) are the dominant commercial sources of arsenic, together with <a href="realgar">realgar</a> (an arsenic sulfide mineral) and native arsenic. An illustrative mineral is <a href="arsenopyrite">arsenopyrite</a> (<a href="iron">Fe</a>As<a href="sulfur">S</a>), which is structurally related to <a href="iron%20pyrite">iron pyrite</a>. Many minor As-containing minerals are known. Arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment.

In 2014, China was the top producer of white arsenic with almost 70% world share, followed by <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, and <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, according to the <a href="British%20Geological%20Survey">British Geological Survey</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a>. Most arsenic refinement operations in the US and Europe have closed over environmental concerns. Arsenic is found of the smelter dust from <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a>, and <a href="lead">lead</a> smelters, and is recovered primarily from copper refinement dust.

On <a href="Roasting%20%28metallurgy%29">roasting</a> arsenopyrite in air, arsenic sublimes as arsenic(III) oxide leaving iron oxides, while roasting without air results in the production of metallic arsenic. Further purification from sulfur and other chalcogens is achieved by <a href="Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimation</a> in vacuum, in a hydrogen atmosphere, or by distillation from molten lead-arsenic mixture.

The word "arsenic" has its origin in the <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> word "(al) zarniqa", from the <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> word "zarnikh", meaning "yellow" (literally "gold-colored") and hence "(yellow) <a href="orpiment">orpiment</a>". It was adopted into <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> as "arsenikon" (), a form that is <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a>, being the neuter form of the Greek word "arsenikos" (), meaning "male", "virile". The Greek word was adopted in Latin as "arsenicum", which in French became "arsenic", from which the English word arsenic is taken. Arsenic sulfides (orpiment, <a href="realgar">realgar</a>) and oxides have been known and used since ancient times. <a href="Zosimos%20of%20Panopolis">Zosimos</a> (circa 300 AD) describes roasting "sandarach" (realgar) to obtain "cloud of arsenic" (<a href="arsenic%20trioxide">arsenic trioxide</a>), which he then <a href="redox">reduces</a> to metallic arsenic. As the symptoms of <a href="arsenic%20poisoning">arsenic poisoning</a> were somewhat ill-defined, it was frequently used for <a href="murder">murder</a> until the advent of the <a href="Marsh%20test">Marsh test</a>, a sensitive chemical test for its presence. (Another less sensitive but more general test is the <a href="Reinsch%20test">Reinsch test</a>.) Owing to its use by the ruling class to murder one another and its potency and discreetness, arsenic has been called the "poison of kings" and the "king of poisons".

During the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, arsenic was often included in <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, which made the alloy harder (so-called "<a href="arsenical%20bronze">arsenical bronze</a>").
<a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a> (Albert the Great, 1193–1280) is believed to have been the first to isolate the element from a compound in 1250, by heating soap together with <a href="arsenic%20trisulfide">arsenic trisulfide</a>. In 1649, <a href="Johann%20Schr%C3%B6der">Johann Schröder</a> published two ways of preparing arsenic. Crystals of elemental (native) arsenic are found in nature, although rare.

<a href="Cadet%27s%20fuming%20liquid">Cadet's fuming liquid</a> (impure <a href="cacodyl">cacodyl</a>), often claimed as the first synthetic <a href="Organometallic%20chemistry">organometallic compound</a>, was synthesized in 1760 by <a href="Louis%20Claude%20Cadet%20de%20Gassicourt">Louis Claude Cadet de Gassicourt</a> by the reaction of <a href="potassium%20acetate">potassium acetate</a> with <a href="arsenic%20trioxide">arsenic trioxide</a>.

In the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>, "arsenic" ("white arsenic" or arsenic trioxide) was mixed with <a href="vinegar">vinegar</a> and <a href="chalk">chalk</a> and eaten by women to improve the <a href="complexion">complexion</a> of their faces, making their skin paler to show they did not work in the fields. Arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to "improve their complexion". The accidental use of arsenic in the adulteration of foodstuffs led to <a href="The%20Bradford%20Sweets%20Poisoning">the Bradford sweet poisoning</a> in 1858, which resulted in around 20 deaths.

Two arsenic pigments have been widely used since their discovery – <a href="Paris%20Green">Paris Green</a> and <a href="Scheele%27s%20Green">Scheele's Green</a>. After the toxicity of arsenic became widely known, these chemicals were used less often as pigments and more often as insecticides. In the 1860s, an arsenic byproduct of dye production, London Purple was widely used. This was a solid mixture of arsenic trioxide, aniline, lime, and ferrous oxide, insoluble in water and very toxic by inhalation or ingestion But it was later replaced with Paris Green, another arsenic-based dye. With better understanding of the toxicology mechanism, two other compounds were used starting in the 1890s. <a href="calcium%20arsenate">Arsenite of lime</a> and <a href="arsenate%20of%20lead">arsenate of lead</a> were used widely as insecticides until the discovery of <a href="DDT">DDT</a> in 1942.

The toxicity of arsenic to <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, and <a href="fungi">fungi</a> led to its use as a wood preservative. In the 1930s, a process of treating wood with <a href="chromated%20copper%20arsenate">chromated copper arsenate</a> (also known as CCA or <a href="Tanalith">Tanalith</a>) was invented, and for decades, this treatment was the most extensive industrial use of arsenic. An increased appreciation of the toxicity of arsenic led to a ban of CCA in consumer products in 2004, initiated by the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and United States. However, CCA remains in heavy use in other countries (such as on Malaysian rubber plantations).

Arsenic was also used in various agricultural insecticides and poisons. For example, <a href="lead%20hydrogen%20arsenate">lead hydrogen arsenate</a> was a common insecticide on <a href="fruit%20tree">fruit tree</a>s, but contact with the compound sometimes resulted in <a href="brain%20damage">brain damage</a> among those working the sprayers. In the second half of the 20th century, <a href="monosodium%20methyl%20arsenate">monosodium methyl arsenate</a> (MSMA) and <a href="disodium%20methyl%20arsenate">disodium methyl arsenate</a> (DSMA) – less toxic organic forms of arsenic – replaced lead arsenate in agriculture. These organic arsenicals were in turn phased out by 2013 in all agricultural activities except cotton farming.

The biogeochemistry of arsenic is complex and includes various adsorption and desorption processes. The toxicity of arsenic is connected to its solubility and is affected by pH. Arsenite () is more soluble than arsenate () and is more toxic; however, at a lower pH, arsenate becomes more mobile and toxic. It was found that addition of sulfur, phosphorus, and iron oxides to high-arsenite soils greatly reduces arsenic phytotoxicity.

Arsenic is used as a feed additive in <a href="Poultry%20farming">poultry</a> and <a href="Pig%20farming">swine production</a>, in particular in the U.S. to increase weight gain, improve <a href="feed%20conversion%20ratio">feed efficiency</a>, and to prevent disease. An example is <a href="roxarsone">roxarsone</a>, which had been used as a <a href="broiler">broiler</a> starter by about 70% of U.S. broiler growers. The Poison-Free Poultry Act of 2009 proposed to ban the use of roxarsone in industrial swine and poultry production. Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., which produces roxarsone, voluntarily suspended sales of the drug in response to studies showing elevated levels of inorganic arsenic, a carcinogen, in treated chickens. A successor to Alpharma, <a href="Zoetis">Zoetis</a>, continues to sell <a href="nitarsone">nitarsone</a>, primarily for use in turkeys.

Arsenic is intentionally added to the feed of <a href="chickens">chickens</a> raised for human consumption. Organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than pure arsenic, and promote the growth of chickens. Under some conditions, the arsenic in <a href="chicken%20feed">chicken feed</a> is converted to the toxic inorganic form.

A 2006 study of the remains of the <a href="Australian">Australian</a> racehorse, <a href="Phar%20Lap">Phar Lap</a>, determined that the 1932 death of the famous champion was caused by a massive overdose of arsenic. Sydney veterinarian Percy Sykes stated, "In those days, arsenic was quite a common tonic, usually given in the form of a solution (Fowler's Solution) ... It was so common that I'd reckon 90 per cent of the horses had arsenic in their system."

During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds were used as medicines, including <a href="arsphenamine">arsphenamine</a> (by <a href="Paul%20Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a>) and <a href="arsenic%20trioxide">arsenic trioxide</a> (by <a href="Thomas%20Fowler%20%28inventor%29">Thomas Fowler</a>). Arsphenamine, as well as <a href="neosalvarsan">neosalvarsan</a>, was indicated for <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> and <a href="trypanosomiasis">trypanosomiasis</a>, but has been superseded by modern <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a>.

Arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 500 years, most commonly in the treatment of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, but in medications as diverse as <a href="Fowler%27s%20solution">Fowler's solution</a> in <a href="psoriasis">psoriasis</a>. The US <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> in the year 2000 approved this compound for the treatment of patients with <a href="acute%20promyelocytic%20leukemia">acute promyelocytic leukemia</a> that is resistant to <a href="all-trans%20retinoic%20acid">all-trans retinoic acid</a>.

Recently, researchers have been locating tumors using arsenic-74 (a positron emitter). This isotope produces clearer <a href="Positron%20emission%20tomography">PET scan</a> images than the previous radioactive agent, <a href="iodine">iodine</a>-124, because the body tends to transport iodine to the thyroid gland producing signal noise.

In subtoxic doses, soluble arsenic compounds act as <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s, and were once popular in small doses as medicine by people in the mid-18th to 19th centuries.

The main use of metallic arsenic is in alloying with lead. Lead components in <a href="Automotive%20battery">car batteries</a> are strengthened by the presence of a very small percentage of arsenic. <a href="Selective%20leaching">Dezincification</a> of brass (a copper-zinc alloy) is greatly reduced by the addition of arsenic. "Phosphorus Deoxidized Arsenical Copper" with an arsenic content of 0.3% has an increased corrosion stability in certain environments. <a href="Gallium%20arsenide">Gallium arsenide</a> is an important <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> material, used in <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a>s. Circuits made from GaAs are much faster (but also much more expensive) than those made from <a href="silicon">silicon</a>. Unlike silicon, GaAs has a <a href="direct%20bandgap">direct bandgap</a>, and can be used in <a href="laser%20diode">laser diode</a>s and <a href="LED">LED</a>s to convert <a href="electricity">electrical</a> energy directly into <a href="light">light</a>.

After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the United States built a stockpile of 20,000 tonnes of <a href="Chemical%20warfare">weaponized</a> <a href="lewisite">lewisite</a> (ClCH=CHAsCl), a <a href="vesicant">vesicant</a> (blister agent) and <a href="lung">lung</a> irritant. The stockpile was neutralized with bleach and dumped into the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> in the 1950s. During the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, the United States used <a href="Agent%20Blue">Agent Blue</a>, a mixture of <a href="sodium%20cacodylate">sodium cacodylate</a> and its acid form, as one of the <a href="rainbow%20herbicides">rainbow herbicides</a> to deprive North Vietnamese soldiers of foliage cover and rice.


Some species of <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> obtain their energy by <a href="redox">oxidizing</a> various fuels while <a href="redox">reducing</a> arsenate to arsenite. Under oxidative environmental conditions some bacteria oxidize arsenite to arsenate as fuel for their metabolism. The <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s involved are known as <a href="Arsenate%20reductase%20%28glutaredoxin%29">arsenate reductases</a> (Arr).

In 2000, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> in the absence of oxygen with arsenites as <a href="electron%20donor">electron donor</a>s, producing arsenates (just as ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). This may be classified as chemolithoautotrophic arsenite oxidation, for which oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor, arsenite is the electron donor, and carbon dioxide is the carbon source. Researchers conjecture that, over the course of history, these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. One <a href="strain%20%28biology%29">strain</a> PHS-1 has been isolated and is related to the <a href="gammaproteobacterium">gammaproteobacterium</a> "<a href="Ectothiorhodospira%20shaposhnikovii">Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii</a>". The mechanism is unknown, but an encoded Arr enzyme may function in reverse to its known <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">homologues</a>.

Although the <a href="arsenate">arsenate</a> and <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> anions are similar structurally, no evidence exists for the replacement of phosphate in <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> or <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s by arsenic.

Some evidence indicates that arsenic is an essential trace mineral in birds (chickens), and in mammals (rats, hamsters, and goats). However, the biological function is not known.

Arsenic has been linked to <a href="epigenetics">epigenetic changes</a>, heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>. These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and <a href="RNA">RNA</a> interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes <a href="p16%20%28gene%29">p16</a> and <a href="p53">p53</a>, thus increasing risk of <a href="carcinogenesis">carcinogenesis</a>. These epigenetic events have been studied "in vitro" using human <a href="kidney">kidney</a> cells and "in vivo" using rat <a href="liver">liver</a> cells and peripheral blood <a href="leukocytes">leukocytes</a> in humans. <a href="Inductively%20coupled%20plasma%20mass%20spectrometry">Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry</a> (ICP-MS) is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and other arsenic bases involved in epigenetic modification of DNA. Studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor be used to develop precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility.

The Chinese brake fern ("<a href="Pteris%20vittata">Pteris vittata</a>") hyperaccumulates arsenic from the soil into its leaves and has a proposed use in <a href="phytoremediation">phytoremediation</a>.

Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon entering the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>, are progressively metabolized through a process of <a href="methylation">methylation</a>. For example, the mold "<a href="Scopulariopsis%20brevicaulis">Scopulariopsis brevicaulis</a>" produces significant amounts of <a href="trimethylarsine">trimethylarsine</a> if inorganic arsenic is present. The organic compound <a href="arsenobetaine">arsenobetaine</a> is found in some marine foods such as fish and algae, and also in mushrooms in larger concentrations. The average person's intake is about 10–50 µg/day. Values about 1000 µg are not unusual following consumption of fish or mushrooms, but there is little danger in eating fish because this arsenic compound is nearly non-toxic.

Naturally occurring sources of human exposure include volcanic ash, weathering of minerals and ores, and mineralized groundwater. Arsenic is also found in food, water, soil, and air. Arsenic is absorbed by all plants, but is more concentrated in leafy vegetables, rice, apple and grape juice, and seafood. An additional route of exposure is inhalation of atmospheric gases and dusts.

Extensive arsenic contamination of groundwater has led to widespread <a href="arsenic%20poisoning">arsenic poisoning</a> in <a href="Water%20supply%20and%20sanitation%20in%20Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and neighboring countries. It is estimated that approximately 57 million people in the Bengal basin are drinking <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> with arsenic concentrations elevated above the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>'s standard of 10 <a href="Concentration%23%26quot%3BParts-per%26quot%3B%20notation">parts per billion</a> (ppb). However, a study of cancer rates in Taiwan suggested that significant increases in cancer mortality appear only at levels above 150 ppb. The arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin, and is released from the sediment into the groundwater, caused by the <a href="Dead%20zone%20%28ecology%29">anoxic conditions</a> of the subsurface. This groundwater was used after local and western <a href="Non-governmental%20organization">NGOs</a> and the Bangladeshi government undertook a massive shallow tube <a href="Water%20well">well</a> drinking-water program in the late twentieth century. This program was designed to prevent drinking of bacteria-contaminated surface waters, but failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater. Many other countries and districts in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, such as <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, have geological environments that produce groundwater with a high arsenic content. was reported in <a href="Nakhon%20Si%20Thammarat">Nakhon Si Thammarat</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> in 1987, and the <a href="Chao%20Phraya%20River">Chao Phraya River</a> probably contains high levels of naturally occurring dissolved arsenic without being a public health problem because much of the public uses bottled water. In Pakistan, more than 60 million people are exposed to arsenic polluted drinking water indicated by a recent report of <a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science (journal)</a>. Podgorski’s team investigated more than 1200 samples and more than 66% samples exceeded the WHO minimum contamination level. 

In the United States, arsenic is most commonly found in the ground waters of the southwest. Parts of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and the Dakotas are also known to have significant concentrations of arsenic in ground water. Increased levels of skin cancer have been associated with arsenic exposure in Wisconsin, even at levels below the 10 part per billion drinking water standard. According to a recent film funded by the US <a href="Superfund">Superfund</a>, millions of private wells have unknown arsenic levels, and in some areas of the US, more than 20% of the wells may contain levels that exceed established limits.

Low-level exposure to arsenic at concentrations of 100 parts per billion (i.e., above the 10 parts per billion drinking water standard) compromises the initial immune response to <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H1N1">H1N1 or swine flu</a> infection according to NIEHS-supported scientists. The study, conducted in laboratory mice, suggests that people exposed to arsenic in their drinking water may be at increased risk for more serious illness or death from the virus.

Some Canadians are drinking water that contains inorganic arsenic. Private-dug–well waters are most at risk for containing inorganic arsenic. Preliminary well water analysis typically does not test for arsenic. Researchers at the Geological Survey of Canada have modeled relative variation in natural arsenic hazard potential for the province of New Brunswick. This study has important implications for potable water and health concerns relating to inorganic arsenic.

Epidemiological evidence from <a href="Chile">Chile</a> shows a dose-dependent connection between chronic arsenic exposure and various forms of cancer, in particular when other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, are present. These effects have been demonstrated at contaminations less than 50 ppb. Arsenic is itself a constituent of <a href="tobacco%20smoke">tobacco smoke</a>.

Analyzing multiple epidemiological studies on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests a small but measurable increase in risk for bladder cancer at 10 ppb. According to Peter Ravenscroft of the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge, roughly 80 million people worldwide consume between 10 and 50 ppb arsenic in their drinking water. If they all consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since it does not include lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation.
Early (1973) evaluations of the processes for removing dissolved arsenic from drinking water demonstrated the efficacy of co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. In particular, iron as a coagulant was found to remove arsenic with an efficacy exceeding 90%. Several adsorptive media systems have been approved for use at point-of-service in a study funded by the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (US EPA) and the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> (NSF). A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a> based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left in an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and developing an oxidation zone that supports arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.

Another effective and inexpensive method to avoid arsenic contamination is to sink wells 500 feet or deeper to reach purer waters. A recent 2011 study funded by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Superfund Research Program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and take it out of circulation. In this process, called "adsorption", arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles and is naturally removed from the ground water.

Magnetic separations of arsenic at very low magnetic field <a href="gradient">gradient</a>s with high-surface-area and <a href="monodisperse">monodisperse</a> <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> (FeO) <a href="nanocrystal">nanocrystal</a>s have been demonstrated in point-of-use water purification. Using the high specific surface area of FeO nanocrystals, the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water has been dramatically reduced.

Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of all leading causes of mortality. The literature indicates that arsenic exposure is causative in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Chaff-based filters have recently been shown to reduce the arsenic content of water to 3 µg/L. This may find applications in areas where the potable water is extracted from underground <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>s.

For several centuries, the people of <a href="San%20Pedro%20de%20Atacama">San Pedro de Atacama</a> in <a href="Chile">Chile</a> have been drinking water that is contaminated with arsenic, and some evidence suggests they have developed some immunity.

Around one-third of the world’s population drinks water from groundwater resources. Of this, about 10 percent, approximately 300 million people, obtains water from groundwater resources that are contaminated with unhealthy levels of arsenic or fluoride. These trace elements derive mainly from minerals.

Arsenic is unique among the trace <a href="metalloids">metalloids</a> and oxyanion-forming trace metals (e.g. As, Se, Sb, Mo, V, Cr, U, Re). It is sensitive to mobilization at pH values typical of natural waters (pH 6.5–8.5) under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states (−3, 0, +3 and +5), but in natural waters it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite [As(III)] or pentavalent arsenate [As(V)]. Organic forms of arsenic are produced by biological activity, mostly in surface waters, but are rarely quantitatively important. Organic arsenic compounds may, however, occur where waters are signiﬁcantly impacted by industrial pollution.

Arsenic may be solubilized by various processes. When pH is high, arsenic may be released from surface binding sites that lose their positive charge. When water level drops and <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a> minerals are exposed to air, arsenic trapped in sulfide minerals can be released into water. When organic carbon is present in water, bacteria are fed by directly reducing As(V) to As(III) or by reducing the element at the binding site, releasing inorganic arsenic.

The aquatic transformations of arsenic are affected by pH, reduction-oxidation potential, organic matter concentration and the concentrations and forms of other elements, especially iron and manganese. The main factors are pH and the redox potential. Generally, the main forms of arsenic under oxic conditions are HAsO, HAsO, HAsO, and AsO at pH 2, 2–7, 7–11 and 11, respectively. Under reducing conditions, HAsO is predominant at pH 2–9.

Oxidation and reduction affects the migration of arsenic in subsurface environments. Arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than arsenite, is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions. The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds. As a result, the <a href="adsorption">adsorption</a> of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. That is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments.

The presence of sulfur is another factor that affects the transformation of arsenic in natural water. Arsenic can <a href="precipitate">precipitate</a> when metal sulfides form. In this way, arsenic is removed from the water and its mobility decreases. When oxygen is present, bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur to generate energy, potentially releasing bound arsenic.

Redox reactions involving Fe also appear to be essential factors in the fate of arsenic in aquatic systems. The reduction of iron oxyhydroxides plays a key role in the release of arsenic to water. So arsenic can be enriched in water with elevated Fe concentrations. Under oxidizing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized from <a href="pyrite">pyrite</a> or iron oxides especially at elevated pH. Under reducing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized by reductive desorption or dissolution when associated with iron oxides. The reductive desorption occurs under two circumstances. One is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly. The other results from a change in the charge on the mineral surface which leads to the desorption of bound arsenic.

Some species of bacteria catalyze redox transformations of arsenic. Dissimilatory arsenate-respiring prokaryotes (DARP) speed up the reduction of As(V) to As(III). DARP use As(V) as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive. Other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process. <a href="Chemoautotrophic">Chemoautotrophic</a> arsenite oxidizers (CAO) and <a href="heterotrophic">heterotrophic</a> arsenite oxidizers (HAO) convert As(III) into As(V). CAO combine the oxidation of As(III) with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate. They use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from CO. HAO cannot obtain energy from As(III) oxidation. This process may be an arsenic <a href="detoxification">detoxification</a> mechanism for the bacteria.

Equilibrium thermodynamic calculations predict that As(V) concentrations should be greater than As(III) concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions, i.e. where SO reduction is occurring. However, abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow. Oxidation of As(III) by dissolved O is a particularly slow reaction. For example, Johnson and Pilson (1975) gave <a href="Half-life">half-lives</a> for the oxygenation of As(III) in seawater ranging from several months to a year. In other studies, As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation, again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates. Cherry found from experimental studies that the As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to 3 weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales. Sterile water samples have been observed to be less susceptible to speciation changes than non-sterile samples. Oremland found that the reduction of As(V) to As(III) in Mono Lake was rapidly catalyzed by bacteria with rate constants ranging from 0.02 to 0.3 day.

As of 2002, US-based industries consumed 19,600 metric tons of arsenic. Ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with <a href="chromated%20copper%20arsenate">chromated copper arsenate</a> (CCA). In 2007, 50% of the 5,280 metric tons of consumption was still used for this purpose. In the United States, the voluntary phasing-out of arsenic in production of consumer products and residential and general consumer construction products began on 31 December 2003, and alternative chemicals are now used, such as <a href="Alkaline%20Copper%20Quaternary">Alkaline Copper Quaternary</a>, <a href="borate">borate</a>s, <a href="Wood%20preservation%23Copper%20azole">copper azole</a>, cyproconazole, and <a href="propiconazole">propiconazole</a>.

Although discontinued, this application is also one of the most concern to the general public. The vast majority of older <a href="Timber%20treatment">pressure-treated</a> wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor <a href="building%20material">building material</a>. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding <a href="soil">soil</a> (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber. The direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt CCA lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans; the lethal human dose is approximately 20 grams of ash. Scrap CCA lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires. Protocols for safe disposal of CCA lumber are not consistent throughout the world. Widespread <a href="landfill">landfill</a> disposal of such timber raises some concern, but other studies have shown no arsenic contamination in the groundwater.

One tool that maps the location (and other information) of arsenic releases in the United State is <a href="TOXMAP">TOXMAP</a>. TOXMAP is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Library%20of%20Medicine">United States National Library of Medicine</a> (NLM) funded by the US Federal Government. With marked-up maps of the United States, TOXMAP enables users to visually explore data from the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>'s (EPA) <a href="Toxics%20Release%20Inventory">Toxics Release Inventory</a> and <a href="Superfund%20Basic%20Research%20Program">Superfund Basic Research Program</a>s. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET), <a href="PubMed">PubMed</a>, and from other authoritative sources.

Physical, chemical, and biological methods have been used to remediate arsenic contaminated water. Bioremediation is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor. This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via <a href="phytoremediation">phytoremediation</a> but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.

Bioremediation requires careful evaluation and design in accordance with existing conditions. Some sites may require the addition of an electron acceptor while others require microbe supplementation (<a href="bioaugmentation">bioaugmentation</a>). Regardless of the method used, only constant monitoring can prevent future contamination.

Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons.

Elemental arsenic and arsenic compounds are classified as "<a href="toxicity">toxic</a>" and "dangerous for the environment" in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> under <a href="directive%2067/548/EEC">directive 67/548/EEC</a>.

The <a href="International%20Agency%20for%20Research%20on%20Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (IARC) recognizes arsenic and arsenic compounds as <a href="List%20of%20IARC%20Group%201%20carcinogens">group 1 carcinogens</a>, and the EU lists arsenic trioxide, <a href="arsenic%20pentoxide">arsenic pentoxide</a>, and <a href="arsenate">arsenate</a> salts as category 1 <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>s.

Arsenic is known to cause when present in drinking water, "the most common species being arsenate [; As(V)] and arsenite [HAsO; As(III)]".

In the United States since 2006, the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) is 10 ppb and the FDA set the same standard in 2005 for bottled water. The Department of Environmental Protection for New Jersey set a drinking water limit of 5 ppb in 2006. The <a href="IDLH">IDLH</a> (immediately dangerous to life and health) value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is 5 mg/m. The <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> has set the <a href="permissible%20exposure%20limit">permissible exposure limit</a> (PEL) to a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.01 mg/m, and the <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) has set the <a href="recommended%20exposure%20limit">recommended exposure limit</a> (REL) to a 15-minute constant exposure of 0.002 mg/m. The PEL for organic arsenic compounds is a TWA of 0.5 mg/m.

In 2008, based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of American foods for toxic chemicals, the U.S. <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> set the "level of concern" for inorganic arsenic apple and pear juices at 23 ppb, based on non-carcinogenic effects, and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level; it also required recalls for non-conforming domestic products. In 2011, the national "<a href="Dr.%20Oz">Dr. Oz</a>" television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers. Though the methodology was disputed (it did not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic) the tests showed levels of arsenic up to 36 ppb. In response, FDA tested the worst brand from the "Dr." "Oz" show and found much lower levels. Ongoing testing found 95% of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern. Later testing by <a href="Consumer%20Reports">Consumer Reports</a> showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above 10 ppb, and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption. In July 2013, on consideration of consumption by children, chronic exposure, and carcinogenic effect, the FDA established an "action level" of 10 ppb for apple juice, the same as the drinking water standard.

Concern about arsenic in rice in Bangladesh was raised in 2002, but at the time only Australia had a legal limit for food (one milligram per kilogram). Concern was raised about people who were eating U.S. rice exceeding WHO standards for personal arsenic intake in 2005. In 2011, the People's Republic of China set a food standard of 150 ppb for arsenic.

In the United States in 2012, testing by separate groups of researchers at the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center at <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a> (early in the year, focusing on urinary levels in children) and <a href="Consumer%20Reports">Consumer Reports</a> (in November) found levels of arsenic in rice that resulted in calls for the FDA to set limits. The FDA released some testing results in September 2012, and as of July 2013, is still collecting data in support of a new potential regulation. It has not recommended any changes in consumer behavior.

Consumer Reports recommended: 
A 2014 <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> advisory conference was scheduled to consider limits of 200–300 ppb for rice.

Arsenic is bioaccumulative in many organisms, marine species in particular, but it does not appear to biomagnify significantly in food webs. In polluted areas, plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate, which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells. In polluted areas, uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion (found more particularly in reducing conditions) is likely in poorly-drained soils.

Arsenic's toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic(III) oxides for <a href="thiol">thiol</a>s. Thiols, in the form of <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a> residues and <a href="Cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29">cofactors</a> such as <a href="lipoic%20acid">lipoic acid</a> and <a href="coenzyme%20A">coenzyme A</a>, are situated at the active sites of many important <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s.

Arsenic disrupts <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> production through several mechanisms. At the level of the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>, arsenic inhibits <a href="lipoic%20acid">lipoic acid</a>, which is a cofactor for <a href="pyruvate%20dehydrogenase">pyruvate dehydrogenase</a>. By competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a>, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of <a href="Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide">NAD+</a>, mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system <a href="organ%20failure">organ failure</a>. The organ failure is presumed to be from <a href="necrotic">necrotic</a> cell death, not <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>, since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur.
Although arsenic causes toxicity it can also play a protective role.

Occupational exposure and <a href="arsenic%20poisoning">arsenic poisoning</a> may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds, such as wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.

The conversion between As(III) and As(V) is a large factor in arsenic environmental contamination. According to Croal, Gralnick, Malasarn and Newman, "[the] understanding [of] what stimulates As(III) oxidation and/or limits As(V) reduction is relevant for <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a> of contaminated sites (Croal). The study of chemolithoautotrophic As(III) oxidizers and the heterotrophic As(V) reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and/or reduction of arsenic.

Treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is possible. British anti-lewisite (<a href="dimercaprol">dimercaprol</a>) is prescribed in doses of 5 mg/kg up to 300 mg every 4 hours for the first day, then every 6 hours for the second day, and finally every 8 hours for 8 additional days. However the USA's <a href="Agency%20for%20Toxic%20Substances%20and%20Disease%20Registry">Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry</a> (ATSDR) states that the long-term effects of arsenic exposure cannot be predicted. Blood, urine, hair, and nails may be tested for arsenic; however, these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure. Long-term exposure and consequent excretion through urine has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver, prostate, skin, lungs, and nasal cavity.

Antimony

Antimony is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Sb (from ) and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 51. A lustrous gray <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a>, it is found in nature mainly as the <a href="sulfide%20mineral">sulfide mineral</a> <a href="stibnite">stibnite</a> (SbS). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, <a href="Kohl%20%28cosmetics%29">kohl</a>. Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as <a href="lead">lead</a> upon its discovery. In the West, it was first isolated by <a href="Vannoccio%20Biringuccio">Vannoccio Biringuccio</a> and described in 1540.

For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the <a href="Xikuangshan%20Mine">Xikuangshan Mine</a> in <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a>. The industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and <a href="carbothermic%20reaction">reduction with carbon</a> or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.

The largest applications for metallic antimony is an alloy with <a href="lead">lead</a> and <a href="tin">tin</a> and the lead antimony plates in <a href="lead%E2%80%93acid%20battery">lead–acid batteries</a>. Alloys of lead and tin with antimony have improved properties for <a href="solder">solder</a>s, <a href="bullet">bullet</a>s, and <a href="plain%20bearing">plain bearing</a>s. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing <a href="fire%20retardant">fire retardant</a>s found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application is the use of antimony in <a href="microelectronics">microelectronics</a>.

Antimony is in a <a href="pnictogen">pnictogen</a> (a member of group 15) and has an <a href="electronegativity">electronegativity</a> of 2.05. In accordance with periodic trends, it is more electronegative than <a href="tin">tin</a> or <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>, and less electronegative than <a href="tellurium">tellurium</a> or <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>. Antimony is stable in air at room temperature, but reacts with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> if heated to produce <a href="antimony%20trioxide">antimony trioxide</a>, SbO.

Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metalloid with a <a href="Mohs%20scale">Mohs scale</a> hardness of 3, which is too soft to make hard objects; coins of antimony were issued in China's <a href="Guizhou">Guizhou</a> province in 1931 but the durability was poor and the minting was soon discontinued. Antimony is resistant to attack by acids.

Four <a href="allotropy">allotropes</a> of antimony are known: a stable metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Elemental antimony is a <a href="brittle">brittle</a>, silver-white shiny metalloid. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a <a href="trigonal">trigonal</a> cell, <a href="isomorphic">isomorphic</a> with the gray allotrope of <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>. A rare <a href="explosive%20form%20of%20antimony">explosive form of antimony</a> can be formed from the electrolysis of <a href="antimony%20trichloride">antimony trichloride</a>. When scratched with a sharp implement, an <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a> reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor. It has the same crystal structure as <a href="red%20phosphorus">red phosphorus</a> and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100 °C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of <a href="stibine">stibine</a> (SbH) at −90 °C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this <a href="metastability">metastable</a> allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.

Elemental antimony adopts a layered structure (<a href="space%20group">space group</a> Rm No. 166) in which layers consist of fused, ruffled, six-membered rings. The nearest and next-nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex, with the three atoms in each double layer slightly closer than the three atoms in the next. This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 6.697 g/cm, but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony.

Antimony has two stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s: Sb with a natural abundance of 57.36% and Sb with a natural abundance of 42.64%. It also has 35 radioisotopes, of which the longest-lived is Sb with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 2.75 years. In addition, 29 <a href="nuclear%20isomer">metastable</a> states have been characterized. The most stable of these is Sb with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 5.76 days. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable Sb tend to decay by <a href="beta%20decay">β decay</a>, and those that are heavier tend to decay by <a href="beta%20decay">β decay</a>, with some exceptions.

The abundance of antimony in the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s crust is estimated to be 0.2 to 0.5 <a href="part%20per%20million">parts per million</a>, comparable to <a href="thallium">thallium</a> at 0.5 parts per million and silver at 0.07 ppm. Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in more than 100 <a href="mineral">mineral</a> species. Antimony is sometimes found natively (e.g. on <a href="Antimony%20Peak">Antimony Peak</a>), but more frequently it is found in the sulfide <a href="stibnite">stibnite</a> (SbS) which is the predominant ore <a href="mineral">mineral</a>.

Antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state: Sb(III) and Sb(V). The +5 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> is more stable.

<a href="Antimony%20trioxide">Antimony trioxide</a> is formed when antimony is burnt in air. In the gas phase, the molecule of the compound is , but it polymerizes upon condensing. <a href="Antimony%20pentoxide">Antimony pentoxide</a> () can be formed only by oxidation with concentrated <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>. Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, <a href="antimony%20tetroxide">antimony tetroxide</a> (), which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V). Unlike oxides of <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, these oxides are <a href="amphoteric">amphoteric</a>, do not form well-defined <a href="oxoacid">oxoacid</a>s, and react with acids to form antimony salts.

Antimonous acid is unknown, but the conjugate base sodium antimonite () forms upon fusing <a href="sodium%20oxide">sodium oxide</a> and . Transition metal antimonites are also known. Antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate , forming salts as the antimonate anion . When a solution containing this anion is dehydrated, the precipitate contains mixed oxides.

Many antimony ores are sulfides, including <a href="stibnite">stibnite</a> (), <a href="pyrargyrite">pyrargyrite</a> (), <a href="zinkenite">zinkenite</a>, <a href="jamesonite">jamesonite</a>, and <a href="boulangerite">boulangerite</a>. <a href="Antimony%20pentasulfide">Antimony pentasulfide</a> is <a href="non-stoichiometric%20compound">non-stoichiometric</a> and features antimony in the +3 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> and S-S bonds. Several thioantimonides are known, such as and .

Antimony forms two series of <a href="halide">halide</a>s: and . The trihalides <a href="antimony%20trifluoride"></a>, <a href="antimony%20trichloride"></a>, <a href="antimony%20tribromide"></a>, and <a href="antimony%20triiodide"></a> are all molecular compounds having <a href="trigonal%20pyramidal%20molecular%20geometry">trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry</a>.

The trifluoride <a href="antimony%20trifluoride"></a> is prepared by the reaction of <a href="antimony%20trioxide"></a> with <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">HF</a>:

It is <a href="Lewis%20acid">Lewis acid</a>ic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions and . Molten <a href="antimony%20trifluoride"></a> is a weak <a href="electrical%20conductor">electrical conductor</a>. The trichloride <a href="antimony%20trichloride"></a> is prepared by dissolving <a href="stibnite"></a> in <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>:
The pentahalides <a href="antimony%20pentafluoride"></a> and <a href="antimony%20pentachloride"></a> have <a href="trigonal%20bipyramidal%20molecular%20geometry">trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry</a> in the gas phase, but in the liquid phase, <a href="antimony%20pentafluoride"></a> is <a href="polymer">polymer</a>ic, whereas <a href="antimony%20pentachloride"></a> is monomeric. <a href="Antimony%20pentafluoride"></a> is a powerful Lewis acid used to make the <a href="superacid">superacid</a> <a href="fluoroantimonic%20acid">fluoroantimonic acid</a> ("HSbF").

<a href="Oxohalide">Oxyhalides</a> are more common for antimony than for arsenic and phosphorus. <a href="Antimony%20trioxide">Antimony trioxide</a> dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as SbOCl and .

Compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of Sb. Antimony forms <a href="antimonide">antimonide</a>s with metals, such as <a href="indium%20antimonide">indium antimonide</a> (InSb) and silver antimonide (). The alkali metal and zinc antimonides, such as NaSb and ZnSb, are more reactive. Treating these antimonides with acid produces the unstable gas <a href="stibine">stibine</a>, :
Stibine can also be produced by treating salts with hydride reagents such as <a href="sodium%20borohydride">sodium borohydride</a>. Stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature. Because stibine has a positive <a href="heat%20of%20formation">heat of formation</a>, it is <a href="thermodynamic%20stability">thermodynamically unstable</a> and thus antimony does not react with <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> directly.

<a href="Organoantimony%20chemistry">Organoantimony compounds</a> are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with <a href="Grignard%20reagent">Grignard reagent</a>s. A large variety of compounds are known with both Sb(III) and Sb(V) centers, including mixed chloro-organic derivatives, anions, and cations. Examples include Sb(CH) (<a href="triphenylstibine">triphenylstibine</a>), Sb(CH) (with an Sb-Sb bond), and cyclic [Sb(CH)]. Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common, examples being Sb(CH) and several related halides.

<a href="Antimony%28III%29%20sulfide">Antimony(III) sulfide</a>, SbS, was recognized in <a href="predynastic%20Egypt">predynastic Egypt</a> as an eye cosmetic (<a href="kohl%20%28cosmetics%29">kohl</a>) as early as about <a href="4th%20millennium%20BC">3100 BC</a>, when the <a href="cosmetic%20palette">cosmetic palette</a> was invented.

An artifact, said to be part of a vase, made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at <a href="Girsu">Telloh</a>, <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a> (part of present-day <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Austen, at a lecture by Herbert Gladstone in 1892 commented that "we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal, which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase, and therefore this remarkable 'find' (artifact mentioned above) must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable."

Moorey was unconvinced the artifact was indeed a vase, mentioning that Selimkhanov, after his analysis of the Tello object (published in 1975), "attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony" (i.e. native metal) and that "the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments." This weakens the evidence for a lost art "of rendering antimony malleable."

The Roman scholar <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> described several ways of preparing antimony sulfide for medical purposes in his treatise <a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">"Natural History"</a>. Pliny the Elder also made a distinction between "male" and "female" forms of antimony; the male form is probably the sulfide, while the female form, which is superior, heavier, and less friable, has been suspected to be native metallic antimony.

The Roman naturalist <a href="Pedanius%20Dioscorides">Pedanius Dioscorides</a> mentioned that antimony sulfide could be roasted by heating by a current of air. It is thought that this produced metallic antimony.

The first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the 1540 book "<a href="De%20la%20pirotechnia">De la pirotechnia</a>" by <a href="Vannoccio%20Biringuccio">Vannoccio Biringuccio</a>, predating the more famous 1556 book by <a href="Georg%20Agricola">Agricola</a>, "<a href="De%20re%20metallica">De re metallica</a>". In this context Agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony. The book "Currus Triumphalis Antimonii" (The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony), describing the preparation of metallic antimony, was published in Germany in 1604. It was purported to be written by a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monk, writing under the name <a href="Basilius%20Valentinus">Basilius Valentinus</a> in the 15th century; if it were authentic, which it is not, it would predate Biringuccio.

The metal antimony was known to German chemist <a href="Andreas%20Libavius">Andreas Libavius</a> in 1615 who obtained it by adding iron to a molten mixture of antimony sulfide, salt and potassium <a href="tartrate">tartrate</a>. This procedure produced antimony with a crystalline or starred surface.

With the advent of challenges to <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a>, it was recognized that antimony is an element forming sulfides, oxides, and other compounds, as do other metals.

The first natural occurrence of pure antimony in the <a href="Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a> was described by the <a href="Swedish%20people">Swedish</a> scientist and local mine district engineer <a href="Anton%20von%20Swab">Anton von Swab</a> in 1783; the <a href="type%20locality%20%28geology%29">type-sample</a> was collected from the <a href="Sala%20Silver%20Mine">Sala Silver Mine</a> in the Bergslagen mining district of <a href="Sala%20Municipality%2C%20Sweden">Sala</a>, <a href="V%C3%A4stmanland%20County">Västmanland</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>.

The medieval Latin form, from which the modern languages and late <a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a> take their names for antimony, is "antimonium". The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The <a href="popular%20etymology">popular etymology</a>, from ἀντίμοναχός "anti-monachos" or French "antimoine", still has adherents; this would mean "monk-killer", and is explained by many early <a href="alchemist">alchemist</a>s being monks, and antimony being poisonous.

Another popular etymology is the hypothetical Greek word ἀντίμόνος "antimonos", "against aloneness", explained as "not found as metal", or "not found unalloyed". Lippmann conjectured a hypothetical Greek word ανθήμόνιον "anthemonion", which would mean "floret", and cites several examples of related Greek words (but not that one) which describe chemical or biological <a href="efflorescence">efflorescence</a>.

The early uses of "antimonium" include the translations, in 1050–1100, by <a href="Constantine%20the%20African">Constantine the African</a> of Arabic medical treatises. Several authorities believe "antimonium" is a scribal corruption of some Arabic form; Meyerhof derives it from "ithmid"; other possibilities include "athimar", the Arabic name of the metalloid, and a hypothetical "as-stimmi", derived from or parallel to the Greek.

The standard chemical symbol for antimony (Sb) is credited to <a href="J%C3%B6ns%20Jakob%20Berzelius">Jöns Jakob Berzelius</a>, who derived the abbreviation from "stibium".

The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, <a href="kohl%20%28cosmetics%29">kohl</a>, the sulfide of antimony.
The Egyptians called antimony "mśdmt"; in <a href="hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a>, the vowels are uncertain, but an Arabic tradition holds that the word is ميسديميت "mesdemet". The Greek word, στίμμι "stimmi", is probably a <a href="loan%20word">loan word</a> from Arabic or from Egyptian "stm" O34:D46-G17-F21:D4 and is used by <a href="Attica">Attic</a> <a href="tragedy">tragic</a> <a href="poet">poet</a>s of the 5th century BC. Later Greeks also used στἰβι "stibi", as did <a href="Aulus%20Cornelius%20Celsus">Celsus</a> and <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a>, writing in Latin, in the first century AD. Pliny also gives the names "stimi" , "larbaris", <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a>, and the "very common" "platyophthalmos", "wide-eye" (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as "stibium". The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as إثمد "ithmid, athmoud, othmod", or "uthmod". <a href="Littr%C3%A9">Littré</a> suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from "stimmida", an accusative for "stimmi".

The <a href="British%20Geological%20Survey">British Geological Survey</a> (BGS) reported that in 2005, China was the top producer of antimony with approximately 84% of the world share, followed at a distance by South Africa, Bolivia and Tajikistan. <a href="Xikuangshan%20Mine">Xikuangshan Mine</a> in <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a> province has the largest deposits in China with an estimated deposit of 2.1 million metric tons.

In 2016, according to the <a href="US%20Geological%20Survey">US Geological Survey</a>, China accounted for 76.9% of total antimony production, followed in second place by Russia with 6.9% and Tajikistan with 6.2%.

Chinese production of antimony is expected to decline in the future as mines and smelters are closed down by the government as part of pollution control. Especially due to a new environmental protection law having gone into effect on January 2015 and revised “Emission Standards of Pollutants for Stanum, Antimony, and Mercury”having gone into effect, hurdles for economic production are higher. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in China, by September 2015 50% of antimony production capacity in the Hunan province (the province with biggest antimony reserves in China) had not been used.

Reported production of antimony in China has fallen and is unlikely to increase in the coming years, according to the Roskill report. No significant antimony deposits in China have been developed for about ten years, and the remaining economic reserves are being rapidly depleted.

The world's largest antimony producers, according to Roskill, are listed below:

According to statistics from the USGS, current global reserves of antimony will be depleted in 13 years. However, the USGS expects more resources will be found.

The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality and composition of the ore. Most antimony is mined as the sulfide; lower-grade ores are concentrated by <a href="froth%20flotation">froth flotation</a>, while higher-grade ores are heated to 500–600 °C, the temperature at which stibnite melts and separates from the <a href="gangue">gangue</a> minerals. Antimony can be isolated from the crude antimony sulfide by reduction with scrap iron:

The sulfide is converted to an oxide; the product is then roasted, sometimes for the purpose of vaporizing the volatile antimony(III) oxide, which is recovered. This material is often used directly for the main applications, impurities being arsenic and sulfide. Antimony is isolated from the oxide by a carbothermal reduction:

The lower-grade ores are reduced in <a href="blast%20furnace">blast furnace</a>s while the higher-grade ores are reduced in <a href="reverberatory%20furnace">reverberatory furnace</a>s.

Antimony has consistently been ranked high in European and US Risk Lists concerning criticality of the element indicating the relative risk to the supply of chemical elements or element groups required to maintain the current economy and lifestyle.

With most of the antimony imported into Europe and the US coming from China, Chinese production is critical to supply. As China is revising and increasing environmental control standards, antimony production is becoming increasingly restricted. Additionally Chinese export quotas for antimony have been decreasing in the past years. These two factors increase supply risk for both Europe and US.

According to the BGS Risk List 2015, antimony is ranked second highest (after rare earth elements) on the relative supply risk index. This indicates that it has currently the second highest supply risk for chemical elements or element groups which are of economic value to the British economy and lifestyle.
Furthermore, antimony was identified as one of 20 critical raw materials for the EU in a report published in 2014 (which revised the initial report published in 2011). As seen in Figure xxx antimony maintains high supply risk relative to its economic importance. 92% of the antimony is imported from China, which is a significantly high concentration of production.

Much analysis has been conducted in the U.S. toward defining which metals should be called strategic or critical to the nation's security. Exact definitions do not exist, and views as to what constitutes a strategic or critical mineral to U.S. security diverge.

In 2015, no antimony was mined in the U.S. The metal is imported from foreign countries. From 2011-2014 68% of America's antimony came from China, 14% from India, 4% from Mexico, and 14% from other sources. There are no government stockpiles in place currently.

The U.S. “Subcommittee on Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chains” has screened 78 mineral resources from 1996-2008. It found that a small subset of minerals including antimony has fallen into the category of potentially critical minerals consistently. In the future, a second assessment will be made of the found subset of minerals to identify which should be defined of significant risk and critical to U.S. interests.

About 60% of antimony is consumed in <a href="flame%20retardant">flame retardant</a>s, and 20% is used in alloys for batteries, plain bearings, and solders.

Antimony is mainly used in the <a href="antimony%20trioxide">trioxide</a> for <a href="flame%20retardant">flame-proofing compounds</a>, always in combination with halogenated flame retardants except in halogen-containing polymers. The flame retarding effect of antimony trioxide is produced by the formation of halogenated antimony compounds, which react with hydrogen atoms, and probably also with oxygen atoms and OH radicals, thus inhibiting fire. Markets for these flame-retardants include children's clothing, toys, aircraft, and automobile seat covers. They are also added to <a href="polyester%20resin">polyester resin</a>s in <a href="glass-reinforced%20plastic">fiberglass</a> <a href="composite%20material">composites</a> for such items as light aircraft engine covers. The resin will burn in the presence of an externally generated flame, but will extinguish when the external flame is removed.

Antimony forms a highly useful <a href="alloy">alloy</a> with <a href="lead">lead</a>, increasing its hardness and mechanical strength. For most applications involving lead, varying amounts of antimony are used as alloying metal. In <a href="lead%E2%80%93acid%20batteries">lead–acid batteries</a>, this addition improves the charging characteristics and reduces generation of unwanted hydrogen during charging. It is used in antifriction alloys (such as <a href="Babbitt%20metal">Babbitt metal</a>), in <a href="bullet">bullet</a>s and <a href="lead%20shot">lead shot</a>, <a href="electrical%20cable">electrical cable</a> sheathing, <a href="type%20metal">type metal</a> (for example, for <a href="Linotype%20machine">linotype</a> printing machines), <a href="solder">solder</a> (some "<a href="ROHS">lead-free</a>" solders contain 5% Sb), in <a href="pewter">pewter</a>, and in hardening alloys with low <a href="tin">tin</a> content in the manufacturing of <a href="organ%20pipe">organ pipe</a>s.

Three other applications consume nearly all the rest of the world's supply. One application is a stabilizer and a catalyst for the production of <a href="polyethyleneterephthalate">polyethyleneterephthalate</a>. Another is a fining agent to remove microscopic bubbles in <a href="glass">glass</a>, mostly for TV screens; antimony ions interact with oxygen, suppressing the tendency of the latter to form bubbles. The third application is pigments.

Antimony is increasingly being used in <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a>s as a <a href="dopant">dopant</a> in <a href="N-type%20semiconductor">n-type</a> <a href="silicon">silicon</a> <a href="wafer%20%28electronics%29">wafers</a> for <a href="diode">diode</a>s, <a href="infrared">infrared</a> detectors, and <a href="Hall%20effect">Hall-effect</a> devices. In the 1950s, the emitters and collectors of n-p-n <a href="alloy%20junction%20transistor">alloy junction transistor</a>s were doped with tiny beads of a <a href="lead">lead</a>-antimony alloy. <a href="Indium%20antimonide">Indium antimonide</a> is used as a material for mid-<a href="infrared%20detector">infrared detector</a>s.

Biology and medicine have few uses for antimony. Treatments containing antimony, known as <a href="antimonial">antimonial</a>s, are used as <a href="emetic">emetic</a>s. Antimony compounds are used as <a href="antiprotozoal%20agent">antiprotozoan</a> drugs. <a href="Potassium%20antimonyl%20tartrate">Potassium antimonyl tartrate</a>, or tartar emetic, was once used as an anti-<a href="schistosomiasis">schistosomal</a> drug from 1919 on. It was subsequently replaced by <a href="praziquantel">praziquantel</a>. Antimony and its compounds are used in several <a href="veterinary">veterinary</a> preparations, such as anthiomaline and lithium antimony thiomalate, as a skin conditioner in <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s. Antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on <a href="keratinized">keratinized</a> tissues in animals.

Antimony-based drugs, such as <a href="meglumine%20antimoniate">meglumine antimoniate</a>, are also considered the drugs of choice for treatment of <a href="leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a> in <a href="domestic%20animal">domestic animal</a>s. Unfortunately, besides having low <a href="therapeutic%20index">therapeutic indices</a>, the drugs have minimal penetration of the <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a>, where some of the "Leishmania" <a href="amastigote">amastigote</a>s reside, and curing the disease – especially the visceral form – is very difficult. Elemental antimony as an <a href="antimony%20pill">antimony pill</a> was once used as a medicine. It could be reused by others after ingestion and elimination.

<a href="Antimony%28III%29%20sulfide">Antimony(III) sulfide</a> is used in the heads of some <a href="safety%20match">safety match</a>es.

Antimony sulfides help to stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad materials.

Antimony is used in bullets, bullet tracers, paint, glass art, and as an <a href="opacifier">opacifier</a> in <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>.

<a href="Antimony-124">Antimony-124</a> is used together with <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> in <a href="neutron%20source">neutron source</a>s; the <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s emitted by antimony-124 initiate the <a href="photodisintegration">photodisintegration</a> of beryllium. The emitted neutrons have an average energy of 24 keV. Natural antimony is used in <a href="startup%20neutron%20source">startup neutron source</a>s.

The effects of antimony and its compounds on human and environmental health differ widely. The elemental antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health. Inhalation of antimony trioxide (and similar poorly soluble Sb(III) dust particles such as antimony dust) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer. However, these effects are only observed with female rats and after long-term exposure to high dust concentrations. The effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble Sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance, lung overload, inflammation and ultimately tumour formation, not to exposure to antimony ions (OECD, 2008). Antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin. The effects of antimony are not comparable to arsenic; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake, metabolism and excretion between arsenic and antimony.

For oral absorption, ICRP (1994) recommended values of 10% for tartar emetic and 1% for all other antimony compounds. Dermal absorption for metals is estimated at most 1% (HERAG, 2007). Inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble Sb(III) substances (such as antimony dust) is estimated at 6.8% (OECD, 2008), whereas a value <1% is derived for Sb(V) substances. Antimony(V) is not quantitatively reduced to antimony(III) in the cell, and both species exist simultaneously.

Antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine. Antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects, with the exception of <a href="antimony%20potassium%20tartrate">antimony potassium tartrate</a> ("tartar emetic"), a prodrug that is intentionally used to treat <a href="leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a> patients.

Prolonged skin contact with antimony dust may cause dermatitis. However, it was agreed at the European Union level that the skin rashes observed are not substance-specific, but most probably due to a physical blocking of sweat ducts (ECHA/PR/09/09, Helsinki, 6 July 2009). Antimony dust may also be explosive when dispersed in the air; when in a bulk solid it is not combustible.

Antimony is incompatible with strong acids, halogenated acids, and oxidizers; when exposed to newly formed hydrogen it may form <a href="stibine">stibine</a> (SbH).

The 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) is set at 0.5 mg/m by the <a href="American%20Conference%20of%20Governmental%20Industrial%20Hygienists">American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists</a> and by the <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) as a legal <a href="permissible%20exposure%20limit">permissible exposure limit</a> (PEL) in the workplace. The <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) has set a <a href="recommended%20exposure%20limit">recommended exposure limit</a> (REL) of 0.5 mg/m as an 8 hour TWA. Antimony compounds are used as catalysts for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) production. Some studies report minor antimony leaching from PET bottles into liquids, but levels are below drinking water guidelines. Antimony concentrations in fruit juice concentrates were somewhat higher (up to 44.7 µg/L of antimony), but juices do not fall under the drinking water regulations. The drinking water guidelines are:


The TDI proposed by WHO is 6 µg antimony per kilogram of body weight. The <a href="IDLH">IDLH</a> (immediately dangerous to life and health) value for antimony is 50 mg/m.

Actinium

Actinium is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Ac and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 89. Actinium gave the name to the <a href="actinide">actinide</a> series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and <a href="lawrencium">lawrencium</a> in the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. It is also sometimes considered the first of the 7th-period <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s, although lawrencium is less commonly given that position. Discovered in 1899, it was the first <a href="Primordial%20element">non-primordial radioactive element</a> to be isolated. <a href="Polonium">Polonium</a>, <a href="radium">radium</a> and <a href="radon">radon</a> were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902.

A soft, silvery-white <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a> metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s and many <a href="actinide">actinide</a>s, actinium assumes <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="thorium">thorium</a> ores as the <a href="isotope">isotope</a> Ac, which decays with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting <a href="beta%20particle">beta</a> and sometimes <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s, and Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One <a href="tonne">tonne</a> of natural <a href="uranium">uranium</a> in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a> makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of in a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a> targeting cancer cells in the body.

<a href="Andr%C3%A9-Louis%20Debierne">André-Louis Debierne</a>, a French chemist, announced the discovery of a new element in 1899. He separated it from <a href="uraninite">pitchblende</a> residues left by <a href="Marie%20Curie">Marie</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Curie">Pierre Curie</a> after they had extracted <a href="radium">radium</a>. In 1899, Debierne described the substance as similar to <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and (in 1900) as similar to <a href="thorium">thorium</a>. <a href="Friedrich%20Oskar%20Giesel">Friedrich Oskar Giesel</a> independently discovered actinium in 1902 as a substance being similar to <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a> and called it "emanium" in 1904. After a comparison of the substances half-lives determined by Debierne, <a href="Harriet%20Brooks">Harriet Brooks</a> in 1904, and <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Otto%20Sackur">Otto Sackur</a> in 1905, Debierne's chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority, despite the contradicting chemical properties he claimed for the element at different times.

Articles published in the 1970s and later suggest that Debierne's results published in 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. Furthermore, the now-known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence as anything other than a minor constituent of Debierne's 1899 and 1900 results; in fact, the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had, instead, accidentally identified <a href="protactinium">protactinium</a>, which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery. A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff. He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.

The name actinium originates from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "aktis, aktinos" (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. Its symbol Ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium, such as <a href="acetyl">acetyl</a>, <a href="acetate">acetate</a> and sometimes <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>.

Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a>, metallic element. Its estimated <a href="shear%20modulus">shear modulus</a> is similar to that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a> and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and <a href="ion%20chromatography">ion chromatography</a> are commonly used for the separation.

The first element of the <a href="actinide">actinide</a>s, actinium gave the group its name, much as <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a> had done for the <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it was not until 1928 that <a href="Charles%20Janet">Charles Janet</a> proposed the most significant change to <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a>'s <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> since the recognition of the lanthanides, by introducing the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by <a href="Glenn%20T.%20Seaborg">Glenn T. Seaborg</a>.

Actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of <a href="actinium%20oxide">actinium oxide</a> that impedes further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium exists in the <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> +3, and the Ac ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the [Rn]6d7s electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a> <a href="radon">radon</a>. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH); even this may in reality be an <a href="electride">electride</a> compound like its lighter congener LaH.

Only a limited number of actinium compounds are known including AcF, AcCl, AcBr, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, AcS, <a href="Actinium%20oxide">AcO</a> and AcPO. Except for AcPO, they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds. They all contain actinium in the oxidation state +3. In particular, the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent.

Here "a", "b" and "c" are lattice constants, No is space group number and "Z" is the number of <a href="formula%20unit">formula unit</a>s per <a href="unit%20cell">unit cell</a>. Density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters.

<a href="Actinium%20oxide">Actinium oxide</a> (AcO) can be obtained by heating the hydroxide at 500 °C or the <a href="oxalate">oxalate</a> at 1100 °C, in vacuum. Its crystal lattice is <a href="Isomorphism%20%28crystallography%29">isotypic</a> with the oxides of most trivalent rare-earth metals.

Actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a> to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700 °C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a> at 900–1000 °C yields <a href="oxyfluoride">oxyfluoride</a> AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800 °C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.

Actinium trichloride is obtained by reacting actinium hydroxide or <a href="oxalate">oxalate</a> with <a href="carbon%20tetrachloride">carbon tetrachloride</a> vapors at temperatures above 960 °C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium <a href="oxychloride">oxychloride</a> can be prepared by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a> at 1000 °C. However, in contrast to the oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> with <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>.

Reaction of <a href="aluminium%20bromide">aluminium bromide</a> and actinium oxide yields actinium tribromide:

and treating it with ammonium hydroxide at 500 °C results in the oxybromide AcOBr.

Actinium hydride was obtained by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300 °C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH hydride. The source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain.

Mixing <a href="monosodium%20phosphate">monosodium phosphate</a> (NaHPO) with a solution of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO·0.5HO), and heating actinium oxalate with <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> vapors at 1400 °C for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide AcS. It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> and <a href="carbon%20disulfide">carbon disulfide</a> on <a href="actinium%20oxide">actinium oxide</a> at 1000 °C.

Naturally occurring actinium is composed of two radioactive <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s; (from the radioactive family of ) and (a granddaughter of ). decays mainly as a <a href="beta%20decay">beta emitter</a> with a very small energy, but in 1.38% of cases it emits an <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>, so it can readily be identified through <a href="alpha%20spectrometry">alpha spectrometry</a>. Thirty-six <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s have been identified, the most stable being with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 21.772 years, with a half-life of 10.0 days and with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half-lives shorter than one minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which decays through <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> and <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a>. Actinium also has two known <a href="meta%20state">meta state</a>s. The most significant isotopes for chemistry are Ac, Ac, and Ac.

Purified comes into equilibrium with its decay products after about a half of year. It decays according to its 21.772-year half-life emitting mostly beta (98.62%) and some alpha particles (1.38%); the successive decay products are part of the <a href="actinium%20series">actinium series</a>. Owing to the low available amounts, low energy of its beta particles (maximum 44.8 keV) and low intensity of alpha radiation, is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products. The isotopes of actinium range in <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a> from 206 <a href="atomic%20mass%20unit">u</a> () to 236 u ().

Actinium is found only in traces in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> ores – one tonne of uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of Ac – and in <a href="thorium">thorium</a> ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of Ac per one tonne of thorium. The actinium <a href="isotope">isotope</a> Ac is a transient member of the <a href="Decay%20chain%23Actinium%20series">uranium-actinium series</a> <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a>, which begins with the parent isotope <a href="Uranium-235">U</a> (or <a href="Plutonium-239">Pu</a>) and ends with the stable lead isotope <a href="Isotopes%20of%20lead">Pb</a>. The isotope Ac is a transient member of the <a href="Decay%20chain%23Thorium%20series">thorium series</a> decay chain, which begins with the parent isotope <a href="Thorium-232">Th</a> and ends with the stable lead isotope <a href="Isotopes%20of%20lead">Pb</a>. Another actinium isotope (Ac) was transiently present in the <a href="Decay%20chain%23Neptunium%20series">neptunium series</a> <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a>, beginning with <a href="Neptunium">Np</a> (or <a href="Uranium-233">U</a>) and ending with <a href="thallium">thallium</a> (Tl) and near-stable <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a> (Bi), but this chain existed only in the early <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.

The low natural concentration, and the close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved. Instead, actinium is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of in a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>.
