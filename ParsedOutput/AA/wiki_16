Atlanta Falcons

The Atlanta Falcons are a professional <a href="American%20football">American football</a> team based in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. The Falcons compete in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) as a member club of the league's <a href="National%20Football%20Conference">National Football Conference</a> (NFC) <a href="NFC%20South">South</a> division. The Falcons joined the NFL in 1965 as an <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>, after the NFL offered then-owner <a href="Rankin%20Smith">Rankin Smith</a> a franchise to keep him from joining the rival <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> (AFL).

In their 51 years of existence, the Falcons have compiled a record of 350–450–6 (341–437–6 in the regular season and 9–13 in the playoffs), winning division championships in 1980, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2016. The Falcons have appeared in two <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>s, the first being during the 1998 season in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXIII">Super Bowl XXXIII</a>, where they lost to the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> 34–19, and the second being a 34–28 overtime defeat by the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LI">Super Bowl LI</a>.

The Falcons played their home games at the <a href="Georgia%20Dome">Georgia Dome</a> in <a href="downtown%20Atlanta">downtown Atlanta</a> from the 1992 to 2016 NFL seasons. Construction began on <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20Stadium">Mercedes-Benz Stadium</a> in May 2014, and play began there in the 2017 season. Their headquarters and practice facilities are located at a 50-acre site in <a href="Flowery%20Branch%2C%20Georgia">Flowery Branch, Georgia</a>.

Professional football first came to Atlanta in 1962, when the <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> staged two preseason contests, with one featuring the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> vs. the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Houston%20Oilers">Houston Oilers</a> and the second pitting the <a href="Dallas%20Texans%20%28AFL%29">Dallas Texans</a> against the <a href="Oakland%20Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>. Two years later, the <a href="American%20Football%20League">AFL</a> held another exhibition, this time with the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> taking on the <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>.

In 1965, after the <a href="Atlanta%E2%80%93Fulton%20County%20Stadium">Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium</a> (then known simply as Atlanta Stadium) was built, the city of Atlanta felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football. One independent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in Atlanta applied for franchises in both the <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> and the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>, acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights. Another group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the AFL.

With everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen worked out a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on June 7, 1965, contingent upon acquiring exclusive stadium rights from city officials. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL interest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival league's claim on the city of Atlanta. He forced the city to make a choice between the two leagues. By June 30, the city picked Rankin Smith and the NFL.

The Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965, when <a href="NFL%20Commissioner">NFL Commissioner</a> <a href="Pete%20Rozelle">Pete Rozelle</a> granted ownership to 41-year-old <a href="Rankin%20Smith%20Sr.">Rankin Smith Sr.</a> Smith, an Executive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia at the time, paid $8.5 million the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise. Former commissioner Pete Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion franchise became the 15th NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first pick in the <a href="1966%20NFL%20draft">1966 NFL draft</a> as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds. The Falcons drafted <a href="All-American">All-American</a> <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> <a href="Tommy%20Nobis">Tommy Nobis</a> from the <a href="Texas%20Longhorns%20football">University of Texas</a> with the first pick of the <a href="1966%20NFL%20draft">draft</a>, making him the first-ever Falcon. The <a href="National%20Football%20League">league</a> also held the <a href="1966%20NFL%20Expansion%20Draft">1966 NFL Expansion Draft</a> six weeks later in which the Falcons selected unprotected players from existing franchises. Although the Falcons selected many good players in those drafts, they still were not able to win right away.

The Atlanta Falcons Football Club received its nickname on August 29, 1965. Miss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from <a href="Griffin%2C%20Georgia">Griffin, Georgia</a>, was singled out from many people who suggested "Falcons" as the nickname for the new franchise. Elliott wrote: "the Falcon is proud and dignified, with great courage and fight. It never drops its prey. It is deadly and has a great sporting tradition."

The Falcons had their first season in , and their first preseason game on August 1, 1966, losing to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. Under head coach <a href="Norb%20Hecker">Norb Hecker</a> they lost their first nine regular-season games in 1966 and secured their first victory on the road against the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a>. The team finished the 1960s with only 12 wins. The Falcons had their first <a href="Monday%20Night%20Football">Monday Night Football</a> game in Atlanta during the season, losing 20–7 to the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>. The only two winning seasons in this twelve-year period were 1971 and 1973.

In the 1978 season, the Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the Eagles 14–13. The following week, they lost to the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> 27–20 in the Divisional Playoffs.

In the 1980 season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12–4 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30–27 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the <a href="Minnesota%20Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a>, 30–24. Falcons coach <a href="Leeman%20Bennett">Leeman Bennett</a> was fired after the loss. The team would then have losing seasons for the next eight years.

In 1989, the Falcons drafted cornerback <a href="Deion%20Sanders">Deion Sanders</a> in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. "Neon Deion" (a.k.a. "Prime Time") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams (<a href="the%20New%20York%20Yankees">the New York Yankees</a> and the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.

After defeating the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' 1991 season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>. In 1991, the Falcons drafted <a href="Brett%20Favre">Brett Favre</a> as the thirty-third overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of 4 passing attempts with 0 receptions and 2 interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>.

In 1992, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least during its time there.

In 1998, under recently acquired head coach <a href="Dan%20Reeves">Dan Reeves</a>, quarterback <a href="Chris%20Chandler">Chris Chandler</a> and running back <a href="Jamal%20Anderson">Jamal Anderson</a> the "Dirty Bird" Falcons had their greatest season to date. On November 8, they beat the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> 41–10, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14–2 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the <a href="Hubert%20H.%20Humphrey%20Metrodome">Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a> in the <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a> 30–27, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34–19 to the defending champion <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a> in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXIII">Super Bowl XXXIII</a>.

In the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back <a href="Jamal%20Anderson">Jamal Anderson</a>, who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5–11 regular season record. In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4–12 and once again missing the playoffs.

In the <a href="2001%20NFL%20draft">2001 NFL draft</a>, the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the <a href="San%20Diego%20Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>, acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a>) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist <a href="Tim%20Dwight">Tim Dwight</a> and the fifth overall pick (used on running back <a href="LaDainian%20Tomlinson">LaDainian Tomlinson</a>).

The Falcons finished the <a href="2001%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">2001 season</a> with a record of 7–9 and missed the playoffs. <a href="Jessie%20Tuggle">Jessie Tuggle</a> retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta. On December 6, 2001, <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Blank">Arthur M. Blank</a> reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team. In a special meeting prior to <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXVI">Super Bowl XXXVI</a> in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the purchase.

The 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular season record of 9–6–1, tying the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. It was Vick's first year as the starter, and the team, with newly acquired running back Warrick Dunn, delivered the Green Bay Packers their first home playoff loss ever. A 20-6 loss to the <a href="Donovan%20McNabb">Donovan McNabb</a>-led Philadelphia Eagles the following week, however, ended the Falcons' season.

On March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo. During the 2003 preseason Vick broke his leg and missed the first twelve games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to release head coach Dan Reeves. <a href="Wade%20Phillips">Wade Phillips</a> acted as interim coach for the final 3 games. Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5–11 record that year. In 2004, a new head coach, <a href="Jim%20L.%20Mora">Jim L. Mora</a>, was hired and Vick returned for the <a href="2004%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">full season</a>. The Falcons went 11–5, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the <a href="2004%20St.%20Louis%20Rams%20season">St. Louis Rams</a>, 47–17, in the <a href="Georgia%20Dome">Georgia Dome</a>, advancing to the <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a>, which they lost to the <a href="2004%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season">Eagles</a>, 27–10.

The <a href="2005%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">Falcons</a> again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in , going 8–8. In , Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7–9, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and <a href="Bobby%20Petrino">Bobby Petrino</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a>'s football coach, replaced him. Before the <a href="2007%20NFL%20season">2007</a> season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia. On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.

For the 2007 season, the <a href="2007%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">Falcons</a> were forced to start <a href="Joey%20Harrington">Joey Harrington</a> at quarterback. On December 11, 13 games into his first NFL season as head coach, <a href="Bobby%20Petrino">Bobby Petrino</a> resigned without notice to coach at the <a href="Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football">University of Arkansas</a>, leaving the beleaguered players only a note in the locker room. Secondary Coach <a href="Emmitt%20Thomas">Emmitt Thomas</a> was named interim coach for the final three games of the season on December 12. The Falcons ended the year with a dismal 4–12 record.

After the tumultuous and disappointing 2007 season, the Falcons made a number of moves, hiring a new General Manager and head coach, drafting a new starting quarterback, and signing a starting running back.

On January 13, 2008, the Falcons named former Patriots director of college football scouting <a href="Thomas%20Dimitroff">Thomas Dimitroff</a> General Manager. On January 23, <a href="Jacksonville%20Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> defensive coach and former linebackers coach for the 2000 Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens <a href="Mike%20Smith%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Mike Smith</a> was named the Falcons' new head coach. Chargers back-up RB <a href="Michael%20Turner%20%28American%20football%29">Michael Turner</a> agreed to a 6-year deal, $30 million deal on March 2. On April 26, <a href="Matt%20Ryan%20%28American%20football%29">Matt Ryan</a> (quarterback from <a href="Boston%20College">Boston College</a>) was drafted third overall in the <a href="2008%20NFL%20draft">2008 NFL draft</a> by the Falcons.

The Falcons finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 11–5, and the #5 seed in the playoffs. On December 21, 2008, Atlanta beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–17 to clinch a wild card spot, earning a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The Falcons would go on to lose in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs to the eventual NFC champion <a href="2008%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season">Arizona Cardinals</a>, 30–24.

Matt Ryan started all 16 games in his rookie season and was named the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year. First-year head coach Mike Smith was named 2008 NFL Coach of the Year.

Although they failed to make the playoffs in 2009 the team rallied to win their final three regular season games to record back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. The Falcons defeated the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> 20–10 in the final game of the season to improve their record to 9–7.

In 2010, with a regular season record of 13–3, the Falcons secured a third straight winning season, their fourth overall divisional title, and the top overall seed in the NFC playoffs; however, the Falcons were overpowered by the eventual <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLV">Super Bowl XLV</a> champion <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> in the NFC Divisional Playoffs 48–21. The Falcons scored 414 points – the fifth-most in franchise history. The team sent an NFL-high and franchise-best nine players to the <a href="2011%20Pro%20Bowl">2011 Pro Bowl</a>.

The Falcons made a surprise trade up with the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> in the <a href="2011%20NFL%20draft">2011 NFL draft</a> to select <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football">Alabama</a> wide receiver <a href="Julio%20Jones">Julio Jones</a> sixth overall. In exchange, the Falcons gave up their first-, second- and fourth-round draft picks in 2011, and their first and fourth draft picks in 2012. Jones, along with teammates <a href="Tony%20Gonzalez">Tony Gonzalez</a> and <a href="Roddy%20White">Roddy White</a>, have since been dubbed Atlanta's "Big Three" (based on their total number of reception yards). On August 30, 2011, <a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> senior writer <a href="Peter%20King%20%28sportswriter%29">Peter King</a>, who correctly predicted the 2011 Super Bowl, made his predictions for the 2011 season and picked the Falcons to defeat the San Diego Chargers in the 2012 Super Bowl. The Falcons finished the season at 10–6, securing the fifth seed after a Week 17 beatdown of Tampa Bay in which the Falcons pulled their starters after leading 42–0 just 23 minutes into the game.

The Falcons then went on to play the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> in a 2011 NFC Wild Card Game at <a href="MetLife%20Stadium">MetLife Stadium</a> in <a href="East%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey">East Rutherford, New Jersey</a>. The first half was a defensive struggle, with the first points coming off of a safety by the Falcons, giving Atlanta a 2–0 lead. In the 2nd quarter, though, <a href="Eli%20Manning">Eli Manning</a> connected with <a href="Hakeem%20Nicks">Hakeem Nicks</a> for a short touchdown pass to make it 7–2 Giants heading into the 2nd half. Then the Giants took control, as Manning threw for two more TD passes to <a href="Mario%20Manningham">Mario Manningham</a> and Nicks and the defense completed its shutout of the Falcons to give the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> the win, 24–2, and the Falcons their third straight playoff loss with <a href="Matt%20Ryan%20%28American%20football%29">Matt Ryan</a> and <a href="Mike%20Smith%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Mike Smith</a>. After the season Defense Coordinator <a href="Brian%20VanGorder">Brian VanGorder</a> accepted a coaching job at <a href="Auburn%20University">Auburn University</a>, and the offensive coordinator <a href="Mike%20Mularkey">Mike Mularkey</a> took the head coaching job in Jacksonville.

Atlanta exploded out of the gate, going a franchise best 8–0 and remaining the last unbeaten team in the NFL that year. Their hopes to get an undefeated season came to an end with a 27–31 loss to the division rival Saints. Julio Jones had a remarkable second year, grabbing 10 touchdowns and 1,198 yards. The Falcons finished the season 13–3, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC playoffs.

The Falcons played the <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> in their first playoff game. Although they went down 28–27 with only 31 seconds left on the clock, <a href="Matt%20Ryan%20%28American%20football%29">Matt Ryan</a> led the team to their first playoff victory, 30–28. It was the only playoff victory in the Mike Smith era.

The Atlanta Falcons then advanced to face the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>. The Falcons seized control of the game early with a <a href="Matt%20Bryant">Matt Bryant</a> field goal, a trio of Matt Ryan touchdown passes caught by <a href="Julio%20Jones">Julio Jones</a> and <a href="Tony%20Gonzalez">Tony Gonzalez</a> coupled with outstanding defensive play. By the end of the half, the score was 24–14. The tides of the game began to shift in the second half as the 49ers rallied back with a pair of <a href="Frank%20Gore">Frank Gore</a> touchdown runs. Atlanta's offense attempted to reply but were ultimately shut down by the 49er defense. A few series later, late in the 4th quarter with little time remaining, Atlanta found themselves in a 4th and 4 situation at the 10-yard line. The Falcons needed just 10 more yards to secure victory and advance to their first Super Bowl berth in 14 years. Matt Ryan fired a pass to <a href="Roddy%20White">Roddy White</a> which was ultimately broken up by inside linebacker <a href="NaVorro%20Bowman">NaVorro Bowman</a>, resulting in a 28–24 defeat.

Following the success of the previous season, the Falcons were an expected Super Bowl contender. However, injuries hampered the team's performance and the team finished the season 4–12. With that, the streak of consecutive winning seasons came to an end and <a href="Mike%20Smith%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Mike Smith</a> had his first losing season as a head coach. <a href="Tony%20Gonzalez">Tony Gonzalez</a>, in his final season in the NFL, was selected to the <a href="2014%20Pro%20Bowl">2014 Pro Bowl</a> as a starter representing Team Rice. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, director of player personnel <a href="Les%20Snead">Les Snead</a> departed the team to join the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">St. Louis Rams</a> and <a href="Dave%20Caldwell">Dave Caldwell</a>, assistant to general manager <a href="Thomas%20Dimitroff">Thomas Dimitroff</a>, left the team to join the <a href="Jacksonville%20Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. Scott Pioli, former GM of the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, was announced as the Falcons' new assistant GM. Mike Smith was given a one-year extension on his contract as head coach. The Falcons had the 6th overall pick in the <a href="2014%20NFL%20draft">2014 NFL draft</a> with which they selected <a href="Jake%20Matthews">Jake Matthews</a>, who played as offensive tackle for <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM">Texas A&M</a>.

Despite having another rough season, the Falcons still had an opportunity to qualify for the playoffs at the end of the regular season. The Falcons hosted the <a href="Carolina%20Panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> in their regular season finale, with the winners clinching the <a href="NFC%20South">NFC South</a> division. Unfortunately, the Falcons lost in a 34–3 blowout as <a href="Matt%20Ryan%20%28American%20football%29">Matt Ryan</a> threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns and got sacked six times. The Falcons finished the season 6–10, marking the second consecutive losing season for the team. The following day, <a href="Mike%20Smith%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Mike Smith</a> was fired after seven seasons as head coach. The Falcons would soon hire <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> defensive coordinator <a href="Dan%20Quinn%20%28American%20football%29">Dan Quinn</a> as the team's 16th head coach. The Falcons had the 8th overall pick in the <a href="2015%20NFL%20draft">2015 NFL draft</a> with which they selected <a href="Vic%20Beasley">Vic Beasley</a>, a defensive end from Clemson University.

In February 2015, the team was investigated by the NFL for alleged use of artificial crowd noise in the Georgia Dome. The Falcons lost a <a href="2016%20NFL%20Draft">2016 NFL Draft</a> selection as a result of the league's investigation.

Dan Quinn's first season saw a 5–0 start, the team's best start in four years. They would then struggle throughout the rest of the season by losing 8 of their last 11 games, resulting in an 8–8 record. They did, however, give the Panthers their only regular season loss. The Falcons used their first-round pick in the <a href="2016%20NFL%20Draft">2016 NFL Draft</a> on safety <a href="Keanu%20Neal">Keanu Neal</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a>.

In the Falcons' 25th and final season in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta lost their Week 1 game to the Buccaneers 24–31. The Falcons would then win their next four including one over the Panthers, when the franchise set new records. Matt Ryan threw for 503 yards, and Julio Jones caught twelve passes for 300 yards. With a 41–13 thrashing of the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> in Week 15, the Falcons improved to 9–5 and secured their first winning season since 2012. One week later, the Falcons defeated the Panthers in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a> and clinched their first NFC South division title since 2012. In their last regular season game at the Georgia Dome, the Falcons defeated the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>, and secured an 11–5 record and a first round bye.

In the divisional round of the playoffs, Atlanta defeated the Seahawks 36–20 in the Georgia Dome, and hosted their last game at the Dome against the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> in the <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a> on January 22, 2017. The Falcons defeated the Packers 44–21 to advance to <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LI">Super Bowl LI</a> as the NFC champions. Atlanta was up 28–3 late in the third quarter, and the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> scored 31 unanswered points, with the last 6 in the first-ever overtime in the Super Bowl. The Patriots' 25-point comeback was the largest in Super Bowl history.

In 2016, the Falcons scored 540 points in the regular season, the seventh-most in NFL history, tied with the <a href="Greatest%20Show%20on%20Turf">Greatest Show on Turf</a> (the <a href="2000%20St.%20Louis%20Rams%20season">2000 St. Louis Rams</a>). However, the Falcons defense gave up 406 points, 27th in the league.

The Falcons moved into their new home, the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20Stadium">Mercedes-Benz Stadium</a>, this season. Their first game ever played at the new stadium was a preseason loss to the <a href="Arizona%20Cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>. The first regular season game at the new stadium was a rematch of the 2016–17 NFC Championship, with Atlanta defeating Green Bay 34–23.

The Falcons have called only two stadiums home in their 51 years of existence, and will have a third home in their history in the late summer of 2017. The first was the <a href="Atlanta%E2%80%93Fulton%20County%20Stadium">Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium</a>, sharing with the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> team until 1991. In 1992, the <a href="Georgia%20Dome">Georgia Dome</a> was built, and the Falcons played there from its opening to the 2016 season. The Dome has been frequently used for <a href="college%20football">college football</a>, including <a href="Georgia%20State%20Panthers%20football">Georgia State</a> football and college bowl games such as the <a href="Peach%20Bowl">Peach Bowl</a>.

In an effort to replace the aging Georgia Dome and potentially host a future <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>, team owner Arthur Blank proposed a deal with the city of Atlanta to build a new state-of-the-art stadium not far from where the Georgia Dome is located. Blank will contribute $800 million and the city of Atlanta will contribute an additional $200 million via bonds backed by the city's hotel/motel tax towards the construction of a retractable roof stadium. Blank will contribute additional money for cost overruns if it is needed. The team will provide up to $50 million towards infrastructure costs that weren't included in the construction budget and to retire the remaining debt on the Georgia Dome. In addition, Blank's foundation and the city will each provide $15 million for development in surrounding neighborhoods. Though the total cost of the stadium was initially estimated to be around $1 billion, the total cost was revised to $1.5 billion according to Blank. In March 2013, the Atlanta City Council voted 11–4 in favor of building the stadium. The retractable roof <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20Stadium">Mercedes-Benz Stadium</a> broke ground in May 2014, and will begin hosting the Falcons' and <a href="Atlanta%20United%20FC">Atlanta United</a>'s <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> games in 2017.

The Atlanta Falcons' colors are red, black, silver and white. When the team debuted in <a href="1966%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">1966</a>, the Falcons wore red helmets with a black falcon crest logo. In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets">Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</a> (White and Gold) and the <a href="Georgia%20Bulldogs">Georgia Bulldogs</a> (Red and Black). Although the gold was later taken out, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978.

A prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the <a href="1974%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">1974 season</a> but was never worn.

In <a href="1990%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">1990</a>, the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in <a href="1997%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">1997</a>. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)

Both the logo and uniforms changed in <a href="2003%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">2003</a>. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter "F".

Although the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.

In <a href="2004%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season">2004</a>, the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a>, winning the first two contests (24–21 in and 36–17 in ), but losing 31–13 in . The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34–14. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14–3. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time).

In the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 – against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well.

In every season except for their debut season, the Falcons have shared a division with the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South). Over this time, a heated rivalry has developed between the two cities' franchises. Atlanta leads the series 51–45.

In addition, the Falcons share a similar, yet smaller, rivalry with the <a href="Carolina%20Panthers">Carolina Panthers</a>, with both teams having been in the <a href="NFC%20West">NFC West</a> from the Panthers' founding in 1995 to the NFL realignment in 2002, where they have been in the <a href="NFC%20South">NFC South</a> since then. The Falcons lead the series 27–17.

Sanders and Humphrey are the only two players in the Hall of Fame that have been inducted based substantially on their service with the Falcons. Andersen spent eight of his 25 NFL seasons with the Falcons, and remains the team's all-time scoring leader, but he also played his first 13 NFL seasons with the New Orleans Saints, also leading that team's career scoring list.

The Atlanta Falcons organization does not officially retire jersey numbers, but considers certain players' jerseys worthy of being honored. The Falcons Ring of Honor, which is featured in the rafters of the Georgia Dome, honors individual players.

In their history, the Atlanta Falcons have had 15 head coaches.
Falcons' flagship radio station is <a href="WZGC%20%28FM%29">WZGC</a> 92.9 The Game. <a href="Wes%20Durham">Wes Durham</a>, son of longtime <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels">North Carolina Tar Heels</a> voice <a href="Woody%20Durham">Woody Durham</a>, is the Falcons' play-by-play announcer, with former Atlanta Falcons QB and pro football veteran, <a href="David%20Archer%20%28quarterback%29">Dave Archer</a> serving as color commentator.

In 2014, <a href="The%20CW">The CW</a> owned-and-operated station <a href="WUPA">WUPA</a> became the official television station of the Falcons, gaining rights to its preseason games, which are produced by <a href="CBS%20Sports">CBS Sports</a>.

Heathenry in the United States

<a href="Heathenry%20%28new%20religious%20movement%29">Heathenry</a> is a <a href="Modern%20Paganism">modern Pagan</a> <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a> that has been active in the United States since at least the early 1970s. Although the term "Heathenry" is often employed to cover the entire religious movement, different Heathen groups within the United States often prefer the term "Ásatrú" or "Odinism" as self-designations.

Heathenry appeared in the United States during the 1960s, at the same time as the wider emergence of <a href="Neopaganism%20in%20the%20United%20States">modern Paganism in the United States</a>. Among the earliest American group was the Odinist Fellowship, founded by Danish migrant <a href="Else%20Christensen">Else Christensen</a> in 1969.

Ásatrú grew steadily in the United States during the 1960s. In 1969, the Danish Odinist <a href="Else%20Christensen">Else Christensen</a> established the <a href="Odinist%20Fellowship">Odinist Fellowship</a> from her home in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, U.S.A. Heavily influenced by <a href="Alexander%20Rud%20Mills">Alexander Rud Mills</a>' writings, she began publication of a magazine, "The Odinist", although this focused to a greater extent on right-wing and racialist ideas than theological ones. <a href="Stephen%20McNallen">Stephen McNallen</a> first founded the Viking Brotherhood in the early 1970s, before creating the <a href="%C3%81satr%C3%BA%20Free%20Assembly">Ásatrú Free Assembly</a> (AFA) in 1976, which broke up in 1986 amid widespread political disagreements after McNallen's repudiation of <a href="neo-Nazis">neo-Nazis</a> within the group. In the 1990s, McNallen founded the <a href="%C3%81satr%C3%BA%20Folk%20Assembly">Ásatrú Folk Assembly</a> (AFA), an ethnically oriented Heathen group headquartered in California.

Meanwhile, <a href="Valgard%20Murray">Valgard Murray</a> and his kindred in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> founded the <a href="%C3%81satr%C3%BA%20Alliance">Ásatrú Alliance</a> (AA) in the late 1980s, which shared the AFA's perspectives on race and which published the "Vor Tru" newsletter. In 1987, <a href="Edred%20Thorsson">Edred Thorsson</a> and James Chisholm founded <a href="The%20Troth">The Troth</a>, which was incorporated in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Taking an inclusive, non-racialist view, it soon grew into an international organisation.

In English usage, the genitive "" "of Æsir faith" is often used on its own to denote adherents (both singular and plural). This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the deities of Scandinavia, although it is problematic as many Asatruar worship deities and entities other than the Æsir, such as the Vanir, Valkyries, Elves, and Dwarves. Other practitioners term their religion "Vanatrú", meaning "those who honour the Vanir" or "Dísitrú", meaning "those who honour the Goddesses", depending on their particular theological emphasis.

Within the community it is sometimes stated that the term "Ásatrú" pertains to groups which are not racially focused, while "Odinism" is the term preferred by racially oriented groups. However, in practice, there is no such neat division in terminology.

There are notable differences of emphasis between "Ásatrú" as practiced in the US and in Scandinavia. According to Strmiska and Sigurvinsson (2005), American Asatruar tend to prefer a more devotional form of worship and a more emotional conception of the Nordic gods than Scandinavian practitioners, reflecting the parallel tendency of highly emotional forms of Christianity prevalent in the United States.

Although deeming it impossible to calculate the exact size of the Heathen community in the US, sociologist Jeffrey Kaplan estimated that, in the mid-1990s, there were around 500 active practitioners in the country, with a further thousand individuals on the periphery of the movement. He noted that the overwhelming majority of individuals in the movement were white, male, and young. Most had at least an undergraduate degree, and worked in a mix of <a href="White-collar%20worker">white collar</a> and <a href="Blue-collar%20worker">blue collar jobs</a>. From her experience within the community, Snook concurred that the majority of American Heathens were male, adding also that most were also white and middle-aged, but believed that there had been a growth in the proportion of Heathen women in the US since the mid-1990s.

The Pagan Census project led by <a href="Helen%20A.%20Berger">Helen A. Berger</a>, Evan A. Leach, and Leigh S. Shaffer gained 60 responses from Heathens in the US, noting that 65% were male and 35% female, which they saw as the "opposite" of the rest of the country's Pagan community. The majority had a college education, but were generally less well educated than the wider Pagan community, with a lower median income than the wider Pagan community too. 
Subsequent assessments have suggested a larger support base; 10,000 to 20,000 according to McNallen, and 7,878 according to the 2014 census.

Ásatrú organizations have memberships which span the entire political and spiritual spectrum. There is a history of political controversy within organized US Ásatrú, mostly surrounding the question of how to deal with such adherents as place themselves in a context of the <a href="far%20right">far right</a> and <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a>, notably resulting in the fragmentation of the "Asatru Free Assembly" in 1986.

Externally, political activity on the part of Ásatrú organizations has surrounded campaigns against alleged <a href="Religious%20discrimination%20against%20Neopagans">religious discrimination</a>, such as the call for the introduction of an Ásatrú "emblem of belief" by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs">United States Department of Veterans Affairs</a> to parallel the Wiccan pentacle granted to the widow of <a href="Patrick%20Stewart%20%28soldier%29">Patrick Stewart</a> in 2006. In May 2013, the "<a href="Mj%C3%B6lnir">Hammer of Thor</a>" was added to the list of <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs%20emblems%20for%20headstones%20and%20markers">United States Department of Veterans Affairs emblems for headstones and markers</a>.

Historically, the main dispute between the national organizations has generally centered on the interpretation of "Nordic heritage" as either something cultural, or as something genetic or racial. In the internal discourse within American Ásatrú, this cultural/racial divide has long been known as "universalist" vs. "folkish" Ásatrú. 
<a href="The%20Troth">The Troth</a> takes the "universalist" position, claiming "Ásatrú" as a synonym for "Northern European Heathenry" taken to comprise "many variations, names, and practices, including <a href="Theodism">Theodism</a>, Irminism, Odinism, and Anglo-Saxon Heathenry". The <a href="Asatru%20Folk%20Assembly">Asatru Folk Assembly</a> takes the folkish position, claiming that Ásatrú and the Germanic beliefs are ancestral in nature, and as an indigenous religion of the European Folk should only be accessed by the descendants of Europe. In the <a href="Neopaganism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK</a>, Germanic Neopaganism is more commonly known as <a href="Odinism">Odinism</a> or as "Heathenry". This is mostly a matter of terminology, and US Ásatrú may be equated with UK Odinism for practical purposes, as is evident in the short-lived <a href="International%20Asatru-Odinic%20Alliance">International Asatru-Odinic Alliance</a> of folkish Ásatrú/Odinist groups.

Some groups identifying as Ásatrú have been associated with <a href="national%20socialist">national socialist</a> and <a href="white%20nationalist">white nationalist</a> movements. <a href="Wotansvolk">Wotansvolk</a> for example is an explicitly racial form.

More recently, however, many Ásatrú groups have been taking a harder stance against these elements of their community. <a href="http%3A//declaration127.com/">Declaration 127</a>, so named for the corresponding stanza of the <a href="H%C3%A1vam%C3%A1l">Hávamál</a>: "When you see misdeeds, speak out against them, and give your enemies no frið” is a collective statement denouncing and testifying disassociation with the <a href="Asatru%20Folk%20Assembly">Asatru Folk Assembly</a> for alleged racial and sexually-discriminatory practices and beliefs signed by over 150 Ásatrú religious organizations from over 15 different nations mainly represented on <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>.

Inmates of the "Intensive Management Unit" at <a href="Washington%20State%20Penitentiary">Washington State Penitentiary</a> who are adherents of Ásatrú in 2001 were deprived of their <a href="Mj%C3%B6lnir">Thor's Hammer</a> medallions.
In 2007, a federal judge confirmed that Ásatrú adherents in US prisons have the right to possess a Thor’s Hammer pendant. An inmate sued the Virginia Department of Corrections after he was denied it while members of other religions were allowed their medallions.

In the Georgacarakos v. Watts case Peter N. Georgacarakos filed a pro se civil-rights complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against 19 prison officials for "interference with the free exercise of his Ásatrú religion" and "discrimination on the basis of his being Ásatrú".

Ansible

An ansible is a category of <a href="Fiction">fictional</a> device or technology capable of <a href="instantaneous">instantaneous</a> or <a href="faster-than-light%20communication">faster-than-light communication</a>. It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay. The term ansible is broadly shared across works of several science fiction authors, settings and continuities.

<a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> <a href="neologism">coined</a> the word "ansible" in her 1966 novel "<a href="Rocannon%27s%20World">Rocannon's World</a>". The word is a contraction of "answerable", as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over <a href="interstellar%20communication">interstellar</a> distances. Her award-winning 1974 novel "<a href="The%20Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>", a book in the <a href="Hainish%20Cycle">Hainish Cycle</a>, tells of the invention of the ansible.

Le Guin's ansible was said to communicate "instantaneously", but other authors have adopted the name for devices capable only of finite-speed communication, although still faster than light.

The name of the device has since been borrowed by authors such as <a href="Orson%20Scott%20Card">Orson Scott Card</a>,
<a href="Vernor%20Vinge">Vernor Vinge</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Moon">Elizabeth Moon</a>, <a href="Jason%20Jones%20%28programmer%29">Jason Jones</a>, <a href="Kim%20Stanley%20Robinson">Kim Stanley Robinson</a>, <a href="L.A.%20Graf">L.A. Graf</a>, and <a href="Dan%20Simmons">Dan Simmons</a>.

In "<a href="The%20Word%20for%20World%20Is%20Forest">The Word for World Is Forest</a>", Le Guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles, at least one "must be on a large-mass body, the other can be anywhere in the cosmos."

In "<a href="The%20Left%20Hand%20of%20Darkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a>", the ansible 

Any ansible may be used to communicate through any other, by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible. They have a limited <a href="bandwidth%20%28computing%29">bandwidth</a> which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session, and are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform <a href="text%20messaging">text messaging</a>.

<a href="Orson%20Scott%20Card">Orson Scott Card</a>'s <a href="Ender%27s%20Game%20series">"Ender's Game" series</a> uses the term "ansible" for his own fictitious communicator, one of the characters explaining that "...somebody dredged the name "ansible" out of an old book somewhere." Card's description of the ansible's functions in "<a href="Xenocide">Xenocide</a>" involves a fictional subatomic particle, the philote. In the "Enderverse", the two <a href="quark">quark</a>s inside a <a href="pion">pi meson</a> can be separated by an arbitrary distance while remaining connected by "philotic rays". This concept is similar to <a href="quantum%20teleportation">quantum teleportation</a> due to <a href="quantum%20entanglement">entanglement</a>. However, in reality, <a href="quark%20confinement">quark confinement</a> prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance.

Adalbert of Prague

Adalbert of Prague (; 956 23 April 997), known in Czech by his birth name Vojtěch (), was a Bohemian missionary and <a href="Chalcedonian%20Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="saint">saint</a>. He was the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Prague">Bishop of Prague</a> and a <a href="missionary">missionary</a> to the Hungarians, Poles, and Prussians, who was martyred in his efforts to convert the <a href="Baltic%20peoples">Baltic</a> <a href="Old%20Prussians">Prussians</a> to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. He was said to be the composer of "<a href="Bogurodzica">Bogurodzica</a>", the oldest known Polish hymn, but this is now thought unlikely, as he did not know the language. St. Adalbert (or St. Vojtěch; , ) was later declared the <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and the former polity of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>.

Born as "Vojtěch" in 952 or ca. 956 in <a href="Libice%20nad%20Cidlinou">Libice</a>, he belonged to the <a href="Slavn%C3%ADk%20dynasty">Slavnik clan</a>, one of the two most powerful families in Bohemia. Bohemian priest <a href="Cosmas%20of%20Prague">Cosmas of Prague</a> (1045–1125) recorded events from his life. His father was <a href="Slavn%C3%ADk">Slavník</a> (d. 978–981), a duke ruling a province centred at Libice. His mother was <a href="St%C5%99ezislava">Střezislava</a> (d. 985–987), according to some belonging to the <a href="P%C5%99emyslid%20dynasty">Přemyslid dynasty</a>. He had five brothers: <a href="Sob%C4%9Bslav%20%28d.%201004%29">Soběslav</a>, Spytimír, Dobroslav, Pořej, and Čáslav. Cosmas also refers to Radim (later <a href="Radim%20Gaudentius">Gaudentius</a>) as a brother; he is believed to have been a half-brother of his father's liaison with another woman, or a near friend. Having survived a grave illness in childhood, his parents decided to dedicate him to the service of God. Adalbert was well educated, having studied for approximately ten years (970-80) in <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a> under the tutelage of <a href="Adalbert%20of%20Magdeburg">St. Adalbert of Magdeburg</a>. The young Vojtěch took his tutor's name "Adalbert" at his <a href="Confirmation">Confirmation</a>.

In 981 <a href="Adalbert%20of%20Magdeburg">St. Adalbert of Magdeburg</a> died, and his young protege Adalbert returned to <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>. Later Bishop <a href="D%C4%9Btmar">Dietmar of Prague</a> ordained him a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="priest">priest</a>. In 982, Bishop Dietmar died, and Adalbert, despite being under canonical age, was chosen to succeed him as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Prague">Bishop of Prague</a>. Amiable and somewhat worldly, he was not expected to trouble the secular powers by making excessive claims for the Church. Although Adalbert was from a wealthy family, he avoided comfort and luxury, and was noted for his charity and austerity. After six years of prayer and preaching, he had made little headway in evangelizing the Bohemians, who maintained deeply embedded pagan beliefs.

Adalbert opposed the participation of Christians in the <a href="slavery">slave</a> trade and complained of <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a> and idolatry, which were common among the people. Once he started to propose reforms he was met with opposition from both the secular powers and the clergy. His family refused to support Duke <a href="Boleslaus%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bohemia">Boleslaus</a> in an unsuccessful war against Poland. Adalbert was no longer welcome and eventually forced into exile. In 990 he went to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. He lived as a hermit at the Benedictine <a href="Santi%20Bonifacio%20e%20Alessio">monastery of Saint Alexis</a>. Five years later, Boleslaus requested that the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> send Adalbert back to Prague, in hopes of securing his family's support. <a href="Pope%20John%20XV">Pope John XV</a> agreed, with the understanding that Adalbert was free to leave Prague if he continued to encounter entrenched resistance. Adalbert returned as bishop of Prague, where he was initially received with demonstrations of apparent joy. and founded a <a href="Brevnov%20Monastery">monastery in Břevnov</a> near the City, it being the first monastery in the Czech territory.

In 995, the <a href="Slavniks">Slavniks</a>' former rivalry with the Přemyslids, who were allied with the powerful Bohemian clan of the <a href="Vr%C5%A1ovci">Vršovci</a>s, resulted in the storming of the Slavnik town of <a href="Libice%20nad%20Cidlinou">Libice nad Cidlinou</a>, led by the Přemyslid <a href="Boleslaus%20II%20the%20Pious">Boleslaus II the Pious</a>. During the struggle four or five of Adalbert's brothers were killed. The Zličan principality became part of the Přemyslids' estate. Adalbert unsuccessfully attempted to protect a noblewoman caught in adultery. She had fled to a convent, where she was killed. In upholding the right of sanctuary, Bishop Adalbert responded by excommunicating the murderers. Butler suggests that the incident was orchestrated by enemies of his family.

After this, Adalbert could not safely stay in Bohemia and escaped from Prague. Strachkvas was eventually appointed to be his successor. However, Strachkvas suddenly died during the liturgy at which he was to accede to his episcopal office in Prague. The cause of his death are still ambiguous. The Pope directed Adalbert to resume his see, but believing that he would not be allowed back, he requested a brief as an itinerant missionary.

Adalbert then traveled to <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and probably baptized <a href="G%C3%A9za%2C%20Grand%20Prince%20of%20the%20Hungarians">Géza of Hungary</a> and his son <a href="Stephen%20of%20Hungary">Stephen</a> in <a href="Esztergom">Esztergom</a>. Then he went to <a href="Poland">Poland</a> where he was cordially welcomed by <a href="Boleslaus%20I%20of%20Poland">then-Duke Boleslaus I</a> and installed as Bishop of <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a>.

Adalbert again relinquished his diocese, namely that of <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a>, and set out as a missionary to preach to the inhabitants near <a href="Prussia%20%28Baltic%29">Prussia</a>. <a href="Boleslaus%20I%20of%20Poland">Bolesław I</a>, Duke (and, later, King) of Poland, sent <a href="soldiers">soldiers</a> with Adalbert on his mission to the Prussians. The Bishop and his companions, including his half-brother Radim (Gaudentius), entered Prussian territory and traveled along the coast of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> to <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>.

Success attended his efforts at first, but his imperious manner in commanding the people to abandon paganism irritated them, and at the instigation of one of the pagan priests he was murdered on 23 April 997 on the Baltic Sea coast east of <a href="Truso">Truso</a> (currently the city of <a href="Elbl%C4%85g">Elbląg</a>) or near Tenkitten and <a href="Fischhausen">Fischhausen</a>. It is recorded that his body was bought back for its weight in <a href="gold">gold</a> by King <a href="Boleslaus%20I%20of%20Poland">Boleslaus I of Poland</a>.

A few years after his martyrdom, Adalbert was <a href="canonization">canonized</a> as St. Adalbert of Prague. His life was written in "Vita Sancti Adalberti Pragensis" by various authors, the earliest being traced to imperial <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a> and the Bishop of <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20%28city%29">Liège</a>, <a href="Notger%20von%20L%C3%BCttich">Notger von Lüttich</a>, although it was previously assumed that the <a href="Rome">Roman</a> monk <a href="John%20Canaparius">John Canaparius</a> wrote the first "Vita" in 999. Another famous biographer of St. Adalbert was <a href="Bruno%20of%20Querfurt">St. Bruno of Querfurt</a> who wrote a hagiography of him in 1001-4.

Notably, the Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia initially refused to ransom St. Adalbert's body from the Prussians who murdered him, and therefore it was purchased by Poles. This fact may be explained by the Saint belonging to the Slavniks family which was rival to the Přemyslids. Thus St. Adalbert's bones were preserved in <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a>, which assisted <a href="Boleslaus%20I%20of%20Poland">Boleslaus I of Poland</a> in increasing Polish political and diplomatic power in Europe.

According to Bohemian accounts, in 1039 the Bohemian Duke <a href="Bretislaus%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bohemia">Břetislav I</a> looted the bones of St. Adalbert from <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a> in a raid and translated them to <a href="Prague">Prague</a>. According to Polish accounts, however, he stole the wrong relics, namely those of <a href="St.%20Gaudentius">St. Gaudentius</a>, while the Poles concealed St. Adalbert's relics, and consequently remain in <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a>. In 1127 his severed head, which was not in the original purchase according to "Roczniki Polskie", was discovered and translated to <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a>. In 1928, one of the arms of St. Adalbert, which Bolesław I had given to <a href="Otto%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Otto III</a> in 1000, was added to the bones preserved in Gniezno. Therefore, today St. Adalbert has two elaborate shrines in the <a href="Prague%20Cathedral">Prague Cathedral</a> and <a href="Gniezno%20Cathedral">Royal Cathedral of Gniezno</a>, each of which claims to possess his relics, but which of their bones are his authentic relics is unknown. For example, pursuant to both claims the Saint has two skulls. The one in Gniezno was stolen in 1923.

The massive bronze <a href="Gniezno%20Doors">doors</a> of <a href="Gniezno%20Cathedral">Gniezno Cathedral</a>, dating from around 1175, are decorated with eighteen <a href="relief">relief</a>s of scenes from the Saint's life. They are the only <a href="Romanesque%20art">Romanesque</a> ecclesiastical doors in Europe depicting a cycle illustrating the life of a saint, and therefore are a precious relic documenting Adalbert's martyrdom.

23 April 1997 was the one thousandth anniversary of St. Adalbert's martyrdom. It was commemorated in <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, and other nations. Representatives of <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="Greek%20Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a>, and Evangelical churches traveled on a pilgrimage to the Saint's tomb located in Gniezno. <a href="John%20Paul%20II">Pope St. John Paul II</a> visited the cathedral and celebrated a liturgy there in which heads of seven European nations and approximately one million faithful participated.

A ten-meter cross was erected near the village of Beregovoe (formerly Tenkitten), <a href="Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a> where St. Adalbert is thought to have been martyred by the Prussians.

Ælfheah of Canterbury

Ælfheah (<a href="circa">c.</a> 953 – 19 April 1012) was an <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, later <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. He became an <a href="anchorite">anchorite</a> before being elected abbot of <a href="Bath%20Abbey">Bath Abbey</a>. His reputation for piety and sanctity led to his promotion to the <a href="Bishop">episcopate</a>, and eventually, to his becoming archbishop. Ælfheah furthered the cult of <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a> and also encouraged learning. He was captured by <a href="Viking">Viking</a> raiders in 1011 and killed by them the following year after refusing to allow himself to be ransomed. Ælfheah was <a href="Canonization">canonised</a> as a <a href="saint">saint</a> in 1078. <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, a later Archbishop of Canterbury, prayed to him just before his own murder in <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>.

Purportedly born in <a href="Weston%2C%20Bath">Weston</a> on the outskirts of Bath, Ælfheah became a monk early in life. His birth took place around 953. He first entered the monastery of <a href="Deerhurst">Deerhurst</a>, but then moved to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity, and rose to become <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of Bath Abbey. The 12th century chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> recorded that Ælfheah was a monk and prior at <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury Abbey</a>, but this is not accepted by all historians. Indications are that Ælfheah became abbot at Bath by 982, perhaps as early as around 977. He perhaps shared authority with his predecessor Æscwig after 968.

Probably due to the influence of Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury (959–988), Ælfheah was elected Bishop of Winchester in 984, and was consecrated on 19 October that year. While bishop he was largely responsible for the construction of a large <a href="Pipe%20organ">organ</a> in the <a href="Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">cathedral</a>, audible from over a mile (1600 m) away and said to require more than 24 men to operate. He also built and enlarged the city's churches, and promoted the cult of <a href="Swithun">Swithun</a> and his own predecessor, <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Winchester">Æthelwold of Winchester</a>. One act promoting Æthelwold's cult was the <a href="translation%20%28relic%29">translation</a> of Æthelwold's body to a new tomb in the cathedral at Winchester, which Ælfheah presided over on 10 September 996.

Following a Viking raid in 994, a peace treaty was agreed with one of the raiders, <a href="Olaf%20I%20of%20Norway">Olaf Tryggvason</a>. Besides receiving <a href="danegeld">danegeld</a>, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again. Ælfheah may have played a part in the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.

In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded <a href="%C3%86lfric%20of%20Abingdon">Ælfric</a> as Archbishop of Canterbury, taking Swithun's head with him as a <a href="relic">relic</a> for the new location. He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his <a href="pallium">pallium</a>—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope <a href="Pope%20John%20XVIII">John XVIII</a>, but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he promoted the cult of Dunstan, ordering the writing of the second "Life of Dunstan", which <a href="Adelard%20of%20Ghent">Adelard of Ghent</a> composed between 1006 and 1011. He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and was instrumental in the <a href="Witenagemot">Witenagemot</a>'s recognition of <a href="Wulfsige%20III">Wulfsige of Sherborne</a> as a saint in about 1012.

Ælfheah sent <a href="%C3%86lfric%20of%20Eynsham">Ælfric of Eynsham</a> to <a href="Cerne%20Abbey">Cerne Abbey</a> to take charge of its monastic school. He was present at the council of May 1008 at which <a href="Wulfstan%20II">Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York</a>, preached his "<a href="Sermo%20Lupi%20ad%20Anglos">Sermo Lupi ad Anglos</a>" ("The Sermon of the Wolf to the English"), castigating the English for their moral failings and blaming the latter for the tribulations afflicting the country.

In 1011 the <a href="Viking">Danes</a> again raided England, and from 8–29 September they laid siege to Canterbury. Aided by the treachery of Ælfmaer, whose life Ælfheah had once saved, the raiders succeeded in sacking the city. Ælfheah was taken prisoner and held captive for seven months. <a href="Godwine%20I">Godwine</a> (<a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>), <a href="Leofrun">Leofrun</a> (abbess of St Mildrith's), and the king's <a href="Reeve%20%28England%29">reeve</a>, Ælfweard were captured also, but the abbot of <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a>, <a href="%C3%86lfm%C3%A6r%20%28Bishop%20of%20Sherborne%29">Ælfmær</a>, managed to escape. Canterbury Cathedral was plundered and burned by the Danes following Ælfheah's capture.

Ælfheah refused to allow a ransom to be paid for his freedom, and as a result was killed on 19 April 1012 at <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> (then in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, now part of London), reputedly on the site of <a href="St%20Alfege%20Church%2C%20Greenwich">St Alfege's Church</a>. The account of Ælfheah's death appears in the E version of the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>": 

Ælfheah was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to die a violent death. A contemporary report tells that <a href="Thorkell%20the%20Tall">Thorkell the Tall</a> attempted to save Ælfheah from the mob about to kill him by offering everything he owned except for his ship, in exchange for Ælfheah's life; Thorkell's presence is not mentioned in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", however. Some sources record that the final blow, with the back of an axe, was delivered as an <a href="Coup%20de%20gr%C3%A2ce">act of kindness</a> by a Christian convert known as "Thrum." Ælfheah was buried in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. In 1023 his body was moved by King <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> to <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, with great ceremony. Thorkell the Tall was appalled at the brutality of his fellow raiders, and switched sides to the English king <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred the Unready</a> following Ælfheah's death.

Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Gregory VII</a> canonised Ælfheah in 1078, with a <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints">feast day</a> of 19 April. <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, the first <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">post-Conquest</a> archbishop, was dubious about some of the saints venerated at Canterbury. He was persuaded of Ælfheah's sanctity, but Ælfheah and <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a> were the only pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon archbishops kept on Canterbury's calendar of saints. Ælfheah's shrine, which had become neglected, was rebuilt and expanded in the early 12th century under <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>, who was instrumental in retaining Ælfheah's name in the church calendar. After the 1174 fire in Canterbury Cathedral, Ælfheah's remains together with those of Dunstan were placed around the high altar, at which Thomas Becket is said to have commended his life into Ælfheah's care shortly before his martyrdom during the <a href="Becket%20controversy">Becket controversy</a>. The new shrine was sealed in lead, and was north of the high altar, sharing the honour with Dunstan's shrine, which was located south of the high altar. A "Life of Saint Ælfheah" in prose and verse was written by a Canterbury monk named <a href="Osbern%20of%20Canterbury">Osbern</a>, at Lanfranc's request. The prose version has survived, but the "Life" is very much a <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a>: many of the stories it contains have obvious Biblical parallels, making them suspect as a historical record.

In the late medieval period, Ælfheah's feast day was celebrated in Scandinavia, perhaps because of the saint's connection with Cnut. Few church dedications to him are known, with most of them occurring in Kent and one each in London and Winchester; as well as <a href="St%20Alfege%27s%20Church">St Alfege's Church</a> in Greenwich, a <a href="St%20Alfege%27s%20Hospital">nearby hospital</a> (1931–1968) was named after him. In the town of Solihull in the West Midlands <a href="St%20Alphege%20Church%2C%20Solihull">St Alphege Church</a> is dedicated to Ælfheah dating back to approximately 1277. In 1929 a new church in Bath was dedicated to Ælfheah, under the name Alphege, designed by <a href="Giles%20Gilbert%20Scott">Giles Gilbert Scott</a> in homage to the ancient Roman church of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20in%20Cosmedin">Santa Maria in Cosmedin</a>.

<doc id="2112" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112" title="Associative algebra">
Associative algebra

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, an associative algebra is an <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a> with compatible operations of addition, multiplication (assumed to be <a href="associative%20property">associative</a>), and a <a href="scalar%20multiplication">scalar multiplication</a> by elements in some <a href="Field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a>. The addition and multiplication operations together give "A" the structure of a <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a>; the addition and scalar multiplication operations together give "A" the structure of a <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a> over "K". In this article we will also use the term <a href="algebra%20over%20a%20field">"K"-algebra"'</a> to mean an associative algebra over the field "K". A standard first example of a "K"-algebra is a ring of <a href="Square%20matrix">square matrices</a> over a field "K", with the usual <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>. 

In this article associative algebras are assumed to have a multiplicative unit, denoted 1; they are sometimes called unital associative algebras for clarification. In some areas of mathematics this assumption is not made, and we will call such structures <a href="unital%20algebra">non-unital</a> associative algebras. We will also assume that all rings are unital, and all ring homomorphisms are unital.

Many authors consider the more general concept of an associative algebra over a <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a> "R", instead of a field: An "R"-algebra is an <a href="Module%20%28mathematics%29">"R"-module</a> with an associative "R"-bilinear binary operation, which also contains a multiplicative identity. For examples of this concept, if "S" is any ring with <a href="center%20%28ring%20theory%29">center</a> "C", then "S" is an associative "C"-algebra.

Let "R" be a fixed <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a> (so "R" could be a field). An associative "R"-algebra (or more simply, an "R"-algebra) is an additive <a href="abelian%20group">abelian group</a> "A" which has the structure of both a <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a> and an <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">"R"-module</a> in such a way that the <a href="scalar%20multiplication">scalar multiplication</a> satisfies
for all "r" ∈ "R" and "x", "y" ∈ "A". Furthermore, "A" is assumed to be unital, which is to say it contains an element 1 such that
for all "x" ∈ "A". Note that such an element 1 must be unique.

In other words, "A" is an "R"-module together with (1) an <a href="bilinear%20map">"R"-bilinear map</a> "A" × "A" → "A", called the multiplication, and (2) the multiplicative identity, such that the multiplication is associative:
for all "x", "y", and "z" in "A". (Technical note: the multiplicative identity is a datum, while associativity is a property. By the uniqueness of the multiplicative identity, "unitarity" is often treated like a property.) If one drops the requirement for the associativity, then one obtains a <a href="non-associative%20algebra">non-associative algebra</a>.

If "A" itself is commutative (as a ring) then it is called a commutative "R"-algebra.

The definition is equivalent to saying that a unital associative "R"-algebra is a <a href="monoid%20%28category%20theory%29">monoid object</a> in <a href="category%20of%20modules">"R"-Mod</a> (the <a href="monoidal%20category">monoidal category</a> of "R"-modules). By definition, a ring is a monoid object in the <a href="category%20of%20abelian%20groups">category of abelian groups</a>; thus, the notion of an associative algebra is obtained by replacing the category of abelian groups with the category of modules.

Pushing this idea further, some authors have introduced a "generalized ring" as a monoid object in some other category that behaves like the category of modules. Indeed, this reinterpretation allows one to avoid making an explicit reference to elements of an algebra "A". For example, the associativity can be expressed as follows. By the universal property of a <a href="tensor%20product%20of%20modules">tensor product of modules</a>, the multiplication (the "R"-bilinear map) corresponds to a unique "R"-linear map
The associativity then refers to the identity:

An associative algebra amounts to a <a href="ring%20homomorphism">ring homomorphism</a> whose image lies in the center. Indeed, starting with a ring "A" and a ring homomorphism formula_6 whose image lies in the <a href="center%20%28ring%20theory%29">center</a> of "A", we can make "A" an "R"-algebra by defining
for all "r" ∈ "R" and "x" ∈ "A". If "A" is an "R"-algebra, taking "x" = 1, the same formula in turn defines a ring homomorphism formula_6 whose image lies in the center.

If "A" is commutative then the center of "A" is equal to "A", so that a commutative "R"-algebra can be defined simply as a homomorphism formula_6 of commutative rings.

The ring homomorphism η appearing in the above is often called a <a href="structure%20map">structure map</a>. In the commutative case, one can consider the category whose objects are ring homomorphisms "R" → "A"; i.e., commutative "R"-algebras and whose morphisms are ring homomorphisms "A" → "A" that are under "R"; i.e., "R" → "A" → "A" is "R" → "A" (i.e., the <a href="coslice%20category">coslice category</a> of the category of commutative rings under "R".) The <a href="prime%20spectrum">prime spectrum</a> functor Spec then determines an anti-equivalence of this category to the category of <a href="affine%20scheme">affine scheme</a>s over Spec "R".

How to weaken the commutativity assumption is a subject matter of <a href="noncommutative%20algebraic%20geometry">noncommutative algebraic geometry</a> and, more recently, of <a href="derived%20algebraic%20geometry">derived algebraic geometry</a>. See also: <a href="generic%20matrix%20ring">generic matrix ring</a>.

A <a href="homomorphism">homomorphism</a> between two "R"-algebras is an "R"-linear <a href="ring%20homomorphism">ring homomorphism</a>. Explicitly, formula_10 is an associative algebra homomorphism if

The class of all "R"-algebras together with algebra homomorphisms between them form a <a href="category%20%28mathematics%29">category</a>, sometimes denoted "R"-Alg.

The <a href="subcategory">subcategory</a> of commutative "R"-algebras can be characterized as the <a href="coslice%20category">coslice category</a> "R"/CRing where CRing is the <a href="category%20of%20commutative%20rings">category of commutative rings</a>.

The most basic example is a ring itself; it is an algebra over its center or any subring lying in the center. In particular, any commutative ring is an algebra over any of its subrings. Other examples abound both from algebra and other fields of mathematics.

Algebra

Representation theory

Analysis

Geometry and combinatorics


An associative algebra over "K" is given by a "K"-vector space "A" endowed with a bilinear map "A"×"A"→"A" having 2 inputs (multiplicator and multiplicand) and one output (product), as well as a morphism "K"→"A" identifying the scalar multiples of the multiplicative identity. If the bilinear map "A"×"A"→"A" is reinterpreted as a linear map (i. e., <a href="morphism">morphism</a> in the category of "K"-vector spaces) "A"⊗"A"→"A" (by the <a href="Tensor%20product%23Characterization%20by%20a%20universal%20property">universal property of the tensor product</a>), then we can view an associative algebra over "K" as a "K"-vector space "A" endowed with two morphisms (one of the form "A"⊗"A"→"A" and one of the form "K"→"A") satisfying certain conditions which boil down to the algebra axioms. These two morphisms can be dualized using <a href="categorial%20duality">categorial duality</a> by reversing all arrows in the <a href="commutative%20diagram">commutative diagram</a>s which describe the algebra <a href="axiom">axiom</a>s; this defines the structure of a <a href="coalgebra">coalgebra</a>.

There is also an abstract notion of <a href="F-coalgebra">F-coalgebra</a>, where "F" is a <a href="functor">functor</a>. This is vaguely related to the notion of coalgebra discussed above.

A <a href="representation%20theory">representation</a> of an algebra "A" is an algebra homomorphism ρ: "A" → End("V") from "A" to the endomorphism algebra of some vector space (or module) "V". The property of ρ being an algebra homomorphism means that ρ preserves the multiplicative operation (that is, ρ("xy")=ρ("x")ρ("y") for all "x" and "y" in "A"), and that ρ sends the unity of "A" to the unity of End("V") (that is, to the identity endomorphism of "V").

If "A" and "B" are two algebras, and ρ: "A" → End("V") and τ: "B" → End("W") are two representations, then there is a (canonical) representation "A formula_15 B" → End("V formula_15 W") of the tensor product algebra "A formula_15 B" on the vector space "V formula_15 W". However, there is no natural way of defining a <a href="tensor%20product">tensor product</a> of two representations of a single associative algebra in such a way that the result is still a representation of that same algebra (not of its tensor product with itself), without somehow imposing additional conditions. Here, by "<a href="tensor%20product%20of%20representations">tensor product of representations</a>", the usual meaning is intended: the result should be a linear representation of the same algebra on the product vector space. Imposing such additional structure typically leads to the idea of a <a href="Hopf%20algebra">Hopf algebra</a> or a <a href="Lie%20algebra">Lie algebra</a>, as demonstrated below.

Consider, for example, two representations formula_19 and formula_20. One might try to form a tensor product representation formula_21 according to how it acts on the product vector space, so that

However, such a map would not be linear, since one would have

for "k" ∈ "K". One can rescue this attempt and restore linearity by imposing additional structure, by defining an algebra homomorphism Δ: "A" → "A" ⊗ "A", and defining the tensor product representation as

Such a homomorphism Δ is called a <a href="comultiplication">comultiplication</a> if it satisfies certain axioms. The resulting structure is called a <a href="bialgebra">bialgebra</a>. To be consistent with the definitions of the associative algebra, the coalgebra must be co-associative, and, if the algebra is unital, then the co-algebra must be co-unital as well. A <a href="Hopf%20algebra">Hopf algebra</a> is a bialgebra with an additional piece of structure (the so-called antipode), which allows not only to define the tensor product of two representations, but also the Hom module of two representations (again, similarly to how it is done in the representation theory of groups).

One can try to be more clever in defining a tensor product. Consider, for example,

so that the action on the tensor product space is given by

This map is clearly linear in "x", and so it does not have the problem of the earlier definition. However, it fails to preserve multiplication:

But, in general, this does not equal

This shows that this definition of a tensor product is too naive; the obvious fix is to define it such that it is antisymmetric, so that the middle two terms cancel. This leads to the concept of a <a href="Lie%20algebra">Lie algebra</a>.

Some authors use the term "associative algebra" to refer to structures which do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity, and hence consider homomorphisms which are not necessarily unital. 

An example of a non-unital associative algebra is given by the set of all functions "f": R → R whose <a href="limit%20of%20a%20function">limit</a> as "x" nears infinity is zero.

<doc id="2113" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2113" title="Axiom of regularity">
Axiom of regularity

In mathematics, the axiom of regularity (also known as the axiom of foundation) is an axiom of <a href="Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel%20set%20theory">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a> that states that every non-empty <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> "A" contains an element that is disjoint from "A". In <a href="first-order%20logic">first-order logic</a>, the axiom reads:
The axiom implies that no set is an element of itself, and that there is no infinite <a href="sequence">sequence</a> ("a") such that "a" is an element of "a" for all "i". With the <a href="axiom%20of%20dependent%20choice">axiom of dependent choice</a> (which is a weakened form of the <a href="axiom%20of%20choice">axiom of choice</a>), this result can be reversed: if there are no such infinite sequences, then the axiom of regularity is true. Hence, the axiom of regularity is equivalent, given the axiom of dependent choice, to the alternative axiom that there are no downward infinite membership chains.

The axiom of regularity was introduced by ; it was adopted in a formulation closer to the one found in contemporary textbooks by . Virtually all results in the branches of mathematics based on set theory hold even in the absence of regularity; see chapter 3 of . However, regularity makes some properties of <a href="Ordinal%20number">ordinals</a> easier to prove; and it not only allows induction to be done on <a href="well-ordering">well-ordered sets</a> but also on proper classes that are <a href="well-founded%20relation">well-founded relational structures</a> such as the <a href="lexicographical%20ordering">lexicographical ordering</a> on formula_2

Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the axiom of regularity is equivalent to the <a href="epsilon-induction">axiom of induction</a>. The axiom of induction tends to be used in place of the axiom of regularity in <a href="intuitionism">intuitionistic</a> theories (ones that do not accept the <a href="law%20of%20the%20excluded%20middle">law of the excluded middle</a>), where the two axioms are not equivalent.

In addition to omitting the axiom of regularity, <a href="Non-well-founded%20set%20theory">non-standard set theories</a> have indeed postulated the existence of sets that are elements of themselves.

Let "A" be a set, and apply the axiom of regularity to {"A"}, which is a set by the <a href="axiom%20of%20pairing">axiom of pairing</a>. We see that there must be an element of {"A"} which is disjoint from {"A"}. Since the only element of {"A"} is "A", it must be that "A" is disjoint from {"A"}. So, since "A" ∈ {"A"}, we cannot have "A" ∈ "A" (by the definition of <a href="Disjoint%20sets">disjoint</a>).

Suppose, to the contrary, that there is a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a>, "f", on the <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s with "f"("n"+1) an element of "f"("n") for each "n". Define "S" = {"f"("n"): "n" a natural number}, the range of "f", which can be seen to be a set from the <a href="axiom%20schema%20of%20replacement">axiom schema of replacement</a>. Applying the axiom of regularity to "S", let "B" be an element of "S" which is disjoint from "S". By the definition of "S", "B" must be "f"("k") for some natural number "k". However, we are given that "f"("k") contains "f"("k"+1) which is also an element of "S". So "f"("k"+1) is in the intersection of "f"("k") and "S". This contradicts the fact that they are disjoint sets. Since our supposition led to a contradiction, there must not be any such function, "f".

The nonexistence of a set containing itself can be seen as a special case where the sequence is infinite and constant.

Notice that this argument only applies to functions "f" that can be represented as sets as opposed to undefinable classes. The <a href="hereditarily%20finite%20set">hereditarily finite set</a>s, V, satisfy the axiom of regularity (and all other axioms of <a href="ZFC">ZFC</a> except the <a href="axiom%20of%20infinity">axiom of infinity</a>). So if one forms a non-trivial <a href="ultraproduct">ultrapower</a> of V, then it will also satisfy the axiom of regularity. The resulting <a href="model%20%28logic%29">model</a> will contain elements, called non-standard natural numbers, that satisfy the definition of natural numbers in that model but are not really natural numbers. They are fake natural numbers which are "larger" than any actual natural number. This model will contain infinite descending sequences of elements. For example, suppose "n" is a non-standard natural number, then formula_3 and formula_4, and so on. For any actual natural number "k", formula_5. This is an unending descending sequence of elements. But this sequence is not definable in the model and thus not a set. So no contradiction to regularity can be proved.

The axiom of regularity enables defining the ordered pair ("a","b") as <nowiki>{</nowiki>"a",<nowiki>{</nowiki>"a","b"<nowiki>}}</nowiki>. See <a href="ordered%20pair">ordered pair</a> for specifics. This definition eliminates one pair of braces from the canonical <a href="Kuratowski">Kuratowski</a> definition ("a","b") = <nowiki></nowiki>.

This was actually the original form of von Neumann's axiomatization.

Let "X" and "Y" be sets. Then apply the axiom of regularity to the set {"X","Y"}. We see there must be an element of {"X","Y"} which is also disjoint from it. It must be either "X" or "Y". By the definition of disjoint then, we must have either "Y" is not an element of "X" or vice versa.

Let the non-empty set "S" be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, every element of "S" has a non-empty intersection with "S". We define a binary relation "R" on "S" by formula_6, which is entire by assumption. Thus, by the axiom of dependent choice, there is some sequence ("a") in "S" satisfying "aRa" for all "n" in N. As this is an infinite descending chain, we arrive at a contradiction and so, no such "S" exists.

Regularity was shown to be relatively consistent with the rest of ZF by and , meaning that if ZF without regularity is consistent, then ZF (with regularity) is also consistent. For his proof in modern notation see for instance.

The axiom of regularity was also shown to be <a href="Independence%20%28mathematical%20logic%29">independent</a> from the other axioms of ZF(C), assuming they are consistent. The result was announced by <a href="Paul%20Bernays">Paul Bernays</a> in 1941, although he did not publish a proof until 1954. The proof involves (and led to the study of) <a href="Rieger-Bernays%20permutation">Rieger-Bernays permutation</a> models (or method), which were used for other proofs of independence for non-well-founded systems ( and ).

<a href="Naive%20set%20theory">Naive set theory</a> (the axiom schema of <a href="unrestricted%20comprehension">unrestricted comprehension</a> and the <a href="axiom%20of%20extensionality">axiom of extensionality</a>) is inconsistent due to <a href="Russell%27s%20paradox">Russell's paradox</a>. In early formalizations of sets, mathematicians and logicians have avoided that contradiction by replacing the axiom schema of comprehension with the much weaker <a href="axiom%20schema%20of%20separation">axiom schema of separation</a>. However, this step alone takes one to theories of sets which are considered too weak. So some of the power of comprehension was added back via the other existence axioms of ZF set theory (pairing, union, powerset, replacement, and infinity) which may be regarded as special cases of comprehension. So far, these axioms do not seem to lead to any contradiction. Subsequently, the axiom of choice and the axiom of regularity were added to exclude models with some undesirable properties. These two axioms are known to be relatively consistent.

In the presence of the axiom schema of separation, Russell's paradox becomes a proof that there is no <a href="universal%20set">set of all sets</a>. The axiom of regularity (with the axiom of pairing) also prohibits such a universal set, however this prohibition is redundant when added to the rest of ZF. If the ZF axioms without regularity were already inconsistent, then adding regularity would not make them consistent.

The existence of <a href="Quine%20atom">Quine atom</a>s (sets that satisfy the formula equation "x" = {"x"}, i.e. have themselves as their only elements) is consistent with the theory obtained by removing the axiom of regularity from ZFC. Various <a href="non-well-founded%20set%20theory">non-wellfounded set theories</a> allow "safe" circular sets, such as Quine atoms, without becoming inconsistent by means of Russell's paradox.

In ZF it can be proven that the class formula_7, called the <a href="von%20Neumann%20universe">von Neumann universe</a>, is equal to the class of all sets. This statement is even equivalent to the axiom of regularity (if we work in ZF with this axiom omitted). From any model which does not satisfy axiom of regularity, a model which satisfies it can be constructed by taking only sets in formula_7.

In the same paper, Scott shows that an axiomatic system based on the inherent properties of the cumulative hierarchy turns out to be equivalent to ZF, including regularity.

The concept of well-foundedness and <a href="Von%20Neumann%20universe">rank</a> of a set were both introduced by <a href="Dmitry%20Mirimanoff">Dmitry Mirimanoff</a> (<a href="%23">1917</a>) cf. and . Mirimanoff called a set "x" "regular" (French: "ordinaire") if every descending chain "x" ∋ "x" ∋ "x" ∋ ... is finite. Mirimanoff however did not consider his notion of regularity (and well-foundedness) as an axiom to be observed by all sets ; in later papers Mirimanoff also explored what are now called <a href="non-well-founded%20set%20theory">non-well-founded sets</a> ("extraordinaire" in Mirimanoff's terminology) .

IBM AIX

AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive, pronounced ) is a series of <a href="Proprietary%20software">proprietary</a> <a href="Unix">Unix</a> <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s developed and sold by <a href="IBM">IBM</a> for several of its computer platforms. Originally released for the <a href="IBM%206150%20RT">IBM 6150</a> <a href="RISC">RISC</a> <a href="workstation">workstation</a>, AIX now supports or has supported a wide variety of hardware platforms, including the IBM <a href="RS/6000">RS/6000</a> series and later <a href="IBM%20POWER%20microprocessors">POWER</a> and <a href="PowerPC">PowerPC</a>-based systems, <a href="IBM%20System%20i">IBM System i</a>, <a href="System/370">System/370</a> mainframes, <a href="IBM%20Personal%20System/2">PS/2</a> <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s, and the <a href="Apple%20Network%20Server">Apple Network Server</a>.

AIX is based on <a href="UNIX%20System%20V">UNIX System V</a> with <a href="4.3BSD">4.3BSD</a>-compatible extensions. It is one of six commercial operating systems that have versions certified to <a href="The%20Open%20Group">The Open Group</a>'s UNIX 03 standard (the others being <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, <a href="Solaris%20%28operating%20system%29">Solaris</a>, <a href="Inspur%20K-UX">Inspur K-UX</a>, <a href="HP-UX">HP-UX</a>, and <a href="eulerOS">eulerOS</a> ).

The AIX family of operating systems debuted in 1986, became the standard operating system for the <a href="RS/6000">RS/6000</a> series on its launch in 1990, and is still actively developed by IBM. It is currently supported on <a href="IBM%20Power%20Systems">IBM Power Systems</a> alongside <a href="IBM%20i">IBM i</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a>.

AIX was the first operating system to have a <a href="journaling%20file%20system">journaling file system</a>, and IBM has continuously enhanced the software with features such as processor, disk and network <a href="virtualization">virtualization</a>, dynamic hardware resource allocation (including fractional processor units), and <a href="reliability%20engineering">reliability engineering</a> ported from its <a href="mainframe%20computer">mainframe</a> designs.

Unix started life at <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a>'s <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> research center in the early 1970s, running on <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">DEC</a> <a href="minicomputer">minicomputer</a>s. By 1976, the operating system was in use at various academic institutions, including <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a>, where Tom Lyon and others ported it to the S/370, to run as a guest OS under <a href="VM%20%28operating%20system%29">VM/370</a>. This port would later grow out to become <a href="Amdahl%20UTS">UTS</a>, a mainframe Unix offering by IBM's competitor <a href="Amdahl%20Corporation">Amdahl Corporation</a>.
IBM's own involvement in Unix can be dated to 1979, when it assisted Bell Labs in doing its own Unix port to the 370 (to be used as a <a href="Software%20build">build host</a> for the <a href="5ESS%20switch">5ESS switch</a>'s software). In the process, IBM made modifications to the <a href="TSS/370">TSS/370</a> <a href="hypervisor">hypervisor</a> to better support Unix.

It took until 1985 for IBM to offer its own Unix on the S/370 platform, IX/370, which was developed by <a href="Interactive%20Systems%20Corporation">Interactive Systems Corporation</a> and intended by IBM to compete with Amdahl UTS. The operating system offered special facilities for interoperating with <a href="PC/IX">PC/IX</a>, Interactive/IBM's version of Unix for <a href="IBM%20PC%20compatible">IBM PC compatible</a> hardware, and was licensed at $10,000 per sixteen concurrent users.

AIX Version 1, introduced in 1986 for the <a href="IBM%206150%20RT">IBM 6150 RT</a> <a href="computer%20workstation">workstation</a>, was based on <a href="UNIX%20System%20V">UNIX System V</a> Releases 1 and 2. In developing AIX, IBM and <a href="Interactive%20Systems%20Corporation">Interactive Systems Corporation</a> (whom IBM contracted) also incorporated source code from 4.2 and 4.3 <a href="BSD">BSD</a> UNIX.

Among other variants, IBM later produced AIX Version 3 (also known as AIX/6000), based on System V Release 3, for their <a href="IBM%20POWER%20Instruction%20Set%20Architecture">POWER</a>-based <a href="RS/6000">RS/6000</a> platform. Since 1990, AIX has served as the primary operating system for the RS/6000 series (later renamed "<a href="IBM%20eServer">IBM eServer</a> pSeries", then "<a href="IBM%20System%20p">IBM System p</a>", and now "<a href="IBM%20Power%20Systems">IBM Power Systems</a>"). AIX Version 4, introduced in 1994, added <a href="symmetric%20multiprocessing">symmetric multiprocessing</a> with the introduction of the first RS/6000 SMP servers and continued to evolve through the 1990s, culminating with AIX 4.3.3 in 1999. Version 4.1, in a slightly modified form, was also the standard operating system for the <a href="Apple%20Network%20Server">Apple Network Server</a> systems sold by <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple Computer</a> to complement the <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> line.

In the late 1990s, under <a href="Project%20Monterey">Project Monterey</a>, IBM and the <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Operation">Santa Cruz Operation</a> planned to integrate AIX and <a href="UnixWare">UnixWare</a> into a single <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a>/<a href="64-bit%20computing">64-bit</a> multiplatform UNIX with particular emphasis on running on <a href="Intel">Intel</a> <a href="Itanium">IA-64</a> (Itanium) architecture CPUs. A <a href="beta%20test">beta test</a> version of AIX 5L for IA-64 systems was released, but according to documents released in the "<a href="SCO%20v.%20IBM">SCO v. IBM</a>" lawsuit, less than forty licenses for the finished Monterey Unix were ever sold before the project was terminated in 2002. In 2003, the <a href="SCO%20Group">SCO Group</a> alleged that (among other infractions) IBM had misappropriated licensed <a href="source%20code">source code</a> from <a href="UNIX%20System%20V">UNIX System V</a> Release 4 for incorporation into AIX; SCO subsequently withdrew IBM's license to develop and distribute AIX. IBM maintains that their license was irrevocable, and continued to sell and support the product until the litigation was adjudicated.

AIX was a component of the 2003 "<a href="SCO%20v.%20IBM">SCO v. IBM</a>" lawsuit, in which the <a href="SCO%20Group">SCO Group</a> filed a lawsuit against IBM, alleging IBM contributed SCO's <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> to the <a href="Linux%20kernel">Linux</a> codebase. The <a href="SCO%20Group">SCO Group</a>, who argued they were the rightful owners of the copyrights covering the <a href="Unix">Unix</a> operating system, attempted to revoke IBM's license to sell or distribute the AIX operating system. In March 2010, a jury returned a verdict finding that <a href="Novell">Novell</a>, not the SCO Group, owns the rights to Unix.

AIX 6 was announced in May 2007, and it ran as an open beta from June 2007 until the general availability (GA) of AIX 6.1 on November 9, 2007. Major new features in AIX 6.1 included full <a href="role-based%20access%20control">role-based access control</a>, <a href="workload%20partitions">workload partitions</a> (which enable application mobility), enhanced security (Addition of AES encryption type for NFS v3 and v4), and <a href="Live%20Partition%20Mobility">Live Partition Mobility</a> on the POWER6 hardware.

AIX 7.1 was announced in April 2010, and an open beta ran until general availability of AIX 7.1 in September 2010. Several new features, including better scalability, enhanced clustering and management capabilities were added. AIX 7.1 includes a new built-in clustering capability called Cluster Aware AIX. AIX is able to organize multiple LPARs through the multipath communications channel to neighboring CPUs, enabling very high-speed communication between processors. This enables multi-terabyte memory address range and page table access to support global petabyte shared memory space for AIX POWER7 clusters so that software developers can program a cluster as if it were a single system, without using message passing (i.e. semaphore-controlled Inter-process Communication). AIX administrators can use this new capability to cluster a pool of AIX nodes. By default, AIX V7.1 pins kernel memory and includes support to allow applications to pin their kernel stack. Pinning kernel memory and the kernel stack for applications with real-time requirements can provide performance improvements by ensuring that the kernel memory and kernel stack for an application is not paged out.

AIX 7.2 was announced in October 2015, and released in December 2015. AIX 7.2 principal feature is the Live Kernel Update capability which allows OS fixes to replace the entire AIX kernel with no impact to applications. AIX 7.2 was also restructured to remove obsolete components. The networking component, bos.net.tcp.client was repackaged to allow additional installation flexibility. Unlike AIX 7.1, AIX 7.2 is only supported on systems based on POWER7 or later processors.

The original AIX (sometimes called AIX/RT) was developed for the IBM 6150 RT workstation by IBM in conjunction with <a href="Interactive%20Systems%20Corporation">Interactive Systems Corporation</a>, who had previously ported <a href="UNIX%20System%20III">UNIX System III</a> to the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> for IBM as <a href="PC/IX">PC/IX</a>. According to its developers, the AIX source (for this initial version) consisted of one million lines of code. Installation media consisted of eight <a href="Floppy%20disk">1.2M floppy disk</a>s. The RT was based on the <a href="ROMP">ROMP</a> <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>, the first commercial <a href="RISC">RISC</a> chip. This was based on a design pioneered at IBM Research (the <a href="IBM%20801">IBM 801</a>) .

One of the novel aspects of the RT design was the use of a <a href="microkernel">microkernel</a>, called Virtual Resource Manager (VRM). The keyboard, mouse, display, disk drives and network were all controlled by a microkernel. One could "hotkey" from one operating system to the next using the Alt-Tab key combination. Each OS in turn would get possession of the keyboard, mouse and display. Besides AIX v2, the <a href="PICK%20OS">PICK OS</a> also included this microkernel.

Much of the AIX v2 kernel was written in the <a href="PL/8">PL/8</a> programming language, which proved troublesome during the migration to AIX v3. AIX v2 included full <a href="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> networking, as well as <a href="Systems%20Network%20Architecture">SNA</a> and two networking file systems: <a href="Network%20File%20System%20%28protocol%29">NFS</a>, licensed from <a href="Sun%20Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>, and <a href="Distributed%20Services">Distributed Services</a> (DS). DS had the distinction of being built on top of SNA, and thereby being fully compatible with DS on the IBM midrange <a href="IBM%20System%20i">AS/400</a> and mainframe systems. For the graphical user interfaces, AIX v2 came with the X10R3 and later the X10R4 and X11 versions of the <a href="X%20Window%20System">X Window System</a> from MIT, together with the <a href="Xaw">Athena widget set</a>. Compilers for <a href="Fortran">Fortran</a> and <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> were available. One of the more popular desktop applications was the <a href="PageMaker">PageMaker</a> <a href="desktop%20publishing">desktop publishing</a> software.

AIX PS/2 (also known as AIX/386) was developed by <a href="Locus%20Computing%20Corporation">Locus Computing Corporation</a> under contract to IBM. AIX PS/2, first released in 1987, ran on <a href="IBM%20PS/2">IBM PS/2</a> <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s with <a href="Intel%20386">Intel 386</a> and compatible processors.

The product was announced in September 1988 with a baseline tag price of $595, although some utilities like <a href="uucp">uucp</a> were included in a separate Extension package priced at $250. <a href="nroff">nroff</a> and <a href="troff">troff</a> for AIX were also sold separately in a Text Formatting System package priced at $200. The <a href="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> stack for AIX PS/2 retailed for another $300. The <a href="X%20Window%20System">X Window</a> package was priced at $195, while the C and FORTRAN compilers each had a price tag of $275. Locus also made available their <a href="DOS%20Merge">DOS Merge</a> virtual machine environment for AIX, which could run MS DOS 3.3 applications inside AIX; DOS Merge was sold separately for another $250. IBM also offered a $150 AIX PS/2 DOS Server Program, which provided <a href="file%20server">file server</a> and <a href="print%20server">print server</a> services for client computers running PC DOS 3.3.

The last version of PS/2 AIX is 1.3. It was released in 1992 and announced to add support for non-IBM (non-microchannel) computers as well. Support for PS/2 AIX ended in March 1995.

In 1988, IBM announced AIX/370, also developed by Locus Computing. AIX/370 was IBM's third attempt to offer <a href="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> functionality for their mainframe line, specifically the <a href="System/370">System/370</a> (the prior versions were a <a href="TSS/360">TSS/370</a>-based Unix system developed jointly with AT&T c.1980, and VM/IX, a <a href="VM/370">VM/370</a>-based system developed jointly with <a href="Interactive%20Systems%20Corporation">Interactive Systems Corporation</a> c.1984). AIX/370 was released in 1990 with functional equivalence to System V Release 2 and 4.3BSD as well as IBM enhancements. With the introduction of the <a href="ESA/390">ESA/390</a> architecture, AIX/370 was replaced by AIX/ESA in 1991, which was based on <a href="OSF/1">OSF/1</a>, and also ran on the <a href="System/390">System/390</a> platform. This development effort was made partly to allow IBM to compete with <a href="Amdahl%20Corporation">Amdahl</a> <a href="UTS%20%28Mainframe%20UNIX%29">UTS</a>. Unlike AIX/370, AIX/ESA ran both natively as the host operating system, and as a guest under <a href="VM%20%28Operating%20system%29">VM</a>. AIX/ESA, while technically advanced, had little commercial success, partially because UNIX functionality was added as an option to the existing mainframe operating system, <a href="MVS">MVS</a>, which became <a href="MVS/ESA">MVS/ESA OpenEdition</a> in 1999.
As part of <a href="Project%20Monterey">Project Monterey</a>, IBM released a <a href="beta%20test">beta test</a> version of AIX 5L for the IA-64 (<a href="Itanium">Itanium</a>) architecture in 2001, but this never became an official product due to lack of interest.

The <a href="Apple%20Network%20Server">Apple Network Server</a> systems were PowerPC-based systems designed by <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple Computer</a> to have numerous high-end features that standard Apple hardware did not have, including swappable hard drives, redundant power supplies, and external monitoring capability. These systems were more or less based on the <a href="Power%20Macintosh">Power Macintosh</a> hardware available at the time but were designed to use AIX (versions 4.1.4 or 4.1.5) as their native operating system in a specialized version specific to the ANS.

AIX was only compatible with the Network Servers and was not ported to standard Power Macintosh hardware. Not to be confused is <a href="A/UX">A/UX</a>, Apple's earlier version of Unix for <a href="68k">68k</a>-based <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a>es.

The release of AIX version 3 (sometimes called AIX/6000) coincided with the announcement of the first <a href="POWER1">POWER1</a>-based IBM <a href="RS/6000">RS/6000</a> models in 1990.

AIX v3 innovated in several ways on the software side. It was the first operating system to introduce the idea of a <a href="journaling%20file%20system">journaling file system</a>, <a href="IBM%20Journaled%20File%20System%202%20%28JFS2%29">JFS</a>, which allowed for fast boot times by avoiding the need to ensure the consistency of the file systems on disks (see <a href="fsck">fsck</a>) on every reboot. Another innovation was <a href="shared%20library">shared libraries</a> which avoid the need for static linking from an application to the libraries it used. The resulting smaller binaries used less of the hardware RAM to run, and used less disk space to install. Besides improving performance, it was a boon to developers: executable binaries could be in the tens of <a href="kilobyte">kilobyte</a>s instead of a megabyte for an executable statically linked to the <a href="C%20library">C library</a>. AIX v3 also scrapped the microkernel of AIX v2, a contentious move that resulted in v3 containing no PL/I code and being somewhat more "pure" than v2.

Other notable subsystems included:


, AIX runs on IBM <a href="IBM%20Power%20Systems">Power</a>, <a href="System%20p">System p</a>, <a href="IBM%20System%20i">System i</a>, System p5, System i5, eServer p5, eServer pSeries and eServer i5 server product lines, as well as IBM <a href="BladeCenter">BladeCenter</a> blades and IBM <a href="PureFlex">PureFlex</a> compute nodes based on Power Architecture technology.

AIX 7.1 fully exploits systems based on <a href="POWER7">POWER7</a> processors include the Active Memory Expansion feature, which increases system flexibility where system administrators can configure logical partitions (LPARs) to use less physical memory. For example, an LPAR running AIX appears to the OS applications to be configured with 80 GB of physical memory but the hardware actually only consumes 60 GB of physical memory. Active Memory Expansion is a <a href="virtual%20memory%20compression">virtual memory compression</a> system which employs memory compression technology to transparently compress in-memory data, allowing more data to be placed into memory and thus expanding the memory capacity of POWER7 systems. Using Active Memory Expansion can improve system utilization and increase a system’s throughput. AIX 7 automatically manages the size of memory pages used to automatically use 4 KB, 64 KB or a combination of those page sizes. This self-tuning feature results in optimized performance without administrative effort.

AIX 7.2 exploits <a href="POWER8">POWER8</a> hardware features including accelerators and eight-way hardware multithreading.


 AIX PS/2 (1-16 User Option) $ 795
 AIX PS/2 (1-2 User Option) 595


The default shell was <a href="Bourne%20shell">Bourne shell</a> up to AIX version 3, but was changed to <a href="KornShell">KornShell</a> (ksh88) in version 4 in view of <a href="XPG4">XPG4</a> and <a href="POSIX">POSIX</a> compliance.

The <a href="Common%20Desktop%20Environment">Common Desktop Environment</a> (CDE) is AIX's default <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a>. As part of Linux Affinity and the free <a href="AIX%20Toolbox%20for%20Linux%20Applications">AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications</a> (ATLA), open-source <a href="KDE%20Plasma%20Workspaces">KDE Plasma Workspaces</a> and <a href="GNOME">GNOME</a> desktop are also available.

<a href="IBM%20AIX%20SMIT">SMIT</a> is the System Management Interface Tool for AIX. It allows a user to navigate a menu hierarchy of commands, rather than using the command line. Invocation is typically achieved with the command codice_1. Experienced system administrators make use of the codice_2 function key which generates the command line that SMIT will invoke to complete it.
SMIT also generates a log of commands that are performed in the codice_3 file. The codice_3 file automatically records the commands with the command flags and parameters used. The codice_3 file can be used as an executable shell script to rerun system configuration tasks. SMIT also creates the codice_6 file, which contains additional detailed information that can be used by programmers in extending the SMIT system.

codice_1 and codice_8 refer to the same program, though codice_8 invokes the text-based version, while codice_1 will invoke an X Window System based interface if possible; however, if codice_1 determines that X Window System capabilities are not present, it will present the text-based version instead of failing. Determination of X Window System capabilities is typically performed by checking for the existence of the codice_12 variable.

Object Data Manager (ODM) is a database of system information integrated into AIX, analogous to the <a href="Windows%20registry">registry</a> in <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. A good understanding of the ODM is essential for managing AIX systems.

Data managed in ODM is stored and maintained as <a href="Object%20%28computer%20science%29">objects</a> with associated <a href="Attribute%20%28computing%29">attributes</a>. Interaction with ODM is possible via <a href="application%20programming%20interface">application programming interface</a> (API) <a href="Library%20%28computing%29">library</a> for programs, and <a href="command-line">command-line</a> utilities such us "odmshow", "odmget", "odmadd", "odmchange" and "odmdelete" for <a href="shell%20script">shell script</a>s and users. <a href="System%20Management%20Interface%20Tool">SMIT</a> and its associated AIX commands can also be used to query and modify information in the ODM.

AppleTalk

AppleTalk was a <a href="proprietary%20protocol">proprietary</a> <a href="protocol%20stack">suite of networking protocols</a> developed by <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a> for their <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Macintosh computers</a>. AppleTalk includes a number of features that allow <a href="local%20area%20network">local area network</a>s to be connected with no prior setup or the need for a centralized router or server of any sort. Connected AppleTalk-equipped systems automatically assign addresses, update the distributed namespace, and configure any required inter-networking routing.

AppleTalk was released in 1985, and was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 1990s. Versions were also released for the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> and compatibles and the <a href="Apple%20IIGS">Apple IIGS</a>. AppleTalk support was also available in most networked printers (especially <a href="laser%20printer">laser printer</a>s), some <a href="file%20server">file server</a>s, and a number of <a href="router%20%28computing%29">router</a>s.

The rise of <a href="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> during the 1990s led to a reimplementation of most of these types of support on that protocol, and AppleTalk became unsupported as of the release of <a href="Mac%20OS%20X%20v10.6">Mac OS X v10.6</a> in 2009. Many of AppleTalk's more advanced autoconfiguration features have since been introduced in <a href="Bonjour%20%28software%29">Bonjour</a>, while <a href="Universal%20Plug%20and%20Play">Universal Plug and Play</a> serves similar needs.

After the release of the <a href="Apple%20Lisa">Apple Lisa</a> computer in January 1983, Apple invested considerable effort in the development of a <a href="local%20area%20networking">local area networking</a> (LAN) system for the machines. Known as AppleNet, it was based on the seminal <a href="Xerox%20XNS">Xerox XNS</a> <a href="protocol%20stack">protocol stack</a> but running on a custom 1 Mbit/s <a href="coaxial%20cable">coaxial cable</a> system rather than Xerox's 2.94 Mbit/s <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a>. AppleNet was announced early in 1983 with a fall introduction at the target price of $500 for plug-in AppleNet cards for the Lisa and the <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>.

At that time, early LAN systems were just coming to market, including <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a>, <a href="Token%20Ring">Token Ring</a> and <a href="ARCNET">ARCNET</a>. This was a topic of major commercial effort at the time, dominating shows like the <a href="National%20Computer%20Conference">National Computer Conference</a> (NCC) in Anaheim in May 1983. All of the systems were jockeying for position in the market, but even at this time Ethernet's widespread acceptance suggested it was to become a "de facto" standard. It was at this show that <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> asked Gursharan Sidhu a seemingly innocuous question, "Why has networking not caught on?"

Four months later, in October, AppleNet was cancelled. At the time, they announced that "Apple realized that it's not in the business to create a networking system. We built and used AppleNet in-house, but we realized that if we had shipped it, we would have seen new standards coming up." In January, Jobs announced that they would instead be supporting <a href="IBM">IBM</a>'s Token Ring, which he expected to come out in a "few months".

Through this period, Apple was deep in development of the Macintosh computer. During development, engineers had made the decision to use the <a href="Zilog%20SCC">Zilog 8530</a> serial controller chip (SCC) instead of the lower cost and more common <a href="UART">UART</a> to provide <a href="serial%20port">serial port</a> connections. The SCC cost about $5 more than a UART, but offered much higher speeds up to 250 kilobits per second (or higher with additional hardware) and internally supported a number of basic networking-like protocols like IBM's <a href="Binary%20Synchronous%20Communications">Bisync</a>.

The SCC was chosen because it would allow multiple devices to be attached to the port. <a href="Peripherals">Peripherals</a> equipped with similar SCCs could communicate using the built-in protocols, interleaving their data with other peripherals on the same bus. This would eliminate the need for more ports on the back of the machine, and allowed for the elimination of <a href="expansion%20slot">expansion slot</a>s for supporting more complex devices. The initial concept was known as AppleBus, envisioning a system controlled by the host Macintosh polling "dumb" devices in a fashion similar to the modern <a href="Universal%20Serial%20Bus">Universal Serial Bus</a>.

The Macintosh team had already begun work on what would become the <a href="LaserWriter">LaserWriter</a>, and had considered a number of other options of how to share these expensive machines and other resources. A series of memos from Bob Belleville clarified these concepts, outlining the Mac, LaserWriter and a <a href="file%20server">file server</a> system which would become <a href="Macintosh%20Office">Macintosh Office</a>. By late 1983 it was clear that IBM's Token Ring would not be ready in time for the launch of the Mac, and might miss the launch of these other products as well. In the end, Token Ring would not ship until October 1985.

Jobs' earlier question to Sidhu had already sparked a number of ideas. When AppleNet was cancelled in October, Sidhu led an effort to develop a new networking system based on the AppleBus hardware. This new system would not have to conform to any existing preconceptions, and was designed to be worthy of the Mac - a system that was user-installable, had zero-configuration, and no fixed network addresses - in short, a true plug-and-play network. Considerable effort was needed, but by the time the Mac was released, the basic concepts had been outlined, and some of the low-level protocols were on their way to completion. Sidhu mentioned the work to Belleville only two hours after the Mac was announced.

The "new" AppleBus was announced in early 1984, allowing direct connection from the Mac or Lisa through a small box that plugged into the serial port and connected via cables to the next computer upstream and downstream. Adaptors for <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a> and <a href="Apple%20III">Apple III</a> were also announced. Apple also announced that AppleBus networks could be attached to, and would appear to be a single node within, a Token Ring system. Details of how this would work were sketchy.

Just prior to its release in early 1985, AppleBus was renamed AppleTalk. The system had a number of limitations, including a speed of only 230.4 kbit/s, a maximum distance of 1000 feet from end to end, and only 32 nodes per LAN. But as the basic hardware was built into the Mac, adding nodes only cost about $50 for the adaptor box. In comparison, Ethernet or Token Ring cards cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Additionally, the entire <a href="networking%20stack">networking stack</a> required only about 6 kB of RAM, allowing it to run on any Mac.

The relatively slow speed of AppleTalk allowed further reductions in cost. Instead of using <a href="RS-422">RS-422</a>'s balanced transmit and receive circuits, the AppleTalk Personal Network cabling used a single common <a href="electrical%20ground">electrical ground</a>, which limited speeds to about 500 kbit/s, but allowed one conductor to be removed. This meant that common three-conductor cables could be used for wiring. Additionally, the adaptors were designed to be "self-terminating", meaning that nodes at the end of the network could simply leave their last connector unconnected. There was no need for the wires to be connected back together into a loop, nor the need for hubs or other devices.

The system was designed for future expansion; the addressing system allowed for expansion to 255 nodes in a LAN (although only 32 could be used at that time), and by using "bridges" (which came to be known as "routers", although technically not the same) one could interconnect LANs into larger collections. "Zones" allowed devices to be addressed within a bridge-connected internet. Additionally, AppleTalk was designed from the start to allow use with any potential underlying physical link.

The main advantage of AppleTalk was that it was completely maintenance-free. To join a device to a network, you simply plugged the adaptor into the machine, then connected a cable from it to any free port on any other adaptor. AppleTalk's internal protocols negotiated a working network address number, automatically gave the computer a human-readable name, and collected up a list of the names and types of other machines on the network so the user could browse the devices through the GUI-based <a href="Chooser%20%28Mac%20OS%29">Chooser</a>. AppleTalk was so easy to use that ad-hoc networks tended to appear whenever multiple Macs were in the same room. Apple would later use this in an advertisement showing a network being created between two seats in an airplane.

A thriving 3rd party market for AppleTalk devices developed over the next few years. One particularly notable example was an alternate adaptor designed by <a href="Berkeley%20Macintosh%20Users%20Group">BMUG</a> and commercialized by Farallon as <a href="PhoneNet">PhoneNet</a> in 1987. This was essentially a replacement for Apple's connector that had conventional <a href="Telephone%20plug">phone jacks</a> instead of Apple's round connectors. PhoneNet allowed AppleTalk networks to be connected together using normal telephone wires, and with very little extra work, could run analog phones and AppleTalk on a single four-conductor phone cable.

Other companies took advantage of the SCC's ability to read external clocks in order to support higher transmission speeds, up to 1 Mbit/s. In these systems the external adaptor also included its own <a href="clock">clock</a>, and used that to signal the SCC's clock input pins. The best known such system was Centram's FlashTalk, which ran at 768 kbit/s, and was intended to be used with their <a href="TOPS%20%28file%20server%29">TOPS</a> networking system. A similar solution was the 850 kbit/s DaynaTalk, which used a separate box that plugged in between the computer and a normal LocalTalk/PhoneNet box. Dayna also offered a PC expansion card that ran up to 1.7 Mbit/s when talking to other Dayna PC cards. Several other systems also existed with even higher performance, but these often required special cabling that was incompatible with LocalTalk/PhoneNet, and also required patches to the networking stack that often caused problems.

By 1987 Ethernet was clearly winning the standards battle over Token Ring, and in the middle of that year Apple introduced EtherTalk 1.0 for the newly released <a href="Macintosh%20II">Macintosh II</a> computer. The package included both a <a href="NuBus">NuBus</a> card with Ethernet ports and a new Network <a href="Control%20panel%20%28Mac%20OS%29">control panel</a> that allowed the user to select which physical connection to use for networking (from "Built-in" or "EtherTalk"). The release's new networking stack also expanded the system to allow a full 255 nodes per LAN. With its release, AppleTalk Personal Network was renamed <a href="LocalTalk">LocalTalk</a>. Token Ring would eventually be supported with the similar TokenTalk product, which used the same Network control panel and underlying software. Many third party companies would introduce compatible Ethernet and Token Ring cards that used these same drivers.

The appearance of EtherTalk also led to a problem: Networks with new and old Macs needed some way to communicate between each other. This could be as simple as a network of Ethernet Mac IIs trying to talk to a LaserWriter. Apple had considered the problem, and AppleTalk included the possibility for a low-cost <a href="LocalTalk-to-Ethernet%20bridge">LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridge</a>, but they felt it would be a low-volume product and left it to third parties. A number of companies responded, both existing communications vendors like <a href="Hayes%20Microcomputer%20Products">Hayes</a> and <a href="Cisco%20Systems">Cisco Systems</a>, as well as newly formed companies like Kinetics. Contrary to Apple's belief these would be low-volume, by the end of 1987, 130,000 such systems were in use. AppleTalk was at that time the most used networking system in the world, with over three times the installations of any other vendor.

1987 also marked the introduction of the <a href="AppleShare">AppleShare</a> product, a dedicated <a href="file%20server">file server</a> that ran on any Mac with 512 kB of <a href="RAM">RAM</a> or more. A common AppleShare machine was the <a href="Mac%20Plus">Mac Plus</a> with an external <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> <a href="hard%20drive">hard drive</a>. AppleShare was the #3 <a href="network%20operating%20system">network operating system</a> in the late 1980s, behind <a href="Novell%20NetWare">Novell NetWare</a> and Microsoft's <a href="MS-Net">MS-Net</a>. AppleShare was effectively the replacement for the failed Macintosh Office efforts, which had been based on a dedicated file server device.

A significant re-design was released in 1989 as AppleTalk Phase II. In many ways, Phase II can be considered an effort to make the earlier version (never called Phase I) more generic. LANs could now support more than 255 nodes, and zones were no longer associated with physical networks, but were entirely virtual constructs used simply to organize nodes. For instance, one could now make a "Printers" zone that would list all the printers in an organization, or one might want to place that same device in the "2nd Floor" zone to indicate its physical location. Phase II also included changes to the underlying inter-networking protocols to make them less "chatty", which had previously been a serious problem on networks that bridged over wide-area networks.

By this point Apple had a wide variety of communications products under development, and many of these were announced along with AppleTalk Phase II. These included updates to EtherTalk and TokenTalk, AppleTalk software and LocalTalk hardware for the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>, EtherTalk for Apple's <a href="A/UX">A/UX</a> <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> allowing it to use LaserPrinters and other network resources, and the Mac X.25 and <a href="MacX">MacX</a> products.

Ethernet had become almost universal by 1990, and it was time to build Ethernet into Macs direct from the factory. However, the physical wiring used by these networks was not yet completely standardized. Apple solved this problem using a single port on the back of the computer into which the user could plug an adaptor for any given cabling system. This FriendlyNet system was based on the industry-standard <a href="Attachment%20Unit%20Interface">Attachment Unit Interface</a> or AUI, but deliberately chose a non-standard connector that was smaller and easier to use, which they called "Apple AUI", or AAUI. FriendlyNet was first introduced on the <a href="Quadra%20700">Quadra 700</a> and <a href="Quadra%20900">Quadra 900</a> computers, and used across much of the Mac line for some time. As with LocalTalk, a number of 3rd party FriendlyNet adaptors quickly appeared.

As <a href="10BASE-T">10BASE-T</a> became the de facto cabling system for Ethernet, second-generation <a href="Power%20Macintosh">Power Macintosh</a> machines added a 10BASE-T port in addition to AAUI. The <a href="PowerBook%203400c">PowerBook 3400c</a> and lower-end Power Macs also added 10BASE-T. The <a href="Power%20Macintosh%207300">Power Macintosh 7300</a>/<a href="Power%20Macintosh%208600">8600</a>/<a href="Power%20Macintosh%209600">9600</a> were the final Macs to include AAUI, and 10BASE-T became universal starting with the <a href="Power%20Macintosh%20G3">Power Macintosh G3</a> and <a href="PowerBook%20G3">PowerBook G3</a>.

In 1988 Apple had released <a href="MacTCP">MacTCP</a>, a system that allowed the Mac to support <a href="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> on machines with suitable Ethernet hardware. However, this left many universities with the problem of supporting IP on their many LocalTalk-equipped Macs. <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> pioneered development of <a href="MacIP">MacIP</a>, which allowed IP packets to be routed over LocalTalk networks with the support of a suitable "gateway" machine. These were initially custom devices, but it was soon common to include MacIP support in LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridges. MacTCP would not become a standard part of the <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Classic Mac OS</a> until 1994, by which time it also supported <a href="SNMP">SNMP</a> and <a href="Point-to-point%20protocol">PPP</a>.

For some time in the early 1990s, the Mac was a primary client on the rapidly expanding Internet. Among the better known programs in wide use were Fetch, Eudora, <a href="eXodus">eXodus</a>, NewsWatcher and the NCSA packages, especially <a href="NCSA%20Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a> and its offspring, <a href="Netscape%20Navigator">Netscape Navigator</a>. Additionally, a number of server products appeared that allowed the Mac to host Internet content. Through this period, Macs had about 2 to 3 times as many clients connected to the Internet as any other platform, despite the relatively small overall marketshare.

As the world quickly moved to IP for both LAN and WAN uses, Apple was faced with maintaining two increasingly outdated code bases on an ever-wider group of machines as well as the introduction of the <a href="PowerPC">PowerPC</a> based machines. This led to the <a href="Open%20Transport">Open Transport</a> efforts, which re-implemented both MacTCP and AppleTalk on an entirely new code base adapted from the Unix standard <a href="STREAMS">STREAMS</a>. Early versions had problems and did not become stable for some time. By that point, Apple was deep in their ultimately doomed <a href="Copland%20%28operating%20system%29">Copland</a> efforts.

With the purchase of <a href="NeXT">NeXT</a> and subsequent development of <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a>, AppleTalk was strictly a legacy system. Support was added to OS X in order to provide support for the large number of existing AppleTalk devices, notably <a href="laser%20printer">laser printer</a>s and file shares, but alternate connection solutions common in this era, notably USB for printers, limited their demand. As Apple abandoned many of these product categories, and all new systems were based on IP, AppleTalk became less and less common. AppleTalk support was finally removed from the MacOS in <a href="Mac%20OS%20X%20v10.6">Mac OS X v10.6</a> in 2009.

However, the loss of AppleTalk did not reduce the desire for networking solutions that combined its ease-of-use with IP routing. Apple has led development of many such efforts, from the introduction of the <a href="AirPort">AirPort</a> router to the development of the <a href="Zero%20configuration%20networking">Zero configuration networking</a> system and their implementation of it, <a href="Bonjour%20%28software%29">Bonjour</a>.

The AppleTalk design rigorously followed the <a href="OSI%20model">OSI model</a> of protocol layering. Unlike most of the early <a href="local%20area%20network">LAN</a> systems, AppleTalk was not built using the archetypal <a href="Xerox%20XNS">Xerox XNS</a> system. The intended target was not Ethernet, and it did not have 48-bit addresses to route. Nevertheless, many portions of the AppleTalk system have direct analogs in XNS.

One key differentiation for AppleTalk was it contained two protocols aimed at making the system completely self-configuring. The "AppleTalk address resolution protocol" ("AARP") allowed AppleTalk hosts to automatically generate their own network addresses, and the "Name Binding Protocol" ("NBP") was a dynamic system for mapping network addresses to user-readable names. Although systems similar to AARP existed in other systems, <a href="Banyan%20VINES">Banyan VINES</a> for instance, nothing like NBP has existed until recently.

Both AARP and NBP had defined ways to allow "controller" devices to override the default mechanisms. The concept was to allow routers to provide the information or "hardwire" the system to known addresses and names. On larger networks where AARP could cause problems as new nodes searched for free addresses, the addition of a router could reduce "chattiness." Together AARP and NBP made AppleTalk an easy-to-use networking system. New machines were added to the network by plugging them and optionally giving them a name. The NBP lists were examined and displayed by a program known as the "<a href="Apple%20Chooser">Chooser</a>" which would display a list of machines on the local network, divided into classes such as file-servers and printers.

An AppleTalk address was a 4-byte quantity. This consisted of a two-byte network number, a one-byte node number, and a one-byte socket number. Of these, only the network number required any configuration, being obtained from a router. Each node dynamically chose its own node number, according to a protocol (originally the LocalTalk Link Access Protocol LLAP and later the AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol, AARP) which handled contention between different nodes accidentally choosing the same number. For socket numbers, a few well-known numbers were reserved for special purposes specific to the AppleTalk protocol itself. Apart from these, all application-level protocols were expected to use dynamically-assigned socket numbers at both the client and server end.

Because of this dynamism, users could not be expected to access services by specifying their address. Instead, all services had "names" which, being chosen by humans, could be expected to be meaningful to users, and also could be sufficiently long to minimize the chance of conflicts.

As NBP names translated to an address, which included a socket number as well as a node number, a name in AppleTalk mapped directly to a "service" being provided by a machine, which was entirely separate from the name of the machine itself. Thus, services could be moved to a different machine and, so long as they kept the same service name, there was no need for users to do anything different in order to continue accessing the service. And the same machine could host any number of instances of services of the same type, without any network connection conflicts.

Contrast this with "A records" in the <a href="Domain%20Name%20System">DNS</a>, where a name translates to a machine's address, not including the port number that might be providing a service. Thus, if people are accustomed to using a particular machine name to access a particular service, their access will break when the service is moved to a different machine. This can be mitigated somewhat by insistence on using "CNAME records" indicating service rather than actual machine names to refer to the service, but there is no way of guaranteeing that users will follow such a convention. Some newer protocols, such as <a href="Kerberos%20%28protocol%29">Kerberos</a> and <a href="Active%20Directory">Active Directory</a> use DNS <a href="SRV%20record">SRV record</a>s to identify services by name, which is much closer to the AppleTalk model.

AARP resolves AppleTalk addresses to <a href="link%20layer">link layer</a>, usually <a href="MAC%20address">MAC</a>, addresses. It is functionally equivalent to <a href="Address%20resolution%20protocol">ARP</a>.

AARP is a fairly simple system. When powered on, an AppleTalk machine broadcasts an "AARP probe packet" asking for a network address, intending to hear back from controllers such as routers. If no address is provided, one is picked at random from the "base subnet", 0. It then broadcasts another packet saying "I am selecting this address", and then waits to see if anyone else on the network complains. If another machine has that address, it will pick another address, and keep trying until it finds a free one. On a network with many machines it may take several tries before a free address is found, so for performance purposes the successful address is "written down" in <a href="NVRAM">NVRAM</a> and used as the default address in the future. This means that in most real-world setups where machines are added a few at a time, only one or two tries are needed before the address effectively become constant.

This was a comparatively late addition to the AppleTalk protocol suite, done when it became clear that a <a href="Transmission%20Control%20Protocol">TCP</a>-style reliable connection-oriented transport was needed. Significant differences from TCP were:

The <a href="Apple%20Filing%20Protocol">Apple Filing Protocol</a> (AFP), formerly AppleTalk Filing Protocol, is the protocol for communicating with <a href="AppleShare">AppleShare</a> file servers. Built on top of AppleTalk Session Protocol (for legacy AFP over DDP) or the <a href="Data%20Stream%20Interface">Data Stream Interface</a> (for AFP over TCP), it provides services for authenticating users (extensible to different authentication methods including two-way random-number exchange) and for performing operations specific to the Macintosh <a href="Hierarchical%20File%20System">HFS</a> filesystem. AFP is still in use in macOS, even though most other AppleTalk protocols have been deprecated.

ASP was an intermediate protocol, built on top of ATP, which in turn was the foundation of AFP. It provided basic services for requesting responses to arbitrary "commands" d performing out-of-band status queries. It also allowed the server to send asynchronous "attention" messages to the client.

DDP was the lowest-level data-link-independent transport protocol. It provided a <a href="datagram">datagram</a> service with no guarantees of delivery. All application-level protocols, including the infrastructure protocols NBP, RTMP and ZIP, were built on top of DDP. AppleTalk's DDP corresponds closely to the Network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (<a href="OSI%20model">OSI</a>) communication model.

Name Binding Protocol was a dynamic, distributed system for managing AppleTalk names. When a service started up on a machine, it registered a name for itself as chosen by a human administrator. At this point, NBP provided a system for checking that no other machine had already registered the same name. Later, when a client wanted to access that service, it used NBP to query machines to find that service. NBP provided browseability ("what are the names of all the services available?") as well as the ability to find a service with a particular name. Names were human readable, containing spaces, upper and lower case letters, and including support for searching.

AEP (AppleTalk Echo Protocol) is a transport layer protocol designed to test the reachability of network nodes. AEP generates packets to be sent to the network node and is identified in the Type field of a packet as an AEP packet. The packet is first passed to the source DDP. After it is identified as an AEP packet, it is forwarded to the node where the packet is examined by the DDP at the destination. After the packet is identified as an AEP packet, the packet is then copied and a field in the packet is altered to create an AEP reply packet, and is then returned to the source node.

PAP was the standard way of communicating with <a href="PostScript">PostScript</a> printers. It was built on top of ATP. When a PAP connection was opened, each end sent the other an ATP request which basically meant "send me more data". The client's response to the server was to send a block of PostScript code, while the server could respond with any diagnostic messages that might be generated as a result, after which another "send-more-data" request was sent. This use of ATP provided automatic <a href="flow%20control%20%28data%29">flow control</a>; each end could only send data to the other end if there was an outstanding ATP request to respond to.

PAP also provided for out-of-band status queries, handled by separate ATP transactions. Even while it was busy servicing a print job from one client, a PAP server could continue to respond to status requests from any number of other clients. This allowed other Macintoshes on the LAN that were waiting to print to display status messages indicating that the printer was busy, and what the job was that it was busy with.

RTMP was the protocol by which routers kept each other informed about the topology of the network. This was the only part of AppleTalk that required periodic unsolicited broadcasts: every 10 seconds, each router had to send out a list of all the network numbers it knew about and how far away it thought they were.

ZIP was the protocol by which AppleTalk network numbers were associated with zone names. A "zone" was a subdivision of the network that made sense to humans (for example, "Accounting Department"); but while a network number had to be assigned to a topologically-contiguous section of the network, a zone could include several different discontiguous portions of the network.

The initial default hardware implementation for AppleTalk was a high-speed serial protocol known as "<a href="LocalTalk">LocalTalk</a>" that used the <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Macintosh</a>'s built-in <a href="RS-422">RS-422</a> ports at 230.4 kbit/s. LocalTalk used a splitter box in the RS-422 port to provide an upstream and downstream cable from a single port. The topology was a <a href="Bus%20network">bus</a>: cables were daisy-chained from each connected machine to the next, up to the maximum of 32 permitted on any <a href="LocalTalk">LocalTalk</a> segment. The system was slow by today's standards, but at the time the additional cost and complexity of networking on PC machines was such that it was common that Macs were the only networked personal computers in an office. Other larger computers, such as UNIX or VAX workstations, would commonly be networked via Ethernet.

Other physical implementations were also available. One common replacement for LocalTalk was "<a href="PhoneNet">PhoneNet</a>", a 3rd party solution (from a company called Farallon, now called <a href="Netopia">Netopia</a>, acquired by <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> in 2007) that also used the RS-422 port and was indistinguishable from LocalTalk as far as Apple's LocalTalk port drivers were concerned, but ran over the two unused wires in standard four-wire phone cabling. PhoneNet was considerably less expensive to install and maintain. Ethernet and <a href="Token%20Ring">Token Ring</a> was also supported, known as "EtherTalk" and "TokenTalk" respectively. EtherTalk in particular gradually became the dominant implementation method for AppleTalk as Ethernet became generally popular in the PC industry throughout the 1990s. Besides AppleTalk and <a href="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a>, any Ethernet network could also simultaneously carry other protocols such as <a href="DECnet">DECnet</a> and <a href="IPX">IPX</a>.

When AppleTalk was first introduced, the dominant office computing platform was the PC compatible running MS-DOS. Apple introduced the AppleTalk PC Card in early 1987, allowing PCs to join AppleTalk networks and print to LaserWriter printers. A year later AppleShare PC was released, allowing PCs to access AppleShare file servers.

The "TOPS Teleconnector" MS-DOS networking system over AppleTalk system enabled MS-DOS PCs to communicate over AppleTalk network hardware; it comprised an AppleTalk interface card for the PC and a suite of networking software allowing such functions as file, drive and printer sharing. As well as allowing the construction of a PC-only AppleTalk network, it allowed communication between PCs and Macs with TOPS software installed. (Macs without TOPS installed could use the same network but only to communicate with other Apple machines.) The Mac TOPS software did not match the quality of Apple's own either in ease of use or in robustness and freedom from crashes, but the DOS software was relatively simple to use in DOS terms, and was robust.

The <a href="BSD">BSD</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a> operating systems support AppleTalk through an open source project called <a href="Netatalk">Netatalk</a>, which implements the complete protocol suite and allows them to both act as native file or print servers for Macintosh computers, and print to LocalTalk printers over the network.

The <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> Server operating systems supported AppleTalk starting with <a href="Windows%20NT">Windows NT</a> and ending after <a href="Windows%20Server%202003">Windows Server 2003</a>. Miramar included AppleTalk in its PC MacLAN product which was discontinued by CA in 2007. <a href="GroupLogic">GroupLogic</a> continues to bundle its AppleTalk protocol with its <a href="ExtremeZ-IP">ExtremeZ-IP</a> server software for Macintosh-Windows integration which supports <a href="Windows%202008%20Server">Windows 2008 Server</a> and <a href="Windows%20Vista">Windows Vista</a> as well prior versions. <a href="http%3A//www.helios.com">HELIOS Software GmbH</a> offers a proprietary implementation of the AppleTalk protocol stack, as part of their HELIOS UB2 server. This is essentially a File and Print Server suite that runs on a whole range of different platforms.

In addition, Columbia University released the Columbia AppleTalk Package (CAP) which implemented the protocol suite for various Unix flavors including <a href="Ultrix">Ultrix</a>, <a href="SunOS">SunOS</a>, *<a href="BSD">BSD</a> and <a href="IRIX">IRIX</a>. This package is no longer actively maintained.

Apple II series

The Apple II series (trademarked with square brackets as "Apple ][" and rendered on later models as "Apple //") is a family of <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>s, one of the first highly successful mass-produced text command <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a> products, designed primarily by <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, manufactured by Apple Computer (now <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a>) and introduced in 1977 with the <a href="Apple%20II">original Apple II</a>. In terms of ease of use, features and expandability, the Apple II was a major technological advancement over its predecessor, the <a href="Apple%20I">Apple I</a>, a limited-production bare <a href="Printed%20circuit%20board">circuit board</a> computer for electronics hobbyists that pioneered many features that made the Apple II a commercial success. Introduced at the <a href="West%20Coast%20Computer%20Faire">West Coast Computer Faire</a> on April 16, 1977, the Apple II was among the first successful personal computers; it launched the Apple company into a successful business (and allowed several related companies to start). Throughout the years, a number of models were sold, with the most popular model remaining relatively little changed into the 1990s. While primarily an 8-bit computer, by mid-run a 16-bit model was introduced.

It was first sold on June 10, 1977. By the end of production in 1993, somewhere between five and six million Apple II series computers (including about 1.25 million Apple II models) had been produced. The Apple II was one of the longest running mass-produced home computer series, with models in production just under 17 years.

The Apple II became one of several recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s, although this was mainly limited to the USA. It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in American secondary schools, displacing the early leader <a href="Commodore%20PET">Commodore PET</a>. The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II, including the 1979 release of the popular <a href="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a> <a href="spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a>, made the computer especially popular with business users and families.

The original Apple II <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> was in <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a> along with <a href="Integer%20BASIC">Integer BASIC</a>. Programs were entered, then saved and loaded on cassette tape. When the <a href="Disk%20II">Disk II</a> was implemented in 1978 by Steve Wozniak, a Disk Operating System or DOS was commissioned from the company Shepardson where its development was done by Paul Laughton. The final and most popular version of this software was <a href="Apple%20DOS">Apple DOS</a> 3.3. Some commercial Apple II software booted directly and did not use standard DOS formats. This discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks and improved loading speed. Apple DOS was superseded by <a href="Apple%20ProDOS">ProDOS</a>, which supported a hierarchical filesystem and larger storage devices. With an optional third-party <a href="Zilog%20Z80">Z80</a>-based <a href="expansion%20card">expansion card</a> the Apple II could boot into the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system and run <a href="WordStar">WordStar</a>, <a href="dBase">dBase II</a>, and other CP/M software. At the height of its evolution, towards the late 1980s, the platform had the graphical look of a hybrid of the Apple II and <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> with the introduction of the Apple II. By 1992, the platform had <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> processing capabilities, a mouse-driven <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a>, and graphics and sound capabilities far beyond the original.

Despite the introduction of the Motorola 68000-based <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> in 1984 the Apple II series still reportedly accounted for 85% of the company's sales in the first quarter of fiscal 1985. Apple continued to sell Apple II systems alongside the Macintosh until terminating the II in December 1992 and the IIe in November 1993. The last II-series Apple in production, the IIe card for Macintoshes, was discontinued on October 15, 1993. Total Apple II sales for its 14-year run were about 6 million units, with the peak occurring in 1983 when 1 million were sold.

The Apple II was designed to look more like a <a href="Small%20appliance">home appliance</a> than a piece of electronic equipment. The lid popped off the beige plastic case without the use of tools, allowing access to the computer's internals, including the <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a> with eight <a href="expansion%20slot">expansion slot</a>s, and an array of random access memory (RAM) sockets that could hold up to 48 <a href="kilobyte">kilobyte</a>s worth of memory chips.

The Apple II had color and high-resolution <a href="Apple%20II%20graphics">graphics modes</a>, sound capabilities and one of two built-in <a href="BASIC">BASIC</a> programming languages (initially <a href="Integer%20BASIC">Integer BASIC</a>, later <a href="Applesoft%20BASIC">Applesoft BASIC</a>). The Apple II was targeted for the masses rather than just hobbyists and engineers; it also influenced most of the microcomputers that followed it. Unlike preceding home microcomputers, it was sold as a finished consumer appliance rather than as a kit (unassembled or preassembled). "VanLOVEs Apple Handbook" and "The Apple Educators Guide" by Gerald VanDiver and Rolland Love reviewed more than 1,500 software programs that the Apple II series could use. The Apple dealer network used this book to emphasize the growing software developer base in education and personal use. 

The Apple II series had a keyboard built into the motherboard shell, with the exception of the <a href="Apple%20IIGS">Apple II</a> which featured an external keyboard. An upgrade kit was sold later to house the motherboard of an Apple II in an <a href="Apple%20IIe">Apple IIe</a> case. The Apple II case was durable enough, according to a 1981 Apple ad, to protect an Apple II from a fire started when a <a href="cat">cat</a> belonging to one early user knocked over a lamp.

Early II-series models were usually designated "Apple ]["; later models "Apple //", plus a letter suffix.

The first Apple II computers went on sale on June 10, 1977 with a <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">MOS Technology 6502</a> (later <a href="Synertek">Synertek</a>) microprocessor running at 1.023 <a href="Hertz">MHz</a>, 4 KB of <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a>, an <a href="compact%20audio%20cassette%23Data%20recording">audio cassette</a> interface for loading programs and storing data, and the <a href="Integer%20BASIC">Integer BASIC</a> programming language built into the <a href="read-only%20memory">ROMs</a>. The video controller displayed 40 columns by 24 lines of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with <a href="National%20Television%20System%20Committee">NTSC</a> <a href="composite%20video">composite video</a> output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate <a href="RF%20modulator">RF modulator</a>. The original retail price of the computer was US$1298(with 4 kB of RAM) and US$2638 (with the maximum 48 kB of RAM). To reflect the computer's <a href="Apple%20II%20graphics">color graphics</a> capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. The earliest Apple IIs were assembled in <a href="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, and later in Texas; <a href="printed%20circuit%20board">printed circuit board</a>s were manufactured in Ireland and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>.

An external 5¼-inch <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a> drive, the <a href="Disk%20II">Disk II</a>, attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components. While other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic pulses, Wozniak's controller card had few chips; instead, the <a href="Apple%20DOS">Apple DOS</a> used software to perform these functions. The <a href="Group%20Coded%20Recording">Group Coded Recording</a> used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common <a href="Modified%20Frequency%20Modulation">MFM</a>. In the end, the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers. As a side effect, Wozniak's scheme made it easy for <a href="proprietary%20software">proprietary software</a> developers to <a href="copy%20protection">copy-protect</a> the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection. Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart's Track-0 sensor. When the Operating System wants to go to track 0, the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next-lower-numbered track, relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0. This process, called "recalibration", made a loud buzzing (rapid mechanical chattering) sound that often frightened Apple novices.

The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's design sensibility. The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.

The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for sub-pixel <a href="font">font</a> rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel-width further to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.

Color on the Apple II series took advantage of a quirk of the <a href="National%20Television%20System%20Committee">NTSC</a> television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was tacked on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by B&W TV sets. Color is encoded based on the "<a href="phase%20%28waves%29">phase</a>" of this signal in relation to a reference "<a href="color%20burst">color burst</a>" signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into "<a href="pixel">pixel</a>s" on the computer screen.

The Apple II display provided two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal was turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the colorburst signal. The high-resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle. The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode worked differently, as it could output a short burst of high-frequency signal per pixel to offer more color options.

The epitome of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry. Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip (though with eight expansion slots, users could add sound functionality with various <a href="Apple%20II%20sound%20cards">sound cards</a>). Similar techniques were used for cassette storage: the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple <a href="Zero%20crossing%20threshold%20detector">zero-crossing detector</a> that served as a crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in <a href="frequency-shift%20keying">frequency-shift keying</a> for the cassette. Since the Apple II mainboard had no interrupts, it was impossible to use the speaker without taking CPU time and so most games had little sound.

Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including <a href="Apple%20II%20peripheral%20cards">Apple II peripheral cards</a> such as <a href="Apple%20II%20serial%20cards">serial controllers</a>, display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and <a href="Apple%20II%20system%20clocks">realtime clocks</a>. There were plug-in <a href="Apple%20II%20processor%20cards">expansion cards</a> – such as the <a href="Z-80%20SoftCard">Z-80 SoftCard</a> – that permitted the Apple to use the <a href="Zilog%20Z80">Z80</a> processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system, including the <a href="dBase">dBase II</a> database and the <a href="WordStar">WordStar</a> word processor. There was also a third-party <a href="Motorola%206809">6809</a> card that would allow <a href="OS-9">OS-9</a> Level One to be run. Third-party <a href="Apple%20II%20sound%20cards">sound cards</a> greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. Eventually, <a href="Apple%20II%20accelerators">Apple II accelerator cards</a> were created to double or quadruple the computer's speed.

<a href="Rod%20Holt">Rod Holt</a> is credited (for example in the <a href="Walter%20Isaacson">Walter Isaacson</a> biography of "Jobs") with the design of the Apple II's power supply. He employed a <a href="Switched-mode%20power%20supply">Switched-mode power supply</a> design. This was far smaller and generated less unwanted heat than the <a href="linear%20power%20supply">linear power supply</a> some other home computers used. Isaacson quotes Wozniak saying that this was not something he could have done; "I only knew vaguely what a switching power supply was."

The original Apple II was discontinued at the start of 1981, having been superseded by the II+. An estimated 40,000 machines were sold for its 4-year production run.

The Apple II Plus, introduced in June 1979, included the <a href="Applesoft%20BASIC">Applesoft BASIC</a> programming language in <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a>. This <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic, and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC).

Except for improved graphics and disk-booting support in the ROM, and the removal of the 2k 6502 assembler/disassembler to make room for the floating point BASIC, the II+ was otherwise identical to the original II. RAM prices fell during 1980–81 and all II+ machines came from the factory with a full 48k of memory already installed. The language card in Slot 0 added another 16k, but it had to be <a href="bank%20switch">bank switch</a>ed since the remaining CPU address space was occupied by the ROMs and I/O area. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The language card was also required to use the <a href="UCSD%20Pascal">UCSD Pascal</a> and <a href="FORTRAN">FORTRAN 77</a> compilers, which were released by Apple at about the same time. These ran under the <a href="UCSD%20Pascal">UCSD p-System</a> operating system, which had its own disk format and emitted code for a "virtual machine" rather than the actual 6502 processor.

A <a href="TEMPEST">TEMPEST</a>-approved version of the Apple II Plus was created in 1980 by the <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Research%20Institute">Georgia Tech Research Institute</a> for <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> <a href="FORSCOM">FORSCOM</a>, and used as a component in the earliest versions of the Microfix system. Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using video disk (<a href="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a>) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as <a href="order%20of%20battle">order of battle</a>, airfields, roadways, and bridges.

After the success of the first Apple II in the United States, Apple expanded its market to include Europe, Australia and the Far East in 1979, with the Apple II Europlus (Europe, Australia) and the Apple II J-Plus (Japan). In these models, Apple made the necessary hardware, software and <a href="firmware">firmware</a> changes in order to comply to standards outside of the U.S. The <a href="power%20supply">power supply</a> was modified to accept the local voltage, and in the European and Australian model the video output signal was changed from color <a href="National%20Television%20System%20Committee">NTSC</a> to monochrome <a href="Phase%20Alternating%20Line">PAL</a> – an extra video card was needed for color PAL graphics, since the simple tricks Wozniak had used to generate a pseudo-NTSC signal with minimal hardware did not carry over to the more complex PAL system. In the Japanese version of the international Apple, the keyboard layout was changed to allow for <a href="Katakana">Katakana</a> writing (full <a href="Kanji">Kanji</a> support was clearly beyond the capabilities of the machine), but in most other countries the international Apple was sold with an unmodified American keyboard; thus the German model still lacked the <a href="Umlaut%20%28diacritic%29">umlauts</a>, for example. For the most part, the Apple II Europlus and J-Plus were identical to the Apple II Plus. Production of the Europlus ended in 1983.

The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the <a href="Apple%20IIe">Apple IIe</a>, a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64 kB of RAM.

The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48 kB Apple II Plus with a language card; the machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that for most practical purposes took the place of slot 3, the most commonly used slot for 80-column cards in the II Plus.

The auxiliary slot could accept a 1 kB memory card to enable the 80-column display. This card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe, remaining fairly compatible with the older Videx-style cards, even though the low-level details were very different. An "extended 80-column card" with more memory expanded the machine's RAM to 128 kB.

As with the language card, the memory in the 80-column card was bank-switched over the machine's main RAM; this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software, and in fact the <a href="Apple%20ProDOS">ProDOS</a> operating system, which was introduced with the Apple IIe, would automatically configure this memory as a <a href="RAM%20disk">RAM disk</a> upon booting.

Third-party aux-slot memory cards later allowed expansion up to 1 <a href="megabyte">MB</a>. The 80-column card also enabled one new graphics mode, Double Lo-Res (80×48 pixels). The extended 80-column card enabled two, Double Lo-Res and Double Hi-Res (560×192 pixels). Both modes doubled the horizontal resolution in comparison to the standard Lo-Res (40×48) and Hi-Res (280×192) Modes; in the case of Double Hi-Res, the number of available colors was increased as well, from 6 to 15. Apple IIes from the very first production run could not use Double Hi-Res. Neither of these modes was directly supported by the built-in BASIC, however, so the user had to resort to the use of lots of POKE and CALL commands in BASIC, or assembly language programming, or one of a number of software Toolkits to exploit these modes.

While it was possible for software to switch out the 80-column firmware, making the firmware of a card in slot 3 available with a card in the auxiliary slot, it was not a common thing to do. However, even with the 80-column firmware enabled, slot 3's I/O memory range was still usable, giving it approximately the capability of slot 0 on a II or II plus. This meant that it actually was possible to use slot 3 for things, such as coprocessor cards and language cards, that did not use slot firmware space.

Introduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk, essentially two Disk II 5.25-inch drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor, and a new controller card to run it. This controller was (by design) functionally identical to the original Disk II controller but used a different connector, allowing a single cable to control both drives in the DuoDisk. The DuoDisk was plagued by reliability problems, however, and did not catch on as well as the Apple IIe itself.

The Apple IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the "workhorse" of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time – it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly 11 years. In that time, following the original, two important variations were introduced known as the <a href="Apple%20IIe%23The%20Enhanced%20IIe">Apple IIe Enhanced</a> (four new replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model <a href="Apple%20IIc">Apple IIc</a>, including an upgraded processor called the 65C02) and the <a href="Apple%20IIe%20Platinum">Apple IIe Platinum</a> (a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in <a href="numeric%20keypad">numeric keypad</a>). An Enhanced IIe with 128 kB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988. IIe models were distinguished from the standard IIe by having 128k of memory, double hi-resolution graphics, and a 65C02 CPU.

Two and a half years before the Apple IIe, Apple produced and unsuccessfully marketed a computer called the "<a href="Apple%20III">Apple III</a>" for business users. Some of its features were carried over in the design of the Apple IIe. Among them was the ProDOS operating system, which was based on Apple III's <a href="Sophisticated%20Operating%20System">Sophisticated Operating System</a> (SOS).

Apple released the <a href="Apple%20IIc">Apple IIc</a> in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II, because it could be easily carried, though unlike modern <a href="portable%20computer">portables</a> it lacked a built-in display and battery. The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the <a href="Snow%20White%20design%20language">Snow White design language</a>, and the only one that used its unique creamy off-white color. (The other Snow White computers from the Apple II series, the II and the IIc Plus, were light gray, called "Platinum" by Apple.) The obsolete cassette port was omitted from the IIc.

The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the <a href="WDC%2065C02">65C02</a> low-power variant of the 6502 processor, and featured a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive and 128 kB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1 MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1 MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5.25-inch floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3½-inch disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.

IIc machines supported the 16-color double hi-resolution graphics mode and from a software standpoint were identical to the IIe.

Two different monochrome <a href="Liquid-crystal%20display">LCD</a> displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12 V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter.

The Apple IIc (in its American version) was the first microcomputer to include support for the <a href="Dvorak%20Simplified%20Keyboard">Dvorak Simplified Keyboard</a>, which was activated using a switch above the keyboard. This feature was also later found in late-model American Apple IIe computers (though the switch was inside the computer) and in the Apple II (accessible via the built-in control panel). The international models used the same mechanism to switch between the localized and the American keyboard layouts, but did not offer Dvorak.

The next member of the line was the <a href="Apple%20IIGS">Apple II</a> computer, released on September 15, 1986. A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the II featured a true <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> microprocessor, the <a href="WDC%2065816/65802">65C816</a>, operating at with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8 MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines (RAM cards with more than 4 MB were never directly supported by Apple). It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions with a palette of 4,096 colors and up to 256 colors on screen; however, only 4 (at 640×200 resolution) or 16 (at 320×200 resolution) colors could be used on a single line at a time.

In a departure from earlier Apple II graphics modes, the new modes laid out the scanlines sequentially in memory and up to 16 scanline changes could be made (i.e. 16 palettes of 16 distinct colors each, equals 256 colors) without slowing down the CPU. However, programmers in search of a graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping in a different 16-color palette for each of the screen's 200 scanlines as the monitor's electron beam traced the screen line by line. This exotic technique did not leave many CPU cycles available for other processing, so this "mode" was best suited to displaying static images.

The Apple II stood out from any previous (or future) Apple II models, evolving and advancing the platform into the next generation of computing while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The secret of the Apple II's compatibility was a single chip called the <a href="Mega%20II">Mega II</a>, which contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor). This, combined with the flawless 65C02 emulation mode of the 65C816 processor, provided full support for legacy software.

The computer also included a 32-voice <a href="Ensoniq%205503%20DOC">Ensoniq 5503 DOC</a> '<a href="Table-lookup%20synthesis">wavetable</a>' <a href="sample-based%20synthesis">sample-based sound synthesizer</a> chip with 64 kB dedicated RAM, 256 kB (or later 1.125 MB) of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices), built-in <a href="AppleTalk">AppleTalk</a> networking, and a ROM toolbox that supported a graphical user interface derived from the Macintosh toolbox. The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new (albeit modified) OS called ProDOS 16 and later replaced by a full 16-bit OS called GS/OS. The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories – just like the Macintosh. The 16-bit operating system would automatically switch to the text display and downshift to 8-bit mode to run legacy software, while offering a consistent, Macintosh-like graphical interface for native 16-bit applications. Eventually, the II gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, even multitasking (both cooperative and preemptive, the latter in the form of a Unix-type shell), outline TrueType font support, and in one case, even real-time 3D gaming using texture mapping.

The first 50,000 Apple II computers came with Steve Wozniak's ""Woz"" signature silkscreened on the front and were referred to as the ""Woz Limited Edition"". These machines are not functionally different from machines from the same time period without the signature.

The final Apple II model was the <a href="Apple%20IIc%20Plus">Apple IIc Plus</a> introduced in 1988. It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5.25-inch floppy drive had been replaced with a 3½-inch drive, the power supply was moved inside (gone was the IIc's external power brick), and the processor was a fast 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II. (Third-party accelerators for other models could, however, go as fast as , and II accelerators would eventually reach .) The IIc Plus's accelerator was derived from a design licensed from Zip Technologies, a third-party maker of accelerators for the Apple II, though Apple used separate chips instead of combining the processor, cache, and supporting logic on a multi-chip module as did Zip. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughter-card carrying up to a <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a> of RAM. The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II. Unlike the IIe, IIc and II, the IIc Plus came only in one version (American) and was not officially sold anywhere outside the USA.

Many perceived the IIc Plus as Apple's attempt to compete with the <a href="Laser%20128">Laser 128EX/2</a>, a popular third party Apple-compatible machine that also had an accelerated processor and a built-in 3.5-inch drive. There were few other rational explanations for Apple expending resources on the continued development of a new 8-bit Apple II model rather than furthering the 16-bit Apple II. However, with its 3.5-inch drive and speedy processor, it provided a compact machine for running the <a href="AppleWorks">AppleWorks</a> integrated productivity package, especially with the 1 MB memory upgrade.

Although not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the <a href="Apple%20IIe%20Card">Apple IIe Card</a>, an expansion card for the <a href="Macintosh%20LC">LC</a> line of <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers, was released. Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (using the Mega II chip from the Apple II), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through <a href="hardware%20emulation">hardware emulation</a> (although video was emulated in software and was slower at times than a IIe). Many of the LC's built-in Macintosh peripherals could be "borrowed" by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3.5-inch floppy, AppleTalk networking, hard disk). The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II. The Macintosh LC with IIe Card was intended to replace the Apple II in schools and homes and was presumably the reason a new model Apple II that was confirmed by insiders to be in development at one point was cancelled and never released.

<a href="Mike%20Markkula">Mike Markkula</a>, a retired <a href="Intel">Intel</a> marketing manager, provided the early critical funding for Apple Computer. From 1977 to 1981, Apple used the <a href="Regis%20McKenna">Regis McKenna</a> agency for its advertisements and marketing. In 1981, <a href="Chiat/Day">Chiat-Day</a> acquired Regis McKenna's advertising operations and Apple used Chiat-Day. At Regis McKenna Advertising, the team assigned to launch the Apple II consisted of <a href="Rob%20Janoff">Rob Janoff</a>, art director, Chip Schafer, copywriter and Bill Kelley, account executive. Janoff came up with the Apple logo with a bite out of it. The design was originally an olive green with matching company logotype all in lower case. <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> insisted on promoting the color capability of the Apple II by putting rainbow stripes on the Apple logo. In its letterhead and business card implementation, the rounded "a" of the logotype echoed the "bite" in the logo. This logo was developed simultaneously with an advertisement and a brochure; the latter being produced for distribution initially at the first <a href="West%20Coast%20Computer%20Faire">West Coast Computer Faire</a>. Ever since the original Apple II, Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging, partly because of <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>' personal preferences and opinions on packaging and final product appearance. All of Apple's packaging for the Apple II series looked similar, featuring lots of clean white space and showing the Apple rainbow logo prominently. For several years up until the late 1980s, Apple used the <a href="Apple%20typography%23Motter%20Tektura">Motter Tektura</a> font for packaging, until changing to the <a href="Typography%20and%20logography%20of%20Apple%20Computer%23Apple%20Garamond">Apple Garamond</a> font.

Apple ran the first advertisement for the Apple II, a two-page spread ad titled "Introducing Apple II", in "<a href="BYTE">BYTE</a>" in July 1977. The first brochure, was entitled "Simplicity" and the copy in both the ad and brochure pioneered "demystifying" language intended to make the new idea of a home computer more "personal." The Apple II introduction ad was later run in the September 1977 issue of "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>".

For the Apple IIc, Apple wanted an advertisement to demonstrate the power of the machine despite its small size; they ran a memorable television commercial featuring a high-rise office building in which they claimed with words and images that the IIc had all the power necessary to run a large building, suggesting that it had more than enough power for the home user. (This ad, along with the "1984" Macintosh ad, was featured in a Marketing telecourse run on PBS.)

Apple later aired eight television commercials for the Apple II, emphasizing its benefits to education and students, along with some print ads.

Towards the end of 1982, art director Brent Thomas and Steve Hayden came up with the idea of doing an <a href="advertising%20campaign">advertising campaign</a> based on the timely tagline "Why 1984 will not be like 1984". Chiat-Day shopped it around to a number of clients, including Apple, where it was proposed to be used for a print ad in <a href="the%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">the Wall Street Journal</a> promoting the Apple II. However, Apple did not go for it, and the idea was filed away until the spring of 1983, when they met with the Macintosh marketing team to start working on the launch, which was scheduled for January 1984. The idea eventually became the famous "<a href="1984%20%28advertisement%29">1984</a>" commercial which aired during the third quarter at <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XVIII">Super Bowl XVIII</a>.

The Apple II was frequently cloned, both in the United States and abroad and similar cloning of the IBM PC later occurred. According to some sources (see below), more than 190 different models of <a href="List%20of%20Apple%20II%20clones">Apple II clones</a> were manufactured. Most could not be legally imported into the United States; <a href="United%20States%20Customs">United States Customs</a> might confiscate even a clone purchased in Asia and brought into the country as luggage. Apple sued and sought criminal charges against clone makers in more than a dozen countries, and cooperated with the agency in investigations. For example, in December 1983 raids on three separate importers, customs confiscated about 400 clones of the discontinued Apple II that investigators purchased for $375–500.

Without explicitly stating that they were Apple II clones, many had fruit-related names. An example was the Pineapple, and) that a review of the <a href="ACT%20Apricot">ACT Apricot</a> explained that it was not "yet another 'fruity' Apple rip-off". Apple successfully forced the "Pineapple" to change its name to "Pinecom".
<a href="Agat%20computer">Agat</a> was a series of Apple II compatible computers produced in <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> between 1984 and 1993. They were widely used in schools in 80's. First mass-produced models Agat 4 and Agat 7 had different memory layouts and video modes to Apple II, which made first Agats only partially compatible. Agats were not direct clones of Apple II, but rather uniquely designed computers based on 6502 CPU and emulated Apple II architecture. That helped developers to port Apple II software titles to Agat. Later model Agat 9 had Apple II compatibility mode out of the box. Soviet engineers and enthusiasts developed thousands of software titles for Agat, including system software, business applications and rich frameworks for education.

<a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>n <a href="Pravetz%20Series%208">Pravetz Series 8</a> was Apple II clone with Cyrillic support.

Basis, a German company, created the Basis 108, a clone for the Apple II that included both a 6502 processor and the Zilog Z80, allowing it to run the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system as well as most Apple II software. This machine was unusual in that it was housed in a heavy cast aluminum chassis. The Basis 108 was equipped with built-in <a href="Centronics">Centronics</a> (parallel) and RS232c (serial) ports, as well as the standard six Apple II compatible slots. Unlike the Apple II it came with a detached full-stroke keyboard (AZERTY/QWERTY) of 100 keys plus 15 functions keys and separate numeric and editing keypads.

Another European Apple II clone was the <a href="Pearcom">Pearcom</a> Pear II, which was larger as the original as it sported not eight but fourteen expansion slots. It also had a numerical keypad. Pearcom initially used a pear shaped rainbow logo, but stopped after Apple threatened to take legal action.

A <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnian</a> company named <a href="IRIS%20Computers">IRIS Computers</a> (subsidiary of an electric company in Bosnia and <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a> and Yugoslavia ENERGOINVEST) produced Apple II clones starting in the early 1980s. Their official brand name was IRIS 8. They were very expensive and hard to obtain and were produced primarily for use in early computerized digital telephone systems and for education. Their use in offices of state companies, R&D labs and in the Yugoslav army was also reported. IRIS 8 machines looked like early IBM PCs, with a separate central unit accompanied by a cooling system and two 5.25-inch disks, monitor, and keyboard. Compatibility with the original Apple II was complete. Elite high schools in Yugoslavia and especially Bosnia and Herzegovina were equipped with clusters of 8, 16, or 32 IRIS 8 computers connected in a local network administrated by an IRIS 16 PC clone. The number of IRIS 8s produced is believed to be on the order of 10 or 20 thousand.

An Australian-produced clone of the Apple II was the <a href="Medfly%20computer">Medfly</a>, named after the <a href="Mediterranean%20fruit%20fly">Mediterranean fruit fly</a> that attacks apples. The Medfly computer featured a faster processor, more memory, detached keyboard, lower and upper case characters, and a built-in disk controller.

Until 1992 in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, it was illegal to import microcomputers. Because of that, the illegal cloning industry of Apple II-based computers was strong there. In the early 1980s, there were around 20 different clones of Apple II Plus computers in that country, all of them using illegally copied software and hardware (since the Apple II and II Plus used commonly available TTL integrated circuits). Some of the names include Elppa ("Apple" spelled backwards), Maxtro, Exato MC4000 (by CCE), AP II (by Unitron), and even an "Apple II Plus" (manufactured by a company called Milmar, which was using the name illegally). There were only two clones of the Apple IIe, since it used custom IC chips that could not be copied, and therefore had to be reversed-engineered and developed in the country. These clones were the TK3000 IIe by Microdigital and Exato IIe by CCE. In addition, the Laser IIc was manufactured by Milmar and, despite the name, was a clone of the Apple II Plus, not of the Apple IIc, although it had a design similar to that of the Apple IIc, with an integrated floppy controller and 80-column card, but without an integrated floppy disk drive.

The Ace clones from <a href="Franklin%20Computer%20Corporation">Franklin Computer Corporation</a> were the best known Apple II clones and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's response was that a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable in the U.S. (See <a href="Apple%20Computer%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Franklin%20Computer%20Corp.">Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.</a>) Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.

Apple also challenged <a href="VTech">VTech</a>'s <a href="Laser%20128">Laser 128</a>, an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984, in court. This suit proved less fruitful for Apple, because VTech had <a href="Reverse%20engineering">reverse-engineered</a> the Monitor ROM rather than copying it and had licensed Applesoft BASIC from its creator, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. Apple had neglected to obtain exclusive rights to the Applesoft dialect of BASIC from Microsoft; VTech was the first cloner to license it. The Laser 128 proved popular and remained on the market for many years, both in its original form and in accelerated versions that ran faster than . Although it was not fully compatible with the Apple II, it was close, and its popularity ensured that most major developers tested their software on a Laser as well as on genuine Apple machines. Because it was frequently sold via mail order and mass-market retailers such as <a href="Sears">Sears</a>, the Laser 128 cut into the sales of low-cost competitors such as <a href="Commodore%20Business%20Machines">Commodore Business Machines</a> as much as it did Apple's.

While the first Apple II clones were generally exact copies of their Apple counterparts that competed mainly on price, many clones had extra capabilities too. A Franklin model, the Ace 1000, sported a numeric keypad and lower-case long before these features were added to the Apple II line. The Laser 128 series is sometimes credited with spurring Apple to release the Apple IIc Plus; the built-in 3½-inch drive and accelerated processor were features Laser had pioneered. The Laser 128 also had a IIe-style expansion slot on the side that could be used to add peripheral cards.

<a href="Bell%20%26amp%3B%20Howell">Bell & Howell</a>, an audiovisual equipment manufacturer whose products (particularly film projectors) were ubiquitous in American schools, offered what appeared at first glance to be an Apple II Plus clone in a distinctive black plastic case. However, these were in fact real Apple II Plus units manufactured by Apple for B&H for a brief period of time. Many schools had a few of these Black Apple or <a href="Apple%20II%20Plus%23Bell%20%26amp%3B%20Howell">Black "Darth Vader" Apples</a> in their labs.

<a href="ITT%20Corporation">ITT</a> made the <a href="ITT%202020">ITT 2020</a>, a licensed Apple II Plus clone, in the UK. It has the same shape as the Apple II but was matte silver (it was sometimes known as the "silver Apple") and was not an exact copy functionally. The ITT2020 produced a <a href="PAL">PAL</a> video signal for the European market, where the domestic US market used <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a>. Software using the BIOS worked correctly on both the Apple and ITT, but software written to access the Apple's display hardware directly, bypassing the BIOS, displayed with vertical stripes on the ITT 2020. The Apple II itself was later introduced in the UK, and both the Apple II and ITT 2020 were sold for a time, the ITT at a lower price.

Syscom 2 Inc (from Carson City, NV) created the Syscom 2 Apple II+ clone. The case looked nearly identical. It had 48kb of RAM and the normal expansion capabilities. These clones also supported lower case characters, toggled with a ^O keystroke.

An unknown company produced a clone called the RX-8800. One new feature it had was a numeric keypad.

One of the best Apple II clones, SEKON, made in Taiwan, had the same color plastic case as an Apple ][, sported 48kb of RAM standard, and a lower-uppercase switch, located where the power light indicator was typically situated on Apple II's. Additionally, it featured a 5-amp power supply which supplied ample power for add-on cards. SEKON avoided shipments being confiscated by U.S. Customs, by shipping their computers without ROMS, leaving it to the dealers to populate the boards upon arrival to their private stores. Often these machines would boot up with a familiar logo of the Apple II after the dealers removed E-proms of original Apple ROMS and added them in. The reason for such activity was so that users could obtain a fully Apple-compatible clone for usually around US$600, as opposed to US$2500 from Apple.

Although not technically a clone, <a href="Quadram">Quadram</a> produced an add-in <a href="Industry%20Standard%20Architecture">ISA</a> card, called the Quadlink, that provided hardware emulation of an Apple II+ for the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>. The card had its own 6502 CPU and dedicated 80 K RAM (64 K for applications, plus 16 K to hold a reverse-engineered Apple ROM image, loaded at boot-time), and installed "between" the PC and its floppy drive(s), color display, and speaker, in a pass-through configuration. This allowed the PC to operate in a <a href="dual-boot">dual-boot</a> fashion: when booted through the Quadlink, the PC could run the majority of Apple II software, and read and write Apple-formatted floppies through the standard PC floppy drive. Because it had a dedicated processor, rather than any form of software emulation, this system ran at nearly the same speed as an equivalent Apple machine. Another company, Diamond Computer Systems, produced a similar card called the Trackstar, that had a dual pair of 6502 CPUs, and ran Apple II software using an Apple licensed ROM. The original Trackstar (and "128" and "Plus" model) was Apple II Plus compatible, while the "Trackstar E", Apple IIe compatible. The original offered 64K of usable Apple II RAM, while the other models 128K RAM (192K is on-board, with the additional memory reserved for the Trackstar itself). The original Trackstar also contained a Z80 CPU, allowing it to run both Apple DOS and Apple CP/M software, however the newer Trackstar models did not, and thus dropped CP/M compatibility. The Trackstar also had a connector allowing use of an actual Apple floppy drive, which enhanced its compatibility with software that took advantage of Apple hardware for copy-protection.

Most of the clone manufacturers chose to stop production on their own once the IBM PC became popular since it was possible to make legitimate clones of the PC which would not violate any of IBM's patents or copyrights.

Originally the Apple II used <a href="audio%20cassette">audio cassette</a> tapes for program and data storage. A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the <a href="Commodore%20Datasette">Commodore Datasette</a> was never produced; Apple recommended using the <a href="Panasonic%20Corporation">Panasonic</a> RQ309 in some of its early printed documentation. The uses of common consumer cassette recorders and a standard video monitor or television set (with a third party R-F modulator) made the total cost of owning an Apple II less expensive and helped contribute to the Apple II's success.

Cassette storage may have been inexpensive, but it was also slow and unreliable. The Apple II's lack of a disk drive was "a glaring weakness" in what was otherwise intended to be a polished, professional product. Recognizing that the II needed a disk drive to be taken seriously, Apple set out to develop a disk drive and a DOS to run it. Wozniak spent the 1977 Christmas holidays designing a disk controller that reduced the number of chips used by a factor of 10 compared to existing controllers. Still lacking a DOS, and with Wozniak inexperienced in operating system design, Jobs approached Shepardson Microsystems with the project. On April 10, 1978 Apple signed a contract for $13,000 with Sheperdson to develop the DOS.

Even after disk drives made the cassette input and output ports obsolete they were still used by enthusiasts as simple one-bit audio input-output ports. Ham radio operators used the cassette input to receive slow scan TV (single frame images). A commercial speech recognition Blackjack program was available, after some user-specific voice training it would recognize simple commands (Hit, stand). Bob Bishop's "Music Kaleidoscope" was a simple program which monitored the cassette input port and based on zero-crossings created color patterns on the screen, a predecessor to current audio visualization plug-ins for media players. Music Kaleidoscope was especially popular on projection TV sets in dance halls.

Apple and many third-party developers made software available on tape at first, but after the Disk II became available in 1978, tape-based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market. The initial price of the Disk II drive and controller was US$595, although a $100 off coupon was available through the Apple newsletter "Contact". The controller could handle two drives and a second drive (without controller) retailed for $495.

The Disk II single-sided floppy drive used 5.25-inch <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a>s; double-sided disks could be used, one side at a time, by turning them over and notching a hole for the write protect sensor. The first <a href="disk%20operating%20system">disk operating system</a>s for the Apple II were <a href="Apple%20DOS">DOS 3.1</a> and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75 kB on each disk, organized into 35 tracks of 13 256-byte sectors each. After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140 kB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable as two PROMs on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of DOS 3.2 except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare; however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track, a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks. It was possible for software developers to create a DOS 3.2 disk which would also boot on a system with DOS 3.3 firmware.

Later, double-sided drives, with heads to read both sides of the disk, became available from third-party companies. (Apple only produced double-sided 5.25" disks for the Lisa 1 computer).

On a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. (It was possible, with a special utility, to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable.) A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero – which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic "chattering" sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail – and read and execute code from sector 0. The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system. DOS stored the disk's directory on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average <a href="seek%20time">seek time</a> to the frequently used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.

Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage "crackers" from snooping around in the game's copy-protection code, since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily.

Some third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5.25-inch disks, yielding 160 kB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known commercial software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; a two byte modification to DOS to format the extra track was common.

The Apple Disk II stored 140 kB on single-sided, "single-density" floppy disks, but it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a single-sided floppy disk to 280 kB by cutting out a second write-protect notch on the side of the disk using a "disk notcher" or hole puncher and inserting the disk flipped over. Double-sided disks, with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single-sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.

Later, Apple IIs were able to use 3.5-inch disks with a total capacity of 800 kB and hard disks. DOS 3.3 did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400 kB had to be split up into multiple "virtual disk volumes."

DOS 3.3 was succeeded by <a href="Apple%20ProDOS">ProDOS</a>, a 1983 descendent of the Apple ///'s SOS. It added the capabilities for subdirectories and larger storage capacities.

ProDOS became the Apple II operating system of choice for users with these larger disks thanks to its native support of volumes up to 32 MB in size and the fact that AppleWorks and other newer programs required it.

The "II" portion of the Apple II name was rendered in a variety of creative ways using stylized characters which resembled punctuation symbols on the front lids of the computers, and most printed material followed this lead. The II and II+ were labeled <nowiki>][ and ][ plus</nowiki>. The II and II Plus were rendered in <a href="small%20caps">small caps</a>. The <a href="Apple%20III">Apple III</a>, IIc, and IIe models used slashes: ///, //c and //e.

Today, <a href="Apple%20II%20emulators">emulators</a> for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, homebrew enabled <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> and other operating systems. Numerous <a href="disk%20image">disk image</a>s of Apple II software are available free over the Internet for use with these emulators. <a href="AppleWin">AppleWin</a> and <a href="Multi%20Emulator%20Super%20System">MESS</a> are among the best emulators compatible with most Apple II images. The MESS emulator supports recording and playing back of Apple II emulation sessions, as does Home Action Replay Page (a.k.a. HARP).

However, many emulators cannot run software on copy-protected media, or can run only software employing fairly simple protection schemes, unless it is "<a href="software%20cracking">cracked</a>" (copy restrictions removed). Breaking protection on software was widely popular in the Apple II's heyday; even Apple itself apparently engaged in the practice. Commercial cracking software such as the popular <a href="Copy%20II%2B">Copy II+</a> program were sold in stores with the purpose of creating legitimate back-ups of protected software. Although creating back-ups was legitimate under copyright law of the time, the use of such software today is of questionable legality in the U.S. (see <a href="Digital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act">DMCA</a>). For those who prefer to obtain their old software legally, the Lost Classics Project has the goal of convincing copyright holders of classic Apple II software to officially allow unrestricted free distribution of their software and has "freed" a number of programs.

In addition, an active <a href="retrocomputing">retrocomputing</a> community of vintage Apple II collectors and users, continue to restore, maintain and develop hardware and software for daily use of these original computers. Numerous websites and support groups exist for these enthusiasts who maintain and use their machines. There is still a small annual convention, <a href="KansasFest">KansasFest</a>, dedicated to the platform.

The Apple II series of computers had an enormous impact on the technology industry and on everyday life. The Apple II was the first personal computer many people ever saw. Its price was within the reach of many middle-class families, and a partnership with <a href="MECC">MECC</a> helped make the Apple II popular in schools. By the end of 1980 Apple had already sold over 100,000 Apple IIs. Its popularity bootstrapped the <a href="Personal%20computer%20game">computer game</a> and <a href="educational%20software">educational software</a> markets and began the boom in the <a href="word%20processor">word processor</a> and <a href="computer%20printer">computer printer</a> markets. The first microcomputer program for business was <a href="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a>, the earliest <a href="spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a>, and it ran first on the Apple II. Many businesses bought Apple IIs just to run VisiCalc.

The Apple II series had much more business software than the rival <a href="Atari%208-bit">Atari 8-bit</a> computers. Its success caused <a href="IBM">IBM</a> to create the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>, which many businesses purchased to run spreadsheet and word processing software, at first ported from Apple II versions; later, whole new application software dynasties would be founded on the PC. The popularity of these PCs and their <a href="IBM%20PC%20compatible">clones</a> then transformed business again with <a href="local%20area%20network">LAN</a> applications such as e-mail and later Internet applications such as <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> and the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">WWW</a>.

The first 1000 or so Apple IIs shipped with a 68-page <a href="mimeograph">mimeograph</a>ed "Apple II Mini Manual" bound with brass paper fasteners. This was the basis for the "Apple II Reference Manual" (a/k/a Red book) which was published in January 1978. All existing customers who sent in their warranty cards were sent free copies of the Red Book.

The Apple II Reference Manual contained the complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the "Monitor" ROM firmware that served as the machine's <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a>.
A revised spiral bound guide released several years later with updated information had to be purchased separately, and in the case of the Apple II, the full technical documentation ran to several volumes.
The Apple II's slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. The first peripheral card was a blank prototyping card intended for electronics enthusiasts who wanted to design their own peripherals for the Apple II.

Specialty peripherals kept the Apple II in use in industry and education environments for many years after Apple Computer stopped supporting the Apple II. Well into the 1990s every clean-room (the super-clean facility where spacecraft are prepared for flight) at the Kennedy Space Center used an Apple II to monitor the environment and air quality. Most planetariums used Apple IIs to control their projectors and other equipment.

Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output. The early manuals included instructions for how to build a circuit with only four commonly available components (one transistor and three resistors) and a software routine to drive a common <a href="Teletype%20Model%2033">Teletype Model 33</a> machine. One hacker (<a href="Don%20Lancaster">Don Lancaster</a>) used the game I/O to drive a <a href="LaserWriter">LaserWriter</a> printer.

Apple III

The Apple III (often styled as apple ///) is a business-oriented personal computer produced and released by <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Computer</a> in 1980. It was intended as the successor to the <a href="Apple%20II%20series">Apple II series</a>, but was largely considered a failure in the market.

Development work on the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Dr. Wendell Sander. It had the internal code name of "Sara", named after Sander's daughter. The machine was first announced and released on May 19, 1980, but due to serious stability issues that required a design overhaul and a recall of existing machines, it was formally reintroduced in the second half of 1981. Development stopped and the Apple III was discontinued on April 24, 1984, and its last successor—the III Plus, was dropped from the Apple product line in September 1985.

The Apple III could be viewed as an enhanced Apple II – then the newest heir to a line of <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> machines dating back to 1976. However, the Apple III was not part of the Apple II line, but rather a close cousin. The key features business users wanted in a personal computer were a true typewriter-style upper/lowercase keyboard (as opposed to the Apple II, which only supported uppercase letters) and 80-column display. In addition, the machine had to pass U.S. <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) <a href="radio%20frequency%20interference">radio frequency interference</a> (RFI) qualifications for business equipment. In 1981, <a href="International%20Business%20Machines">International Business Machines</a> (IBM) unveiled the <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer">IBM Personal Computer</a> (IBM PC) – a completely new <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the <a href="PC%20DOS">PC DOS</a>/<a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> platform, eventually pulling away from the Apple 8-bit computer line.

After numerous stability issues and a recall that included the first 14,000 units from the assembly line, Apple was eventually able to produce a reliable version of the machine. However, damage to the computer's reputation had already been done and it failed to do well commercially as a direct result. In the end, an estimated 65,000–75,000 Apple III computers were sold. The Apple III Plus brought this up to approximately 120,000. Apple co-founder <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> stated that the primary reason for the Apple III's failure was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering-driven projects. The Apple III's failure led to Apple reevaluating their plan to phase out the Apple II, and eventual continuation of development of the older machine. As a result, later Apple II models incorporated some hardware, such as the Apple Scribe Printer, a thermal printer, and software technologies of the Apple III.
The Apple III was designed to be a business computer and an eventual successor for the Apple II. While the Apple II contributed to the inspirations of several important business products, such as <a href="VisiCalc">VisiCalc</a>, <a href="Multiplan">Multiplan</a> and <a href="Apple%20Writer">Apple Writer</a>, the computer's hardware architecture, <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> and developer environment were limited. The Apple III addressed these weaknesses. According to <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, VisiCalc and <a href="Disk%20II">Disk II</a> had caused the Apple II's popularity, with 90% of sales going to businesses as opposed to the hobbyists that were its original market. Apple management intended to clearly establish <a href="market%20segmentation">market segmentation</a> by designing the Apple III to appeal to the business market, leaving the Apple II to home and education users. Management believed that "once the Apple III was out, the Apple II would stop selling in six months", Wozniak said.

The Apple III is powered by a 1.8 <a href="megahertz">MHz</a> <a href="Synertek">Synertek 6502A</a> or B <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> <a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> and, like some of the later machines in the Apple II family, uses <a href="bank%20switching">bank switching</a> techniques to address memory beyond the 6502's traditional 64KB limit, up to 256 K in the IIIs case. Third-party vendors also produced memory upgrade kits that allow the Apple III to reach up to 512 KB. Other Apple III built-in features include an 80-column, 24-line display with upper and lowercase characters, a numeric keypad, dual-speed (pressure-sensitive) cursor control keys, 6-bit (DAC) audio, and a built-in 140 KB 5.25" <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a> drive. Graphics modes include 560x192 in black and white, and 280x192 with 16 colors or shades of gray. Unlike the Apple II, the Disk III controller is part of the logic board.

The Apple III is the first Apple product to allow the user to choose both a screen font and a keyboard layout: either <a href="QWERTY">QWERTY</a> or <a href="Dvorak%20Simplified%20Keyboard">Dvorak</a>. These choices can not be changed while programs were running, unlike the <a href="Apple%20IIc">Apple IIc</a>, which has a keyboard switch directly above the keyboard, allowing switching on the fly.

A major limitation of the Apple II and DOS 3.3 is the way it addresses resources, which makes it highly desirable for <a href="peripherals">peripherals</a> to be installed in standardized locations (slot 5 and 6 reserved for storage devices, slot 2 reserved for serial communication interfaces, etc.) This forces the user to identify a peripheral by its physical location, such as codice_1, and so on. The Apple III introduced an advanced operating system called <a href="Apple%20SOS">Apple SOS</a>, pronounced "apple sauce". Its ability to address resources by name instead of a physical location allows the Apple III to be more scalable than the Apple II. Apple SOS also allows the full capacity of a storage device to be used as a single volume, such as the <a href="Apple%20ProFile">Apple ProFile</a> hard disk drive. Also, Apple SOS supports a hierarchical file system (HFS). Some of the features and code base of Apple SOS were migrated into the Apple II's <a href="ProDOS">ProDOS</a> and <a href="GS/OS">GS/OS</a> operating systems, as well as <a href="Apple%20Lisa">Lisa 7/7</a> and <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Macintosh system software</a>.

With a starting price between $4,340 to $7,800 US, the Apple III was more expensive than many of the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a>-based business computers that were available at the time. Little Apple III software was available besides VisiCalc, and because Apple did not view the Apple III as suitable for hobbyists, it did not provide much of the technical software information that accompanied the Apple II. Originally intended as a direct replacement to the Apple II series, it was designed to be <a href="backward%20compatible">backward compatible</a> with Apple II software. However, since Apple did not want to encourage continued development of the II platform, Apple II compatibility existed only in a special "Apple II Mode" which was limited in its capabilities to the emulation of a basic 48 KB Apple II+ configuration. Special chips were intentionally added to prevent access to the III's advanced features such as its larger memory.

The Apple III has four expansion slots, a number that "inCider" in 1986 called "miserly". Apple II cards are compatible but risk violating government <a href="radio-frequency%20interference">RFI</a> regulations, and require Apple III-specific device drivers; "BYTE" stated that "Apple provides virtually no information on how to write them". As with software, Apple provided little hardware technical information with the computer but Apple III-specific products became available, such as one that made the computer compatible with the <a href="Apple%20IIe">Apple IIe</a>. Several new Apple-produced peripherals were developed for the Apple III. The original Apple III has a built-in real-time clock, which is recognized by Apple SOS. The clock was later removed from the "revised" model, and instead was made available as an add-on.

Along with the built-in floppy drive, the Apple III can also handle up to three additional external Disk III floppy disk drives. The <a href="Disk%20III">Disk III</a> is only officially compatible with the Apple III. The Apple III Plus requires an adaptor from Apple to use the Disk III with its DB-25 disk port.
With the introduction of the revised Apple III a year after launch, Apple began offering the <a href="Apple%20ProFile">ProFile</a> external hard disk system. Costing US$3499 for 5MB, it also required a peripheral slot for the ProFile controller card.

Once the logic board design flaws were discovered, a newer logic board design was produced – which includes a lower power requirement, wider traces, and better designed chip sockets. The $3,495 revised model also includes 256 <a href="KiB">KiB</a> RAM as a standard configuration. The 14,000 units of the original Apple III sold were returned and replaced with the entirely new revised model.

Apple discontinued the III in October 1983 because it violated Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, and the FCC required the company to change the redesigned computer's name. It introduced the Apple III Plus in December 1983 at a price of US$2995. This newer version includes a built-in clock, video interlacing, standardized rear port connectors, 55-watt power supply, 256 KiB RAM as standard, and a redesigned, IIe-like keyboard.

Owners of the Apple III could purchase individual III Plus upgrades, like the clock and interlacing feature, and obtain the newer logic board as a service replacement. A keyboard upgrade kit, dubbed "Apple III Plus upgrade kit" was also made available – which included the keyboard, cover, keyboard encoder ROM, and logo replacements. This upgrade had to be installed by an authorized service technician.

According to Wozniak, the Apple III "had 100 percent hardware failures". Former Apple executive Taylor Pohlman recalled this:

<a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> insisted on the idea of no fan or air vents, in order to make the computer run quietly. Jobs would later push this same ideology onto almost all Apple models he had control of, from the <a href="Apple%20Lisa">Apple Lisa</a> and <a href="Macintosh%20128K">Macintosh 128K</a> to the <a href="iMac">iMac</a>. To allow the computer to dissipate heat, the base of the Apple III was made of heavy cast aluminum, which supposedly acts as a heat sink. One undeniable advantage to the aluminum case was a reduction in RFI (Radio Frequency Interference), a problem which had plagued the Apple II series throughout its history. Unlike the Apple II series, the power supply was mounted – without its own shell – in a compartment separate from the logic board. The decision to use an aluminum shell ultimately led to engineering issues which resulted in the Apple III's reliability problems. The lead time for manufacturing the shells was high, and this had to be done before the motherboard was finalized. Later it was realized that there wasn't enough room on the motherboard for all of the components unless narrow traces were used.

Many Apple IIIs were thought to have failed due to their inability to properly dissipate heat. "inCider" stated in 1986 that "Heat has always been a formidable enemy of the Apple ///", and some users reported that their Apple IIIs became so hot that the chips started dislodging from the board, causing the screen to display garbled data or their <a href="Floppy%20disks">disk</a> to come out of the slot "melted". "<a href="BYTE">BYTE</a>" wrote, "the integrated circuits tended to <a href="chip%20creep">wander out of their sockets</a>". Apple advised customers to tilt the front of the Apple III six inches above the desk, and then drop it to reseat the chips. Other analyses blame a faulty automatic chip insertion process, not heat.

Case designer <a href="Jerry%20Manock">Jerry Manock</a> denied the design flaw charges, stating that tests proved that the unit adequately dissipated the internal heat. The primary cause, he claimed, was a major logic board design problem. The logic board used "fineline" technology that was not fully mature at the time, with narrow, closely spaced traces. When chips were "stuffed" into the board and <a href="Wave%20soldering">wave-soldered</a>, solder bridges would form between traces that were not supposed to be connected. This caused numerous short circuits, which required hours of costly diagnosis and hand rework to fix. Apple designed a new circuit board, with more layers and normal-width traces. The new logic board was laid out by one designer on a huge drafting board, rather than using the costly <a href="Computer-aided%20design">CAD</a>-<a href="Computer-aided%20manufacturing">CAM</a> system used for the previous board, and the new design worked.

Earlier Apple III units came with a built-in real time clock. The hardware, however, would fail after prolonged use. Assuming that <a href="National%20Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a> would test all parts before shipping them, Apple did not perform this level of testing. Apple was soldering chips directly to boards, and could not easily change out a bad chip if one was found. Eventually, Apple solved this problem by removing the real-time clock from the Apple III's specification rather than shipping the Apple III with the clock pre-installed, and then sold the peripheral as a level 1 technician add-on.

The Apple III's technical problems made marketing the computer difficult. One distributor's representative described the computer as "a complete disaster", recalling that he "was responsible for going to every dealership, setting up the Apple III in their showroom, and then explaining to them the functions of the Apple III, which in many cases didn’t really work". Pohlman stated that Apple was only selling 500 units a month by late 1981, mostly as replacements. The company was able to raise monthly sales to 5,000, but the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>'s successful launch encouraged software companies to develop for it instead, causing Apple to shift focus to the Lisa and Macintosh. By early 1984 sales were only to existing III owners, Apple itself—its 4500 employees had about 3000-4500 units—and some small businesses. Despite formerly devoting the majority of its R&D to the III and so ignoring the II that for a while dealers had difficulty in obtaining the latter, Apple discontinued the Apple III series on April 24, 1984, four months after introducing the III Plus, after selling 65,000-75,000 computers and replacing 14,000 defective units.

Jobs stated that Apple lost "infinite, incalculable amounts" of money on the Apple III. Pohlman claimed that there was a "stigma" at the company associated with having contributed to the computer. Most employees who worked on the III reportedly left Apple.

The <a href="filesystem">filesystem</a> and some design ideas from <a href="Apple%20SOS">Apple SOS</a>, the Apple III's operating system, were part of <a href="Apple%20ProDOS">Apple ProDOS</a> and <a href="Apple%20GS/OS">Apple GS/OS</a>, the major operating systems for the <a href="Apple%20II%20series">Apple II series</a> following the demise of the Apple III, as well as the <a href="Apple%20Lisa">Apple Lisa</a>, which was the de facto business-oriented successor to the Apple III. The <a href="hierarchical%20file%20system">hierarchical file system</a> influenced the evolution of the Macintosh: while the original <a href="Macintosh%20File%20System">Macintosh File System</a> (MFS) was a <a href="flat%20file%20system">flat file system</a> designed for a floppy disk without subdirectories, subsequent file systems were hierarchical. By comparison, the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>'s first <a href="FAT12">file system</a> (again designed for floppy disks) was also flat and later versions (designed for hard disks) were hierarchical.

At the start of the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a> film <a href="Tron">TRON</a>, lead character Kevin Flynn (played by <a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a>) is seen hacking into the ENCOM <a href="mainframe">mainframe</a> using an Apple III.

Astrology

Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of <a href="celestial%20objects">celestial objects</a> as a means for <a href="divination">divining</a> information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the <a href="2nd%20millennium%20BCE">2nd millennium BCE</a>, and has its roots in <a href="Calendrical%20calculation">calendrical</a> systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the <a href="Hindu%20astrology">Indians</a>, <a href="Chinese%20astrology">Chinese</a>, and <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya</a> – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. <a href="Western%20astrology">Western astrology</a>, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a> <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, from which it spread to <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>, the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a> and eventually <a href="Central%20Europe">Central</a> and <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a>s that purport to explain aspects of a person's <a href="personality">personality</a> and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.

Throughout most of its history astrology was considered a scholarly tradition and was common in academic circles, often in close relation with <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>, <a href="meteorology">meteorology</a>, and medicine. It was present in political circles, and is mentioned in various works of literature, from <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> to <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="Lope%20de%20Vega">Lope de Vega</a> and <a href="Calder%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Barca">Calderón de la Barca</a>.

During the 20th century and following the wide-scale adoption of the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>, astrology has been challenged successfully on both <a href="Scientific%20theory">theoretical</a> and <a href="experiment">experiment</a>al grounds, and has been shown to have no <a href="Science">scientific</a> validity or <a href="explanatory%20power">explanatory power</a>. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined.

The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.

Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium <a href="BCE">BCE</a>, with roots in <a href="Calendrical%20calculation">calendrical</a> systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. A form of astrology was practised in the first dynasty of <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (1950–1651 BCE). Chinese astrology was elaborated in the <a href="Zhou%20dynasty">Zhou dynasty</a> (1046–256 BCE). <a href="Hellenistic%20astrology">Hellenistic astrology</a> after 332 BCE mixed <a href="Babylonian%20astrology">Babylonian astrology</a> with Egyptian <a href="Decans">Decanic astrology</a> in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, creating <a href="horoscopic%20astrology">horoscopic astrology</a>. <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great's</a> conquest of <a href="Asia">Asia</a> allowed astrology to spread to <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>. In Rome, astrology was associated with '<a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>n wisdom'. After the conquest of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and <a href="Latin%20translations%20of%20the%2012th%20century">translated into Latin</a>. Major astronomers including <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> and <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a> practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature in the works of poets such as <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>, and of playwrights such as <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a> and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>.

Throughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>, <a href="meteorology">meteorology</a>, and medicine. At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as <a href="heliocentrism">heliocentrism</a> and <a href="classical%20mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a>) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.

Astrology, in its broadest sense, is the search for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that <a href="lunar%20cycle">lunar cycle</a>s were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the <a href="constellations">constellations</a> that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with <a href="heliacal%20rising">heliacal rising</a>s of the stars.

Scattered evidence suggests that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world. The <a href="Venus%20tablet%20of%20Ammisaduqa">Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa</a> thought to be compiled in <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> around 1700 BCE. A scroll documenting an early use of <a href="electional%20astrology">electional astrology</a> is doubtfully ascribed to the reign of the <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian ruler <a href="Gudea%20of%20Lagash">Gudea of Lagash</a> (c. 2144 – 2124 BCE). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple. However, there is controversy about whether these were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (1950–1651 BCE). This astrology had some parallels with <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> Greek (western) astrology, including the zodiac, a norming point near 9 degrees in Aries, the trine aspect, planetary exaltations, and the dodekatemoria (the twelve divisions of 30 degrees each). The Babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes of physical events.

The system of <a href="Chinese%20astrology">Chinese astrology</a> was elaborated during the <a href="Zhou%20dynasty">Zhou dynasty</a> (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during which all the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, theory of the five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.

<a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> stated the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can be very different), later developed by <a href="Saint%20Augustine">Saint Augustine</a>. He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.

<a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a> argued that since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.

<a href="Favorinus">Favorinus</a> argued that it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies in the same way as they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. <a href="Sextus%20Empiricus">Sextus Empiricus</a> argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about the signs of the zodiac. <a href="Carneades">Carneades</a> argued that belief in fate denies <a href="free%20will">free will</a> and <a href="morality">morality</a>; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.

In 525 BCE, Egypt was conquered by the Persians. The 1st century BCE Egyptian <a href="Dendera%20Zodiac">Dendera Zodiac</a> shares two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion – with Mesopotamian astrology.

With the occupation by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> in 332 BCE, Egypt became <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a>. The city of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> was founded by Alexander after the conquest, becoming the place where <a href="Babylonian%20astrology">Babylonian astrology</a> was mixed with Egyptian <a href="Decans">Decanic astrology</a> to create <a href="Horoscopic%20astrology">Horoscopic astrology</a>. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary <a href="exaltation%20%28astrology%29">exaltation</a>s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. It used the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, and the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and <a href="four%20elements">four elements</a>. 2nd century BCE texts predict positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis. The <a href="astrologer">astrologer</a> and astronomer <a href="Ptolemy%23Astrology">Ptolemy</a> lived in Alexandria. Ptolemy's work the "<a href="Tetrabiblos">Tetrabiblos</a>" formed the basis of Western astrology, and, "...enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more."

The conquest of <a href="Asia">Asia</a> by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> exposed the Greeks to ideas from <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Around 280 BCE, <a href="Berossus">Berossus</a>, a priest of <a href="Marduk">Bel</a> from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of <a href="Kos">Kos</a>, teaching astrology and Babylonian culture. By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a>s to describe the past, present and future; the other, <a href="theurgic">theurgic</a>, emphasising the <a href="soul">soul's</a> ascent to the stars. Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>.

The first definite reference to astrology in Rome comes from the orator <a href="Cato%20the%20Elder">Cato</a>, who in 160 BCE warned farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans, who were described as Babylonian 'star-gazers'. Among both Greeks and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, Babylonia (also known as <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' became <a href="synonym">synonym</a>ous with <a href="divination">divination</a> using planets and stars. The 2nd-century Roman poet and satirist <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a> complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, saying, "Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Hammon's</a> fountain."

One of the first astrologers to bring <a href="Hermeticism">Hermetic</a> astrology to Rome was <a href="Thrasyllus%20of%20Mendes">Thrasyllus</a>, astrologer to the <a href="emperor">emperor</a> <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>, the first emperor to have had a court astrologer, though his predecessor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> had used astrology to help legitimise his <a href="Imperialism">Imperial</a> rights.

The main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the "<a href="B%E1%B9%9Bhat%20Par%C4%81%C5%9Bara%20Hor%C4%81%C5%9B%C4%81stra"></a>", and "<a href="S%C4%81r%C4%81val%C4%AB">Sārāvalī</a>" by .
The "Horāshastra" is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the later 8th century. The "Sārāvalī" likewise dates to around 800 CE. English translations of these texts were published by N.N. Krishna Rau and V.B. Choudhari in 1963 and 1961, respectively.

Astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars following the collapse of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> to the Arabs in the 7th century, and the founding of the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid empire</a> in the 8th. The second Abbasid <a href="caliph">caliph</a>, <a href="Al%20Mansur">Al Mansur</a> (754–775) founded the city of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> to act as a centre of learning, and included in its design a library-translation centre known as "Bayt al-Hikma" 'House of Wisdom', which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic-Persian translations of Hellenistic astrological texts. The early translators included <a href="Mashallah%20ibn%20Athari">Mashallah</a>, who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad, and <a href="Sahl%20ibn%20Bishr">Sahl ibn Bishr</a>, ("a.k.a." "Zael"), whose texts were directly influential upon later European astrologers such as <a href="Guido%20Bonatti">Guido Bonatti</a> in the 13th century, and <a href="William%20Lilly">William Lilly</a> in the 17th century. Knowledge of Arabic texts started to become imported into Europe during the <a href="Latin%20translations%20of%20the%2012th%20century">Latin translations of the 12th century</a>.

The first astrological book published in Europe was the "Liber Planetis et Mundi Climatibus" ("Book of the Planets and Regions of the World"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, and may have been authored by <a href="Gerbert%20of%20Aurillac">Gerbert of Aurillac</a>. <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy's</a> second century AD "<a href="Tetrabiblos">Tetrabiblos</a>" was translated into Latin by <a href="Plato%20Tiburtinus">Plato of Tivoli</a> in 1138. The <a href="Dominican%20order">Dominican</a> theologian <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> followed <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. The thirteenth century mathematician <a href="Campanus%20of%20Novara">Campanus of Novara</a> is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the <a href="prime%20vertical">prime vertical</a> into 'houses' of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. The thirteenth century <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Guido%20Bonatti">Guido Bonatti</a> wrote a textbook, the "Liber Astronomicus", a copy of which King <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII of England</a> owned at the end of the fifteenth century.

In "<a href="Paradiso%20%28Dante%29">Paradiso</a>", the final part of the "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>", the Italian poet <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> referred "in countless details" to the astrological planets, though he adapted traditional astrology to suit his Christian viewpoint, for example using astrological thinking in his prophecies of the reform of Christendom.

In the seventh century, <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a> argued in his "<a href="Etymologiae">Etymologiae</a>" that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous. In contrast, <a href="John%20Gower">John Gower</a> in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people. The fourteenth century sceptic <a href="Nicole%20Oresme">Nicole Oresme</a> however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his "Livre de divinacions". Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 "Contre les Devineurs". This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer <a href="Albumasar">Albumasar</a> (787-886) whose "Introductorium in Astronomiam" and "De Magnis Coniunctionibus" argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.

<a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> scholars commonly practised astrology. <a href="Gerolamo%20Cardano">Gerolamo Cardano</a> cast the horoscope of king <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI of England</a>, while <a href="John%20Dee">John Dee</a> was the personal astrologer to queen <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a>. <a href="Catherine%20de%20Medici">Catherine de Medici</a> paid <a href="Michael%20Nostradamus">Michael Nostradamus</a> in 1566 to verify the prediction of the death of her husband, king <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II of France</a> made by her astrologer Lucus Gauricus. Major astronomers who practised as court astrologers included <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> in the royal court of Denmark, <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> to the <a href="Habsburgs">Habsburgs</a>, <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> to the <a href="Medici">Medici</a>, and <a href="Giordano%20Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a> who was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in 1600. The distinction between astrology and astronomy was not entirely clear. Advances in astronomy were often motivated by the desire to improve the accuracy of astrology.

<a href="Ephemeris">Ephemerides</a> with complex astrological calculations, and <a href="almanac">almanac</a>s interpreting celestial events for use in medicine and for choosing times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="physician">physician</a> <a href="Thomas%20Hood%20%28mathematician%29">Thomas Hood</a> made a set of paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve <a href="House%20%28astrology%29">astrological houses</a>. Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between the signs of the zodiac, the planets, and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the planets and signs. While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from <a href="Gerard%20Mercator">Gerard Mercator's</a> astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator.

English astrology had reached its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, as well as providing individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with <a href="religion">religion</a>, <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a> and <a href="science">science</a>.

During <a href="the%20Enlightenment">the Enlightenment</a>, intellectual sympathy for astrology fell away, leaving only a popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed the spirit of the age by printing a derisive "Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology", while in France <a href="Pierre%20Bayle">Pierre Bayle's</a> "Dictionnaire" of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> <a href="satire">satirist</a> <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> ridiculed the <a href="Whiggism">Whig</a> political astrologer <a href="John%20Partridge%20%28astrologer%29">John Partridge</a>.

Astrology saw a popular revival starting in the 19th century, as part of a general revival of <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a> and—later, <a href="New%20Age">New Age</a> philosophy, and through the influence of mass media such as newspaper horoscopes. Early in the 20th century the psychiatrist <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a> developed some concepts concerning astrology, which led to the development of <a href="psychological%20astrology">psychological astrology</a>.

Advocates have defined astrology as a symbolic language, an <a href="art">art</a> form, a <a href="science">science</a>, and a method of divination. Though most cultural astrology systems share common roots in ancient philosophies that influenced each other, many use methods that differ from those in the West. These include Hindu astrology (also known as "Indian astrology" and in modern times referred to as "Vedic astrology") and Chinese astrology, both of which have influenced the world's cultural history.

<a href="Western%20astrology">Western astrology</a> is a form of <a href="divination">divination</a> based on the construction of a <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a> for an exact moment, such as a person's birth. It uses the tropical zodiac, which is aligned to the <a href="Equinox">equinoctial points</a>.

Western astrology is founded on the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through <a href="Astrological%20sign">signs</a> of the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a> (twelve spatial divisions of the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>) and by their <a href="Astrological%20aspect">aspects</a> (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in <a href="House%20%28astrology%29">houses</a> (twelve spatial divisions of the sky). Astrology's modern representation in western popular media is usually reduced to <a href="sun%20sign%20astrology">sun sign astrology</a>, which considers only the zodiac sign of the Sun at an individual's date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.

The horoscope visually expresses the set of relationships for the time and place of the chosen event. These relationships are between the seven 'planets', signifying tendencies such as war and love; the twelve signs of the zodiac; and the twelve houses. Each planet is in a particular sign and a particular house at the chosen time, when observed from the chosen place, creating two kinds of relationship. A third kind is the aspect of each planet to every other planet, where for example two planets 120° apart (in 'trine') are in a harmonious relationship, but two planets 90° apart ('square') are in a conflicted relationship. Together these relationships and their interpretations supposedly form "...the language of the heavens speaking to learned men."

Along with <a href="tarot%20divination">tarot divination</a>, astrology is one of the core studies of <a href="Western%20esotericism">Western esotericism</a>, and as such has influenced systems of <a href="magic%20%28paranormal%29">magical</a> belief not only among Western esotericists and <a href="Hermeticism">Hermeticists</a>, but also belief systems such as <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a> that have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. <a href="Tanya%20Luhrmann">Tanya Luhrmann</a> has said that "all magicians know something about astrology," and refers to a <a href="table%20of%20correspondences">table of correspondences</a> in <a href="Starhawk">Starhawk's</a> "<a href="The%20Spiral%20Dance">The Spiral Dance</a>", organised by <a href="planets%20in%20astrology">planet</a>, as an example of the astrological lore studied by magicians.

The earliest <a href="Veda">Vedic</a> text on astronomy is the "<a href="Vedanga%20Jyotisha">Vedanga Jyotisha</a>"; Vedic thought later came to include astrology as well.

Hindu natal astrology originated with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though incorporating the Hindu lunar mansions. The names of the signs (e.g. Greek 'Krios' for Aries, Hindi 'Kriya'), the planets (e.g. Greek 'Helios' for Sun, astrological Hindi 'Heli'), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek 'apoklima' and 'sunaphe' for declination and planetary conjunction, Hindi 'apoklima' and 'sunapha' respectively) in Varaha Mihira's texts are considered conclusive evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology. The Indian techniques may also have been augmented with some of the Babylonian techniques.

Chinese astrology has a close relation with <a href="Chinese%20philosophy">Chinese philosophy</a> (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as <a href="yin%20and%20yang">yin and yang</a>, the <a href="wu%20xing">Five phases</a>, the 10 <a href="Celestial%20stems">Celestial stems</a>, the 12 <a href="Earthly%20Branches">Earthly Branches</a>, and <a href="shichen">shichen</a> (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to <a href="political%20astrology">political astrology</a>, the observation of unusual phenomena, identification of <a href="portent%20%28divination%29">portent</a>s and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.

The constellations of the Zodiac of western Asia and Europe were not used; instead the sky is divided into <a href="Three%20Enclosures">Three Enclosures</a> (三垣 sān yuán), and <a href="Twenty-eight%20Mansions">Twenty-eight Mansions</a> (二十八宿 èrshíbā xiù) in twelve Ci (). The Chinese zodiac of twelve <a href="Astrological%20sign%23Chinese%20zodiac%20signs">animal signs</a> is said to represent twelve different types of <a href="personality">personality</a>. It is based on cycles of years, lunar months, and two-hour periods of the day (the shichen). The zodiac traditionally begins with the sign of the <a href="Rat%20%28zodiac%29">Rat</a>, and the cycle proceeds through 11 other animals signs: the <a href="Ox%20%28zodiac%29">Ox</a>, <a href="Tiger%20%28zodiac%29">Tiger</a>, <a href="Rabbit%20%28zodiac%29">Rabbit</a>, <a href="Dragon%20%28zodiac%29">Dragon</a>, <a href="Snake%20%28zodiac%29">Snake</a>, <a href="Horse%20%28zodiac%29">Horse</a>, <a href="Goat%20%28zodiac%29">Goat</a>, <a href="Monkey%20%28zodiac%29">Monkey</a>, <a href="Rooster%20%28zodiac%29">Rooster</a>, <a href="Dog%20%28zodiac%29">Dog</a>, and <a href="Pig%20%28zodiac%29">Pig</a>. Complex systems of predicting <a href="fate">fate</a> and destiny based on one's birthday, birth season, and birth hours, such as "ziping" and <a href="Zi%20wei%20dou%20shu">Zi Wei Dou Shu</a> () are still used regularly in modern-day Chinese astrology. They do not rely on direct observations of the stars.

The Korean zodiac is identical to the Chinese one. The Vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to Chinese zodiac except the second animal is the "<a href="Water%20buffalo%20%28zodiac%29">Water Buffalo</a>" instead of the "<a href="Ox%20%28zodiac%29">Ox</a>", and the fourth animal is the "<a href="Cat%20%28zodiac%29">Cat</a>" instead of the "<a href="Rabbit%20%28zodiac%29">Rabbit</a>". The Japanese have since 1873 celebrated the beginning of the new year on 1 January as per the <a href="Gregorian%20Calendar">Gregorian Calendar</a>. The Thai zodiac begins, not at <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">Chinese New Year</a>, but either on the first day of fifth month in the <a href="Thai%20lunar%20calendar">Thai lunar calendar</a>, or during the <a href="Songkran%20%28Thailand%29">Songkran</a> festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.

<a href="St.%20Augustine">St. Augustine</a> (354430) believed that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil, but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived at the same moment and born at approximately the same time.

Some of the practices of astrology were contested on theological grounds by medieval Muslim astronomers such as <a href="Al-Farabi">Al-Farabi</a> (Alpharabius), <a href="Ibn%20al-Haytham">Ibn al-Haytham</a> (Alhazen) and <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>. They said that the methods of astrologers conflicted with orthodox religious views of <a href="Ulema">Islamic scholars</a>, by suggesting that the Will of God can be known and predicted in advance. For example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology', "Risāla fī ibṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm", argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle that planets may act as agents of divine causation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the possibility of determining the exact influence of the stars. Essentially, Avicenna did not deny the core dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it. <a href="Ibn%20Qayyim%20Al-Jawziyya">Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya</a> (1292–1350), in his "Miftah Dar al-SaCadah", also used <a href="physics">physical</a> arguments in astronomy to question the practice of judicial astrology. He recognised that the <a href="star">star</a>s are much larger than the <a href="planet">planet</a>s, and argued:

The <a href="Catechism%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a> maintains that divination, including predictive astrology, is incompatible with modern <a href="Catholicism">Catholic</a> beliefs such as free will:

The scientific community rejects astrology as having no explanatory power for describing the universe, and considers it a <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>. Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. There is no proposed <a href="Scientific%20modelling">mechanism of action</a> by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well understood, basic aspects of biology and physics. Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so "...in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary."

<a href="Confirmation%20bias">Confirmation bias</a> is a form of <a href="cognitive%20bias">cognitive bias</a>, a <a href="Psychology">psychological</a> factor that contributes to belief in astrology. Astrology believers tend to selectively remember predictions that turn out to be true, and do not remember those that turn out false. Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not. Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.

Under the criterion of <a href="falsifiability">falsifiability</a>, first proposed by <a href="philosopher%20of%20science">philosopher of science</a> <a href="Karl%20Popper">Karl Popper</a>, astrology is a pseudoscience. Popper regarded astrology as "pseudo-empirical" in that "it appeals to observation and experiment," but "nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards." In contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology has not responded to falsification through experiment.

In contrast to Popper, the philosopher <a href="Thomas%20Kuhn">Thomas Kuhn</a> argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical. Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to <a href="medieval%20medicine">medieval medicine</a>; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research, and so "they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise." While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.

The philosopher <a href="Paul%20Thagard">Paul Thagard</a> asserts that astrology cannot be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative. To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience is that the state-of-the-art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be "selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations." Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years. To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in <a href="normal%20science">normal science</a> believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the "many unsolved problems," and in the face of better alternative theories (psychology). For these reasons Thagard views astrology as pseudoscience.

For the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.

Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in <a href="Experiment">controlled studies</a> and has no scientific validity. Where it has made <a href="falsifiable">falsifiable</a> predictions under <a href="Scientific%20control">controlled conditions</a>, they have been falsified. One famous experiment included 28 astrologers who were asked to match over a hundred natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the <a href="California%20Psychological%20Inventory">California Psychological Inventory</a> (CPI) questionnaire. The <a href="Blind%20experiment%23Double-blind%20trials">double-blind</a> experimental protocol used in this study was agreed upon by a group of physicists and a group of astrologers nominated by the <a href="National%20Council%20for%20Geocosmic%20Research">National Council for Geocosmic Research</a>, who advised the experimenters, helped ensure that the test was fair and helped draw the central proposition of <a href="natal%20astrology">natal astrology</a> to be tested. They also chose 26 out of the 28 astrologers for the tests (two more volunteered afterwards). The study, published in <a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">"Nature"</a> in 1985, found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing "...clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis."

In 1955, the astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that though he had failed to find evidence that supported indicators like <a href="Astrological%20signs">zodiacal signs</a> and <a href="Astrological%20aspects">planetary aspects</a> in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the <a href="Diurnal%20motion">diurnal positions</a> of some <a href="Planets%20in%20astrology">planets</a> and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the <a href="natal%20chart">natal chart</a>s of successful athletes and became known as the "<a href="Mars%20effect">Mars effect</a>". A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.

Dean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test that involved more than one hundred <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a>, <a href="behavioural">behavioural</a>, <a href="physiological">physical</a>, and other variables—but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, a <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.

Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult, because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.

Many astrologers claim that astrology is scientific, while some have proposed conventional <a href="Causality">causal agent</a>s such as <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> and <a href="gravity">gravity</a>. Scientists reject these mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.

Western astrology has taken the earth's <a href="Precession%23Axial%20precession%20%28precession%20of%20the%20equinoxes%29">axial precession (also called precession of the equinoxes)</a> into account since Ptolemy's "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>", so the 'first point of Aries', the start of the astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars. The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated <a href="Astrological%20sign">sign</a>, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being "...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars." Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the <a href="Age%20of%20Aquarius">Age of Aquarius</a>, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.

Astrologers usually have only a small knowledge of astronomy, and often do not take into account basic principles—such as the precession of the equinoxes, which changes the position of the sun with time. They commented on the example of <a href="%C3%89lizabeth%20Teissier">Élizabeth Teissier</a>, who claimed that, "The sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year," as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday, but a number of years apart, should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that, "There is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years," and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.

In the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers. For example, the British intelligence agency <a href="MI5">MI5</a> employed <a href="Louis%20de%20Wohl">Louis de Wohl</a> as an astrologer after claims surfaced that <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> used astrology to time his actions. The War Office was "...interested to know what Hitler's own astrologers would be telling him from week to week." In fact, de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a "complete charlatan," and later evidence showed that Hitler considered astrology "complete nonsense." After <a href="John%20Hinckley">John Hinckley's</a> <a href="Attempted%20assassination%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">attempted assassination</a> of US President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, first lady <a href="Nancy%20Reagan">Nancy Reagan</a> commissioned astrologer <a href="Joan%20Quigley">Joan Quigley</a> to act as the secret White House astrologer. However, Quigley's role ended in 1988 when it became public through the memoirs of former chief of staff, <a href="Donald%20Regan">Donald Regan</a>.

There was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist <a href="Marcello%20Truzzi">Marcello Truzzi</a> described three levels of involvement of "Astrology-believers" to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing "next to nothing" about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from "tension-management of anxieties" and "a cognitive belief-system that transcends science." Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a ""meaningful" view of their universe and [gave] them an "understanding" of their place in it." This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a "sacred canopy", whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.

In 1953, the sociologist <a href="Theodor%20W.%20Adorno">Theodor W. Adorno</a> conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project examining mass culture in capitalist society. Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably leads to statements that encouraged conformity—and that astrologers who go against conformity, by discouraging performance at work etc., risk losing their jobs. Adorno concluded that astrology is a large-scale manifestation of systematic <a href="irrationalism">irrationalism</a>, where individuals are subtly led—through flattery and vague generalisations—to believe that the author of the column is addressing them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase <a href="opium%20of%20the%20people">opium of the people</a>, by Karl Marx, by commenting, "occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes."

A 2005 <a href="Gallup%20%28company%29">Gallup</a> poll and a 2009 survey by the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a> reported that 25% of US adults believe in astrology. According to data released in the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation's</a> 2014 "Science and Engineering Indicators" study, "Fewer Americans rejected astrology in 2012 than in recent years." The NSF study noted that in 2012, "slightly more than half of Americans said that astrology was 'not at all scientific,' whereas nearly two-thirds gave this response in 2010. The comparable percentage has not been this low since 1983."

In India, there is a long-established and widespread belief in astrology. It is commonly used for daily life, particularly in matters concerning marriage and career, and makes extensive use of <a href="electional%20astrology">electional</a>, <a href="horary%20astrology">horary</a> and <a href="karmic%20astrology">karmic astrology</a>. Indian politics have also been influenced by astrology. It is still considered a branch of the <a href="Vedanga">Vedanga</a>. In 2001, Indian scientists and politicians debated and critiqued a proposal to use state money to fund research into astrology, resulting in permission for <a href="List%20of%20universities%20in%20India">Indian universities</a> to offer courses in Vedic astrology.

On February 2011, the <a href="Bombay%20High%20Court">Bombay High Court</a> reaffirmed astrology's standing in India when it dismissed a case that challenged its status as a science.

In <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, strong belief in astrology has led to dramatic changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of "Fire Horse". Adherents believe that women born in "hinoeuma" years are unmarriageable and bring bad luck to their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.

The fourteenth-century English poets <a href="John%20Gower">John Gower</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> both referred to astrology in their works, including Gower's "<a href="Confessio%20Amantis">Confessio Amantis</a>" and Chaucer's "<a href="The%20Canterbury%20Tales">The Canterbury Tales</a>". Chaucer commented explicitly on astrology in his "Treatise on the Astrolabe", demonstrating personal knowledge of one area, judicial astrology, with an account of how to find the ascendant or rising sign.

In the fifteenth century, references to astrology, such as with <a href="simile">simile</a>s, became "a matter of course" in English literature.

In the sixteenth century, John Lyly's 1597 play, "The Woman in the Moon", is wholly motivated by astrology, while <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a> makes astrological references in his plays "<a href="Doctor%20Faustus%20%28play%29">Doctor Faustus</a>" and "<a href="Tamburlaine">Tamburlaine</a>" (both c. 1590), and <a href="Sir%20Philip%20Sidney">Sir Philip Sidney</a> refers to astrology at least four times in his <a href="Romance%20%28heroic%20literature%29">romance</a> "<a href="The%20Countess%20of%20Pembroke%27s%20Arcadia">The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia</a>" (c. 1580). <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a> uses astrology both decoratively and causally in his poetry, revealing "...unmistakably an abiding interest in the art, an interest shared by a large number of his contemporaries." <a href="George%20Chapman">George Chapman's</a> play, "<a href="The%20Conspiracy%20and%20Tragedy%20of%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Byron">Byron's Conspiracy</a>" (1608), similarly uses astrology as a causal mechanism in the drama. <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare's</a> attitude towards astrology is unclear, with contradictory references in plays including "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", and "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>". Shakespeare was familiar with astrology and made use of his knowledge of astrology in nearly every play he wrote, assuming a basic familiarity with the subject in his commercial audience. Outside theatre, the physician and mystic <a href="Robert%20Fludd">Robert Fludd</a> practised astrology, as did the quack doctor Simon Forman. In Elizabethan England, "The usual feeling about astrology ... [was] that it is the most useful of the sciences."

In seventeenth century Spain, <a href="Lope%20de%20Vega">Lope de Vega</a>, with a detailed knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance "La Arcadia" (1598), it leads to absurdity; in his novela "Guzman el Bravo" (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man for the stars. <a href="Calder%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Barca">Calderón de la Barca</a> wrote the 1641 comedy "Astrologo Fingido" (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright <a href="Thomas%20Corneille">Thomas Corneille</a> for his 1651 comedy "Feint Astrologue".

The most famous piece of music influenced by astrology is the orchestral suite "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>". Written by the British composer <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a> (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of "The Planets" is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets. Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun. The composer <a href="Colin%20Matthews">Colin Matthews</a> wrote an eighth movement entitled "Pluto, the Renewer", first performed in 2000. In 1937, another British composer, <a href="Constant%20Lambert">Constant Lambert</a>, wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called "<a href="Horoscope%20%28ballet%29">Horoscope</a>". In 1974, the New Zealand composer <a href="Edwin%20Carr%20%28composer%29">Edwin Carr</a> wrote "The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment" for orchestra without strings. <a href="Camille%20Paglia">Camille Paglia</a> acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism "<a href="Sexual%20Personae">Sexual Personae</a>" (1990).

Astrology features strongly in <a href="Eleanor%20Catton">Eleanor Catton's</a> "<a href="The%20Luminaries">The Luminaries</a>", recipient of the <a href="2013%20Man%20Booker%20Prize">2013 Man Booker Prize</a>.

Algebraic extension

In <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, a <a href="field%20extension">field extension</a> "L"/"K" is called algebraic if every element of "L" is <a href="algebraic%20element">algebraic</a> over "K", i.e. if every element of "L" is a <a href="root%20of%20a%20function">root</a> of some non-zero <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a> with coefficients in "K". Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain <a href="transcendental%20element">transcendental element</a>s, are called transcendental.

For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s as an extension of the field of <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q(√2)/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s.

All transcendental extensions are of <a href="degree%20of%20a%20field%20extension">infinite degree</a>. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic. The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all <a href="algebraic%20number">algebraic number</a>s is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.

If "a" is algebraic over "K", then "K"["a"], the set of all polynomials in "a" with coefficients in "K", is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of "K" which has finite degree over "K". The converse is true as well, if "K"["a"] is a field, then "a" is algebraic over "K". In the special case where "K" = Q is the <a href="rational%20number">field of rational numbers</a>, Q["a"] is an example of an <a href="algebraic%20number%20field">algebraic number field</a>.

A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called <a href="algebraically%20closed%20field">algebraically closed</a>. An example is the field of <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its <a href="algebraic%20closure">algebraic closure</a>), but proving this in general requires some form of the <a href="axiom%20of%20choice">axiom of choice</a>.

An extension "L"/"K" is algebraic <a href="if%20and%20only%20if">if and only if</a> every sub "K"-algebra of "L" is a <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a>.

The class of algebraic extensions forms a <a href="distinguished%20class%20of%20field%20extensions">distinguished class of field extensions</a>, that is, the following three properties hold:

These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction: 

This fact, together with <a href="Zorn%27s%20lemma">Zorn's lemma</a> (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of <a href="algebraic%20closure">algebraic closure</a>s.

<a href="Model%20theory">Model theory</a> generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of "M" into "N" is called an algebraic extension if for every "x" in "N" there is a formula "p" with parameters in "M", such that "p"("x") is true and the set

is finite. It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension. The <a href="Galois%20group">Galois group</a> of "N" over "M" can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of Galois groups can be developed for the general case.

Ani DiFranco

Ani DiFranco (; born Angela Maria DiFranco; September 23, 1970) is an American singer, multi-instrumentalist, poet, songwriter and businesswoman. She has released more than 20 albums. DiFranco has received positive feedback from critics for much of her career.

Although DiFranco's music has been classified as <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a> and <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> she has added <a href="punk%20rock">punk</a>, <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="hip%20hop">hip hop</a> and <a href="jazz">jazz</a> influences. DiFranco created her own record label, <a href="Righteous%20Babe">Righteous Babe</a>, giving her significant creative freedom.

DiFranco supports many social and political movements by performing benefit concerts, appearing on benefit albums and speaking at rallies. Through the Righteous Babe Foundation DiFranco has backed grassroots cultural and political organizations supporting causes including abortion rights to gay visibility. She counts famed American folk singer and songwriter Pete Seeger among her mentors.

DiFranco was born in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>, the daughter of Elizabeth (Ross) and Dante Americo DiFranco, who had met while attending <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a>. Her father was of Italian descent, and her mother was from Montreal. DiFranco started playing <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatles</a> covers at local bars and <a href="busking">busking</a> with her guitar teacher, Michael Meldrum, at the age of nine. By 14 she was penning her own songs. She played them at bars and coffee houses throughout her teens. DiFranco graduated from the <a href="Buffalo%20Academy%20for%20Visual%20and%20Performing%20Arts">Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts</a> high school at 16 and began attending classes at <a href="Buffalo%20State%20College">Buffalo State College</a>. She was living alone, having moved out of her mother's apartment after she became an <a href="emancipated%20minor">emancipated minor</a> when she was 15.

DiFranco was only 18 when she started her own record company, <a href="Righteous%20Babe%20Records">Righteous Babe Records</a>, in 1989. She released her <a href="Ani%20DiFranco%20%28album%29">self-titled debut album</a> in the winter of 1990, shortly after relocating to New York City. There, she took poetry classes at <a href="The%20New%20School">The New School</a> where she met poet <a href="Sekou%20Sundiata">Sekou Sundiata</a> who was to become a friend and mentor. She toured steadily for the next 15 years, pausing only to record albums. Appearances at Canadian folk festivals and increasingly larger venues in the U.S. reflected her increasing popularity on the North American folk and roots scene.

In September 1995, DiFranco participated in a concert at the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in Cleveland Ohio, inaugurating the opening of the <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> Archives in New York City. She later released a CD on Righteous Babe of the concert entitled "Til We Outnumber Em" (featuring artists such as DiFranco, <a href="Billy%20Bragg">Billy Bragg</a>, <a href="Ramblin%27%20Jack%20Elliott">Ramblin' Jack Elliott</a>, <a href="Arlo%20Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a>, <a href="Indigo%20Girls">Indigo Girls</a>, <a href="Dave%20Pirner">Dave Pirner</a>, <a href="Tim%20Robbins">Tim Robbins</a>, and <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>) with 100% of proceeds going to the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum educational department.

DiFranco toured solo throughout the early and mid 1990s and also as a duo with Canadian drummer Andy Stochansky. Bassist <a href="Sara%20Lee%20%28musician%29">Sara Lee</a> joined the touring group in 1996. Their <a href="rapport">rapport</a> during live shows is showcased on the 1997 album "<a href="Living%20in%20Clip">Living in Clip</a>". DiFranco would later release Lee's solo album "Make It Beautiful" on Righteous Babe.

In 1998, Stochansky left to pursue a solo career as a singer-songwriter. A new touring ensemble consisting of Jason Mercer on bass, Julie Wolf on keyboards, and Daren Hahn on drums, augmented at times by a horn section, accompanied DiFranco on tour between 1998 and 2002.

The 1990s were a period of heightened exposure for DiFranco, as she continued playing ever larger venues around the world and attracted international attention of the press, including cover stories in "Spin, Ms., "and" Magnet, "among others, as well as appearances on MTV and VH1. Her playfully ironic cover of the Bacharach/David song "Wishin' and Hopin appeared under the opening titles of the film "<a href="My%20Best%20Friend%27s%20Wedding">My Best Friend's Wedding</a>".
She guest starred on an 1998 episode of the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> sitcom <a href="King%20of%20the%20Hill">King of the Hill</a>, as the voice of <a href="Peggy%20Hill">Peggy</a>'s feminist guitar teacher, Emily.
Beginning in 1999, Righteous Babe Records began releasing albums by other artists including Sekou Sundiata, Michael Meldrum, Arto Lindsay, Bitch and Animal, That One Guy, Utah Phillips, Hamell on Trial, <a href="Andrew%20Bird">Andrew Bird</a>, Kurt Swinghammer, Sara Lee, Buddy Wakefield, Anais Mitchell and Nona Hendryx.

On September 11, 2001, DiFranco was in Manhattan and later penned the poem "Self Evident" about the experience. The poem was featured in the book "It's a Free Country: Personal Freedom in America After September 11, "edited by Danny Goldberg, Victoria Goldberg, and Robert Greenwald. The poem's title also became the name of DiFranco's first book of poetry released exclusively in Italy by Minimum Fax. It was later featured in a book of her poetry published in the U.S. by Seven Stories press, entitled "Verses". DiFranco has written and performed many spoken-word pieces throughout her career and was showcased as a poet on the HBO series "Def Poetry" in 2005

Her father died early in the summer of 2004. In July 2005, DiFranco developed <a href="tendonitis">tendonitis</a> and took a nine-month hiatus from touring.

On September 11, 2007, she released the first retrospective of her career, a two disc compilation entitled "<a href="Canon%20%28album%29">Canon</a>" and simultaneously released a retrospective collection of poetry book "Verses". "<a href="Red%20Letter%20Year">Red Letter Year</a>" was released on September 30, 2008.
DiFranco performed a live webcast from <a href="Ex%27pression%20College%20for%20Digital%20Arts">Ex'pression College for Digital Arts</a> on June 24, 2010. She debuted a selection of new material, including the songs "Which Side Are You On?" (a reworking of the Florence Reece song with different lyrics penned by DiFranco), "Life Boat", "Unworry", "Promiscuity", "Splinter", "Amendment", "See See..." and "Hearse".

DiFranco's touring band and recordings have featured the bass player <a href="Todd%20Sickafoose">Todd Sickafoose</a> since her 2005 release "Knuckle Down "(co-produced by Joe Henry) and in turns other musicians such as <a href="Allison%20Miller%20%28drummer%29">Allison Miller</a>, Andy Borger, Herlin Riley, and Terence Higgins on drums and <a href="Mike%20Dillon%20%28musician%29">Mike Dillon</a> on percussion and vibes.

In 2009 DiFranco appeared at Pete Seeger's 90th birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden, debuting her revamped version of the 1930s labor anthem "Which Side Are You On?" in a duet with Bruce Cockburn and also duetting with Kris Kristofferson on the folk classic "There's a Hole in the Bucket".

DiFranco released an album of new material on January 17, 2012, titled "¿Which Side Are You On?". It includes collaborations with <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>, <a href="Ivan%20Neville">Ivan Neville</a>, <a href="Cyril%20Neville">Cyril Neville</a>, <a href="Skerik">Skerik</a>, <a href="Adam%20Levy">Adam Levy</a>, Righteous Babe recording artist <a href="Ana%C3%AFs%20Mitchell">Anaïs Mitchell</a>, <a href="CC%20Adcock">CC Adcock</a>, and a host of New Orleans-based horn players known for their work in such outfits as <a href="Galactic">Galactic</a>, <a href="Bonerama">Bonerama</a>, and <a href="Rebirth%20Brass%20Band">Rebirth Brass Band</a>.

DiFranco identifies herself as <a href="bisexual">bisexual</a>, and has written songs about love and sex with women and men. She addressed the controversy about her sexuality with the song "In or Out". In 1998, she married sound engineer Andrew Gilchrist in a <a href="Unitarian%20Universalist">Unitarian Universalist</a> service in Canada. DiFranco and Gilchrist divorced five years later.

DiFranco gave birth to a daughter, Petah Lucia DiFranco Napolitano, at her Buffalo home on January 20, 2007. She married the child's father, Mike Napolitano, also her regular producer, in 2009.

In an interview on September 13, 2012, DiFranco mentioned that she was pregnant with her second child. She gave birth to a second child, son Dante DiFranco Napolitano, on April 6, 2013.

DiFranco and her husband currently reside in the <a href="Bywater%2C%20New%20Orleans">Bywater</a> neighborhood of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>.

DiFranco has been a critical success for much of her career, though not a commercial one by major label standards, with a career album average of 72 on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. "Living in Clip", DiFranco's 1998 double live album, is the only one to achieve gold record status to date. DiFranco has been praised by the "Buffalo News" as the "Buffalo's leading lady of rock music".

Starting in 2003, DiFranco was nominated four consecutive times for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Recording%20Package">Best Recording Package</a> at the <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a>, winning in <a href="46th%20Grammy%20Awards">2004</a>, for "<a href="Evolve%20%28Ani%20DiFranco%20album%29">Evolve</a>".

On July 21, 2006, DiFranco received the <a href="Woman%20of%20Courage%20Award%20Winners">"Woman of Courage Award"</a> at the <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Women">National Organization for Women (NOW)</a> Conference and Young Feminist Summit in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany, New York</a>. Past winners have included singer and actress <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> and Sen. <a href="Barbara%20Boxer">Barbara Boxer</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Democratic%20Party">D</a>-<a href="California">Calif.</a> DiFranco is one of the first musicians to receive the award, given each year to a woman who has set herself apart by her contributions to the feminist movement.

In 2009, DiFranco became a Woody Guthrie Award recipient, as a voice of positive social change.

DiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature <a href="staccato">staccato</a> style, rapid <a href="fingerpicking">fingerpicking</a> and many alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include <a href="alliteration">alliteration</a>, <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>, <a href="word%20play">word play</a> and a more or less gentle <a href="irony">irony</a>, have also received praise for their sophistication.
Although DiFranco's music has been classified as both <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a> and <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, she has reached across genres since her earliest albums incorporating first punk, then funk, hiphop, and jazz influences.

While primarily an acoustic guitarist she has used a variety of <a href="musical%20instrument">instruments</a> and styles: <a href="brass%20instrument">brass instrument</a>ation was prevalent in 1998's "<a href="Little%20Plastic%20Castle">Little Plastic Castle</a>"; a simple <a href="walking%20bass">walking bass</a> in her 1997 cover of <a href="Hal%20David">Hal David</a> and <a href="Burt%20Bacharach">Burt Bacharach</a>'s "<a href="Wishin%27%20and%20Hopin%27">Wishin' and Hopin'</a> "; <a href="string%20instrument">strings</a> on the 1997 live album "<a href="Living%20in%20Clip">Living in Clip</a>" and 2004's "<a href="Knuckle%20Down">Knuckle Down</a>"; and electronics and synthesisers in 1999's "To the Teeth" and 2006's "<a href="Reprieve%20%28album%29">Reprieve</a>".

DiFranco herself noted that "folk music is not an acoustic guitar – that's not where the heart of it is. I use the word 'folk' in reference to <a href="Punk%20rock">punk music</a> and <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">rap music</a>. It's an attitude, it's an awareness of one's heritage, and it's a community. It's subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority."

DiFranco has also collaborated with a wide range of artists. In 1997 she appeared on Canadian songwriter <a href="Bruce%20Cockburn">Bruce Cockburn</a>'s "Charity of Night" album. In 1998 she produced fellow folksinger <a href="Dan%20Bern">Dan Bern</a>'s album "<a href="Fifty%20Eggs">Fifty Eggs</a>".

She developed a deep association with folksinger and social activist <a href="Utah%20Phillips">Utah Phillips</a> throughout the mid-1990s, sharing her stage and her audience with the older musician until his death in 2008 and resulting in two collaborative albums: "<a href="The%20Past%20Didn%27t%20Go%20Anywhere">The Past Didn't Go Anywhere</a>", 1996, and "<a href="Fellow%20Workers">Fellow Workers</a>",1999 (with liner notes by <a href="Howard%20Zinn">Howard Zinn</a>). "The Past" is built around Phillips's storytelling, an important part of his art that had not previously been documented on recordings; on the album, DiFranco provides musical settings for his speaking voice. The followup, "Fellow Workers", was recorded live in <a href="Daniel%20Lanois">Daniel Lanois</a>'s Kingsway Studio in New Orleans and features Phillips fronting DiFranco's touring band for a collection of songs and stories.

<a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> recorded two songs with DiFranco in 1999, "Providence" on her "To the Teeth" album, and "I Love U, But I Don't Trust U Anymore" on Prince's "<a href="Rave%20Un2%20the%20Joy%20Fantastic">Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic</a>" album. Funk and soul jazz musician <a href="Maceo%20Parker">Maceo Parker</a> and rapper Corey Parker have both appeared on DiFranco's albums and featured appearances by her on theirs. Parker and Di Franco toured together in 1999.

She has appeared on several compilations of the songs of <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a> and frequented his <a href="Clearwater%20Festival">Hudson Clearwater Revival Festival</a>. In 2001 she appeared on Brazilian artist <a href="Lenine%20%28musician%29">Lenine</a>'s album "Falange Canibal". In 2002 her rendition of <a href="Greg%20Brown%20%28folk%20musician%29">Greg Brown</a>'s "The Poet Game" appeared on "Going Driftless: An Artist’s Tribute to Greg Brown". Also in 2002 she recorded a duet with <a href="Jackie%20Chan">Jackie Chan</a> of the <a href="Irving%20Gordon">Irving Gordon</a> song "<a href="Unforgettable%20%28Irving%20Gordon%20song%29">Unforgettable</a>" for a record of unlikely collaborations entitled "When Pigs Fly: Songs You Never Thought You’d Hear".

In 2005 she appeared on <a href="Dar%20Williams">Dar Williams</a>' record "My Better Self", dueting on William's cover of <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "Comfortably Numb". She performed with <a href="Cyndi%20Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a> on "Sisters of Avalon" a track from Lauper's 2005 "<a href="The%20Body%20Acoustic">The Body Acoustic</a>" album. In 2006 she produced <a href="Hamell%20on%20Trial">Hamell on Trial</a>'s album "Songs for Parents Who Enjoy Drugs". In 2008 she appeared on <a href="Todd%20Sickafoose">Todd Sickafoose</a>'s album "Tiny Resisters". In 2010 she co-produced a track with <a href="Margaret%20Cho">Margaret Cho</a> called "Captain Cameltoe" for the comedian's "Cho Dependant" album. In 2011 she appeared on <a href="Rob%20Wasserman">Rob Wasserman</a>'s album "Note of Hope", an exploration of the writings of <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> with musical accompaniment, though the track in which she appeared, "Voice", was actually recorded 13 years earlier. Also in 2011 she duetted with <a href="Greg%20Dulli">Greg Dulli</a> on the <a href="Twilight%20Singers">Twilight Singers</a> record "Dynamite Steps".

Other artists have covered and sampled DiFranco's work throughout the years. Her spoken word poem "Self Evident" was covered by <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28group%29">Public Enemy</a> founder <a href="Chuck%20D">Chuck D</a>'s group called Impossebulls. <a href="Alana%20Davis">Alana Davis</a> had some commercial success with DiFranco's song <a href="32%20Flavors">32 Flavors</a>.

Samples from the track "Coming Up" were used by <a href="DJ%20Spooky">DJ Spooky</a> in his album "Live Without Dead Time", produced for <a href="AdBusters">AdBusters</a> Magazine in 2003.

Although much of DiFranco's material is autobiographical, it is often also strongly political. Many of her songs are concerned with contemporary social issues such as <a href="racism">racism</a>, <a href="sexism">sexism</a>, <a href="sexual%20abuse">sexual abuse</a>, <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a>, <a href="reproductive%20rights">reproductive rights</a>, poverty, and war. In 2008, she donated a song to <a href="Aid%20Still%20Required">Aid Still Required</a>'s CD to assist with the restoration of the devastation done to Southeast Asia from the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 tsunami</a>.
The combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, particularly those of the left wing, some of whom set up fan pages on the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">web</a> to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact and word of mouth rather than <a href="mainstream%20media">mainstream media</a>.

DiFranco has expressed political views outside of her music. During the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">2000 U.S. presidential election</a>, she actively supported and voted for <a href="Green%20Party%20%28US%29">Green Party</a> candidate <a href="Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</a>. She supported <a href="Dennis%20Kucinich">Dennis Kucinich</a> in the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202004">2004</a> and <a href="2008%20Democratic%20primaries">2008 Democratic primaries</a>. Kucinich appeared with her at a number of concerts across the country during both <a href="Primary%20election">primary seasons</a>. DiFranco went on to perform at the <a href="2008%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">2008 Democratic National Convention</a>.

DiFranco has described herself as an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>. On the subject of religion, DiFranco has stated:
Ani cites her anti-corporate ethos for the main reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a considerable degree of creative freedom over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track <a href="reel%20to%20reel">reel to reel</a>, and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album "<a href="Educated%20Guess">Educated Guess</a>". She has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including "The Million You Never Made" ("<a href="Not%20a%20Pretty%20Girl">Not a Pretty Girl</a>"), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, "The Next Big Thing" ("<a href="Not%20So%20Soft">Not So Soft</a>"), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and "Napoleon" ("<a href="Dilate%20%28Ani%20DiFranco%20album%29">Dilate</a>"), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.

The business grew organically starting in 1990 with the first cassette tape. Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes. Offers to play at colleges started coming in and her popularity grew largely by word of mouth and through women's groups or organizations. Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women's music, started carrying DiFranco's music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women's book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with <a href="Koch%20International">Koch International</a> for DiFranco's release of "Not a Pretty Girl". Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.

DiFranco has occasionally joined with <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. Righteous Babe Records employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo. In a 1997 open letter to "<a href="Ms.%20magazine">Ms. magazine</a>" she expressed displeasure that what she considers a way to ensure her own artistic freedom was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success.

From the earliest days of her career, Ani DiFranco has lent her voice and her name to a broad range of social movements, performing benefit concerts, appearing on benefit albums, speaking at rallies, and offering info table space to organizations at her concerts and the virtual equivalent on her website, among other methods and actions. In 1999 she created her own not-for-profit organization; as the Buffalo News has reported,"Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility."

During the first Gulf War, DiFranco participated in the anti-war movement. In the early 1993 she played Pete Seeger's Clearwater Folk Festival for the first time. In 1998 she was a featured performer in the Dead Man Walking benefit concert series raising money for Sister <a href="Helen%20Prejean">Helen Prejean</a>'s "Not in Our Name" anti-death penalty organization. DiFranco's commitment to opposing the death penalty is longstanding; she has also been a long time supporter of the <a href="Southern%20Center%20for%20Human%20Rights">Southern Center for Human Rights</a>.

In 2004 DiFranco visited Burma in order to learn about the Burmese resistance movement and the country's fight for democracy. During her travels she met with then-detained resistance leader <a href="Aung%20San%20Suu%20Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>. Her song "In The Way" was later featured on <a href="For%20the%20Lady">For the Lady</a>, a benefit CD that donated all proceeds to the United States Campaign for Burma.

On the home front, DiFranco has also been outspoken defender of democracy. During the 2004 presidential primaries, she openly and enthusiastically supported liberal, anti-war Democrat Dennis Kucinich. Congressman Kucinich appeared on stage with her at several concerts and she spoke positively about him from the stage at many more of her concerts. After the primary season ended, and Kerry was the clear Democratic candidate, DiFranco wrote an open letter of conditional support for independent candidate <a href="Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</a>. The same year she launched a "Vote, Dammit" tour of swing states encouraging audience members to register to vote. In 2005 she lobbied Congress against the proliferation of nuclear power in general and the placement of nuclear waste dumps on Indian land in particular. In 2008 she backed candidate Dennis Kucinich in his bid for the presidency.

In 2002 Righteous Babe Records established the "Aiding Buffalo's Children" program in conjunction with members of the local community to raise funds for Buffalo's imperiled public school system. To kick off the program, DiFranco donated "a day's pay"—the performance fee from her concert that year at Shea's Performing Arts Center— to ABC and challenged her fans to do the same. Aiding Buffalo's Children has since been folded into the Community Foundation of Greater Buffalo, contributing to a variety of charitable funds.

In 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated DiFranco's newly adopted home town of New Orleans she collected donations from fans around the world through The Righteous Babe Store website for the Katrina Piano Fund, helping musicians replace instruments lost in the hurricane, raising over $47,500 for the cause.

In 2010 when the BP Oil Spill crippled the Gulf she donated her talents to the "For Our Coast”benefit concert joining <a href="Marianne%20Faithfull">Marianne Faithfull</a>, <a href="C.C.%20Adcock">C.C. Adcock</a> and others at the Acadiana Center for the Arts Theater in Lafayette, raising money for Gulf Aid Acadiana, and the Gulf Aid show with <a href="Lenny%20Kravitz">Lenny Kravitz</a>, <a href="Mos%20Def">Mos Def</a>, and many more at Mardi Gras World River City in New Orleans, both shows raising money to help protect the wetlands, clean up the coast and to assist the fishermen and their families affected by the spill.

DiFranco also sits on the board for <a href="The%20Roots%20of%20Music">The Roots of Music</a>, founded by <a href="Rebirth%20Brass%20Band">Rebirth Brass Band</a> drummer <a href="Derrick%20Tabb">Derrick Tabb</a>. The organization fills a void in music education in New Orleans educational institutions by providing free Marching Band instruction to area children in addition to academic tutoring and mentoring.

DiFranco joined about 500,000 people at the March for Women's Lives in DC in April 2004 to voice her support for women's rights. As an honored guest she marched in the front row for the three-mile route, along with <a href="Margaret%20Cho">Margaret Cho</a>, <a href="Janeane%20Garofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a>, <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, <a href="Gloria%20Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a> and many others. Later in the day, Ani played a few songs on the main stage in front of the Capitol, including "Your Next Bold Move".

Scot Fisher, Righteous Babe label president and DiFranco's longtime manager, has been a longtime advocate of the preservation movement in Buffalo. In 1999 he and DiFranco purchased a decaying church on the verge of demolition in downtown Buffalo and began the lengthy process of restoring it. In 2006 the building opened its doors again, first briefly as "The Church" and then as "Babeville,” housing two concert venues, the record label's business office, and Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center.

In 2013 DiFranco was criticized on social media and faced "a great deal of outcry" after the announcement that she was hosting a three-day artists' workshop billed as the "Righteous Retreat" at <a href="Iberville%20Parish">Iberville Parish</a>'s <a href="Nottoway%20Plantation">Nottoway Plantation</a> in <a href="White%20Castle%2C%20Louisiana">White Castle, Louisiana</a>. Nottoway was one of the largest plantations in the South, and features the largest antebellum mansion. Its operator and founder John Randolph owned over 155 slaves in the year 1860. The grounds are now operated as a luxury resort. Critics charged that the resort's promotional material attempts to portray the plantation owner in a positive light, to downplay the suffering of the slaves, and to "sanitize" and "romanticize" the <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">history of slavery</a> for commercial gain. DiFranco's choice of venue for the retreat was called "a very blatant display of racism" on a petition at <a href="change.org">change.org</a> that collected more than 2,600 signatures.

On December 29, 2013 DiFranco issued a statement that she was cancelling the retreat, stating that "i am not unaware of the mechanism of white privilege or the fact that i need to listen more than talk when it comes to issues of race. if nottoway is simply not an acceptable place for me to go and try to do my work in the eyes of many, then let me just concede before more divisive words are spilled. ... i think many positive and life-affirming connections would have been made at this conference, in its all of its complexity of design. i do not wish to reinvent the righteous retreat at this point to eliminate the stay at the Nottoway Plantation. at this point I wish only to cancel." The singer's statements were called "remarkably unapologetic" on <a href="Jezebel%20%28website%29">Jezebel</a>, and "a variety of excuses and justifications" by <a href="Ebony%20%28magazine%29">Ebony</a>. Additionally, a piece at <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> said the announcement made "much of the idea that this was all a mistake, with no indication of remorse."

DiFranco issued an apology on January 2, 2014 following continued criticism. In it, she wrote "..i would like to say i am sincerely sorry. it is obvious to me now that you were right - all those who said we can't in good conscience go to that place and support it or look past for one moment what it deeply represents. i needed a wake up call and you gave it to me."

Arizona Diamondbacks

The Arizona Diamondbacks, often shortened as the D-backs, are an American <a href="professional%20baseball">professional baseball</a> franchise based in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. The club competes in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) as a member of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) <a href="National%20League%20West">West</a> division. Since the team's inception in 1998, the franchise has played home games at <a href="Chase%20Field">Chase Field</a>, formerly known as Bank One Ballpark. The Diamondbacks have won one <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> championship (in <a href="2001%20World%20Series">2001</a>), becoming the fastest <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a> in the Major Leagues to win a championship, doing it in only the fourth season since <a href="1998%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20expansion">the franchise's inception</a> in the <a href="1998%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1998 Major League Baseball season</a>.

On March 9, 1995, Arizona was <a href="1998%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20expansion">awarded a franchise</a> to begin play for the 1998 season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League. The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Colorado Rockies</a> on March 31, <a href="1998%20Arizona%20Diamondbacks%20season">1998</a>, at Bank One Ballpark. The <a href="Baseball%20park">ballpark</a> was renamed Chase Field in 2005, as a result of <a href="Bank%20One%20Corporation">Bank One Corporation</a>'s merger with <a href="JPMorgan%20Chase">JPMorgan Chase & Co.</a>

Since their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five <a href="National%20League%20West">National League West</a> titles, one National League Championship pennant, and the <a href="2001%20World%20Series">2001 World Series</a>.

The Diamondbacks' original colors were <a href="purple">purple</a>, <a href="black">black</a>, <a href="teal%20%28color%29">teal</a> and <a href="copper%20%28color%29">copper</a>. Their first logo was an italicized block letter "A" with a diamond pattern, and the crossbar represented by a snake's tongue. Prior to their inaugural season, they released their baseball caps. The home cap had a cream color crown with a purple visor and button. The road cap was black and had a turquoise visor and button. Their alternate cap had a turquoise crown with a purple visor and button. Depending on the cap, the "A" logo on the front of the cap had different color variations.

In the Diamondbacks' second season, they introduced a new logo which was a copper color snake in the shape of a letter "D". It was used on a solid black cap, which in the beginning, was worn as a road cap.

The franchise unveiled new uniforms and colors of Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black on November 8, 2006. The <a href="red">red</a> shade is named for the <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> <a href="canyon">canyon</a> at <a href="Red%20Rock%20State%20Park">Red Rock State Park</a> near <a href="Sedona%2C%20Arizona">Sedona</a>, while the <a href="beige">beige</a> (sand) shade is named for the <a href="Sonoran%20Desert">Sonoran Desert</a>. A sleeve patch was added featuring a lowercase "d" and "b" configured to look like a snake's head. The team also kept the "D" logo, but was slightly altered and put on an all red cap to be used as their game cap. They also kept the "A" logo with the new colors applied to it, with a solid black cap used as the alternate cap. A similar color scheme is currently used by the <a href="Arizona%20Coyotes">Arizona Coyotes</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a>.

Prior to the 2016 season, the Diamondbacks reincorporated teal into its color scheme while keeping Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black. They also unveiled eight different uniform combinations, including two separate home white and away grey uniforms. One major difference between the two sets is that the non-teal uniforms feature a snakeskin pattern on the shoulders, while the teal-trimmed uniforms include a charcoal/grey snakeskin pattern on the back. Arizona also kept the throwback pinstriped sleeveless uniforms from their 2001 championship season for use during Thursday home games.

The primary television play-by-play voice for the team's first nine seasons of play was <a href="Thom%20Brennaman">Thom Brennaman</a>, who also broadcasts baseball and <a href="college%20football">college football</a> games nationally for <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20Fox">Fox Television</a>. Brennaman was the TV announcer for the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> and <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> (along with his father <a href="Marty%20Brennaman">Marty Brennaman</a>) before being hired by Diamondbacks founder Jerry Colangelo in 1996, two years before the team would begin play.

In October 2006, Brennaman left the Diamondbacks to call games with his father for the Reds beginning in 2007, signing a four-year deal (his FOX duties remained unchanged).

The English language flagship radio station is <a href="KTAR%20%28AM%29">KTAR</a>. <a href="Greg%20Schulte">Greg Schulte</a> is the regular radio play-by-play voice, a 25-year veteran of sports radio in the Phoenix market, also well known for his previous work on <a href="Phoenix%20Suns">Phoenix Suns</a>, <a href="Arizona%20Cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a> and <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a> (ASU) broadcasts.

<a href="Jeff%20Munn">Jeff Munn</a> is a backup radio play-by-play announcer; he served as the regular public address announcer at <a href="Chase%20Field">Chase Field</a> in the early days of the franchise. He is well-known to many Phoenix area sports fans, having also served as the public address announcer for the Suns at America West Arena (now <a href="Talking%20Stick%20Resort%20Arena">Talking Stick Resort Arena</a>) in the 1990s. He is also the play-by-play radio voice for ASU women's basketball.

On November 1, 2006, the team announced that the TV voice of the <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> since 2002, <a href="Daron%20Sutton">Daron Sutton</a>, would be hired as the Diamondbacks primary TV play-by-play voice. Sutton was signed to a five-year contract with a team option for three more years. Sutton is considered one of the best of the younger generation of baseball broadcasters. His signature chants include "let's get some runs" when the D-backs trail in late innings. Sutton's father is <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> pitcher and current <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> broadcaster <a href="Don%20Sutton">Don Sutton</a>.

Former Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs first baseman <a href="Mark%20Grace">Mark Grace</a> and former Major League <a href="knuckleball">knuckleball</a> pitcher <a href="Tom%20Candiotti">Tom Candiotti</a> were the Diamondbacks primary color analysts for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Former Diamondbacks third baseman <a href="Matt%20Williams%20%28third%20baseman%29">Matt Williams</a> also did color commentary on occasion, as did former <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">Cardinals</a> and <a href="NBC">NBC</a> broadcast legend <a href="Joe%20Garagiola%2C%20Sr.">Joe Garagiola, Sr.</a>, a longtime Phoenix-area resident and father of <a href="Joe%20Garagiola%2C%20Jr.">Joe Garagiola, Jr.</a>, the first GM of the Diamondbacks (as head of the Maricopa County Sports Authority in the early 1990s, Garagiola, Jr. was one of the primary people involved in Phoenix obtaining a Major League Baseball franchise).

The Diamondbacks announced in July 2007 that for the 2008 season, all regionally broadcast Diamondbacks TV games will be shown exclusively on <a href="Fox%20Sports%20Arizona">Fox Sports Arizona</a>, and a few could possibly be shown on the national <a href="Fox%20Major%20League%20Baseball">Fox MLB</a> telecasts. Fox Sports Arizona (or FS Arizona) is currently seen in 2.8 million households in Arizona and New Mexico. The previous flagship station, since the inaugural 1998 season, was <a href="KTVK">KTVK</a>, a popular over-the-air independent station (and former longtime <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> affiliate) in Phoenix.

From 2009 to 2012, Mark Grace and Daron Sutton were tagged as the main broadcasters of the Diamondbacks with pre-game and postgame shows on Fox Sports Arizona, being hosted by former big-league closer <a href="Joe%20Borowski%20%28baseball%29">Joe Borowski</a>.

On June 21, 2012, Daron Sutton was suspended indefinitely, amid rumors of insubordination. Then on August 24, the team announced that Mark Grace had requested an indefinite leave of absence after being arrested for his second DUI in less than two years (Grace was later indicted on four DUI counts). For the remainder of the 2012 season, Sutton was replaced by Greg Schulte (Jeff Munn replaced Schulte on the radio broadcast) and Grace was replaced by Luis Gonzalez. At the end of the 2012 season, the team announced that neither Sutton nor Grace would be returning for the 2013 season.

On October 18, 2012, the team announced that <a href="Bob%20Brenly">Bob Brenly</a> would be returning as a broadcaster, and that he would be joined by then-<a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> personality <a href="Steve%20Berthiaume">Steve Berthiaume</a>.

The flagship Spanish language radio station is <a href="KBMB">KBMB</a> AM 710 with Miguel Quintana, Richard Saenz and Oscar Soria.

Games were televised in Spanish on <a href="KPHE-LD">KPHE-LP</a>—with Oscar Soria and Jerry Romo as the announcers—but this arrangement ended prior to the 2009 season due to the team switching fully to <a href="Fox%20Sports%20Arizona">Fox Sports Arizona</a> and the lack of carriage of KHPE-LP on the Cox cable system.

Aesthetics

Aesthetics ( or ; also spelled æsthetics and esthetics) is a branch of <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> that explores the nature of <a href="art">art</a>, <a href="beauty">beauty</a>, and <a href="taste%20%28sociology%29">taste</a>, with the creation and appreciation of beauty.

In its more technically epistemological perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and <a href="senses">sensori-emotional values</a>, sometimes called <a href="judgement">judgment</a>s of <a href="Feeling">sentiment</a> and taste. More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and <a href="nature">nature</a>". In <a href="modern%20English">modern English</a>, the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the <a href="Cubism">Cubist</a> aesthetic.

The word "aesthetic" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> ("aisthetikos", meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι ("aisthanomai", meaning "I perceive, feel, sense"). The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher <a href="Alexander%20Baumgarten">Alexander Baumgarten</a> in his dissertation "Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus" ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735,
even though his later definition in the fragment "Aesthetica" (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.

For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Hegel</a>, while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an <a href="art%20object">art object</a>), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an <a href="work%20of%20art">art work</a>.

Philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but has also to give a <a href="definition">definition</a> of what art is. Art is an <a href="autonomous">autonomous</a> entity for philosophy, because art deals with the <a href="senses">senses</a> (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as <a href="knowledge">knowledge</a> or art as action, but aesthetics is neither <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a> nor ethics.

Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. Aesthetics examines our affective domain response to an object or phenomenon.
<a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, writing in 1790, observes of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to "me"," because "Everyone has his own (<a href="sense">sense</a> of) <a href="taste">taste</a>". The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things."

Aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination. For <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind." (Essays Moral Political and Literary. Indianapolis, Literary Classics 5, 1987.) Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for <a href="pleasure">pleasure</a>. For <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a> "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but <a href="The%20Critique%20of%20Judgment">judging something</a> to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once.

Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to mass culture. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education. According to Kant in his book on the "<a href="Critique%20of%20Judgment">Critique of Judgment</a>", beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone. In the opinion of <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Tatarkiewicz">Władysław Tatarkiewicz</a>, there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in <a href="instinct">instinct</a>ual ways to <a href="facial%20expression">facial expression</a>s, and even behaviours like the <a href="gag%20reflex">gag reflex</a>. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither <a href="soup">soup</a> nor <a href="beard">beard</a>s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. Seeing a <a href="Sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> view of a landscape may give us a reaction of <a href="awe">awe</a>, which might manifest physically as an increased heart rate or widened eyes. These unconscious reactions may even be partly constitutive of what makes our judgment a judgment that the landscape is sublime.

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. <a href="Victorian%20Era">Victorians</a> in Britain often saw <a href="African%20sculpture">African sculpture</a> as ugly, but just a few decades later, <a href="Edwardian%20Era">Edwardian</a> audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to <a href="Human%20sexuality">sexual</a> desirability. Thus, judgments of <a href="Architectural%20design%20values">aesthetic value</a> can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or <a href="morality">moral</a> value. In a current context, one might judge a <a href="Lamborghini">Lamborghini</a> to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that <a href="free%20will">will</a> and <a href="Desire%20%28emotion%29">desire</a> were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet <a href="preference">preference</a> and <a href="choice">choice</a> have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by <a href="David%20Hume">Hume</a>, but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. We can call a person, a house, a symphony, a fragrance, and a <a href="mathematical%20proof">mathematical proof</a> beautiful. What characteristics do they share which give them that status? What possible feature could a proof and a fragrance both share in virtue of which they both count as beautiful? What makes a painting beautiful is quite different from what makes music beautiful, which suggests that each art form has its own language for the judgement of aesthetics.

At the same time, there is seemingly quite a lack of words to express oneself accurately when making an aesthetic judgment. An aesthetic judgment cannot be an empirical judgement. Therefore, due to impossibility for precision, there is confusion about what interpretations can be culturally negotiated. Due to imprecision in the standard English language, two completely different feelings experienced by two different people can be represented by an identical verbal expression. Wittgenstein stated this in his lectures on aesthetics and language games.

A collective identification of beauty, with willing participants in a given social spectrum, may be a socially negotiated phenomenon, discussed in a culture or context. Is there some underlying unity to aesthetic judgment and is there some way to articulate the similarities of a beautiful house, beautiful proof, and beautiful sunset? Defining it requires a description of the entire phenomenon, as Wittgenstein argued in his lectures on aesthetics. Likewise there has been long debate on how perception of beauty in the natural world, especially perception of the human form as beautiful, is supposed to relate to perceiving beauty in art or <a href="Cultural%20artefact">artefacts</a>. This goes back at least to Kant, with some echoes even in St. Bonaventure. 
The philosopher <a href="Denis%20Dutton">Denis Dutton</a> identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:


Artists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist <a href="Thomas%20Hirschhorn">Thomas Hirschhorn</a> deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonna</a> for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. "Rules of composition" that might be read into <a href="Duchamp">Duchamp</a>'s "<a href="Fountain%20%28Duchamp%29">Fountain</a>" or <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a>'s "<a href="4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3">4′33″</a>" do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.

Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. <a href="John%20Dewey">John Dewey</a> has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, <a href="James%20Page%20%28Australian%20educationist%29">James Page</a> has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for <a href="peace%20education">peace education</a>.

During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the <a href="New%20Criticism">New Criticism</a> school and debate concerning "the intentional fallacy". At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, <a href="W.%20K.%20Wimsatt">William K. Wimsatt</a> and <a href="Monroe%20Beardsley">Monroe Beardsley</a> published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "<a href="Intentional%20Fallacy">The Intentional Fallacy</a>", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an <a href="Authorial%20intentionality">author's intention</a>, or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "<a href="Affective%20fallacy">The Affective Fallacy</a>," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the <a href="reader-response">reader-response</a> school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, <a href="Stanley%20Fish">Stanley Fish</a>, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic." These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from <a href="Formalism%20%28art%29">formalists</a> stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote <a href="Richard%20Wollheim">Richard Wollheim</a> as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."

A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, <a href="Eli%20Siegel">Eli Siegel</a>, American philosopher and poet, founded <a href="Aesthetic%20Realism">Aesthetic Realism</a>, the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."

Various attempts have been made to define <a href="Post-Modern">Post-Modern</a> Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a>.

<a href="Benedetto%20Croce">Croce</a> suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. <a href="George%20Dickie%20%28philosopher%29">George Dickie</a> suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities. <a href="Marshall%20McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society. <a href="Theodor%20Adorno">Theodor Adorno</a> felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. <a href="Hal%20Foster%20%28art%20critic%29">Hal Foster</a> attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in "The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture". <a href="Arthur%20Danto">Arthur Danto</a> has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος "kallos"). <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Malraux">André Malraux</a> explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art. <a href="Brian%20Massumi">Brian Massumi</a> suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of <a href="Deleuze">Deleuze</a> and <a href="Guattari">Guattari</a>. Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. Dennis Dutton in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.

<a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lyotard">Jean-François Lyotard</a> re-invokes the Kantian distinction between <a href="taste%20%28sociology%29">taste</a> and the <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a>. Sublime painting, unlike <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a> <a href="realism%20%28visual%20arts%29">realism</a>, "... will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."

<a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> inaugurated aesthetical thinking in <a href="Psychoanalysis">Psychoanalysis</a> mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect. Following Freud and <a href="Merleau-Ponty">Merleau-Ponty</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Lacan">Jacques Lacan</a> theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.

The relation of <a href="Marxist%20aesthetics">Marxist aesthetics</a> to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.

<a href="Guy%20Sircello">Guy Sircello</a> has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty, love and sublimity. In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.

British philosopher and theorist of <a href="conceptual%20art">conceptual art</a> aesthetics, <a href="Peter%20Osborne%20%28writer%20and%20academic%29">Peter Osborne</a>, makes the point that "'<a href="post-conceptual%20art">post-conceptual art</a>' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of <a href="contemporary%20art">contemporary art</a> so much as the historical-<a href="ontological">ontological</a> condition for the production of contemporary art in general ...". Osborne noted that <a href="http%3A//www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%2520art%2520is%2520post-conceptual%2520art%2520/Leggi%2520il%2520testo%2520della%2520conferenza%2520di%2520Peter%2520Osborne%2520in%2520PDF.pdf">contemporary art is 'post-conceptual</a> in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s concept of alienation, and <a href="Louis%20Althusser">Louis Althusser</a>'s antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.

<a href="Gregory%20Loewen">Gregory Loewen</a> has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.

The field of <a href="experimental%20aesthetics">experimental aesthetics</a> was founded by <a href="Gustav%20Theodor%20Fechner">Gustav Theodor Fechner</a> in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a <a href="Subject%20%28philosophy%29">subject</a>-based, <a href="inductive%20reasoning">inductive</a> approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on <a href="experiment">experimental methods</a> is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art, music, or modern items such as websites or other IT products is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a>s. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of <a href="cognitive%20psychology">cognitive psychology</a> or <a href="neuroscience">neuroscience</a> (<a href="neuroaesthetics">neuroaesthetics</a>).

In the 1970s, <a href="Abraham%20Moles">Abraham Moles</a> and <a href="Frieder%20Nake">Frieder Nake</a> were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, <a href="information%20processing">information processing</a>, and <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>.

In the 1990s, <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Schmidhuber">Jürgen Schmidhuber</a> described an <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>ic theory of beauty which takes the <a href="subjectivity">subjectivity</a> of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data. This is closely related to the principles of <a href="algorithmic%20information%20theory">algorithmic information theory</a> and <a href="minimum%20description%20length">minimum description length</a>. One of his examples: <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their <a href="formal%20language">formal language</a>. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few <a href="bit">bit</a>s of information, drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>. Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's <a href="Beauty">beautiful</a> and what's <a href="interesting">interesting</a>, stating that interestingness corresponds to the <a href="first%20derivative">first derivative</a> of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the <a href="predictability">predictability</a> and <a href="compressibility">compressibility</a> of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and <a href="symmetries">symmetries</a> and <a href="fractal">fractal</a> <a href="self-similarity">self-similarity</a>. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive <a href="neural%20network">neural network</a>; see also <a href="Neuroesthetics">Neuroesthetics</a>) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer <a href="bit">bit</a>s than before, the temporary <a href="interest%20%28emotion%29">interest</a>ingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A <a href="reinforcement%20learning">reinforcement learning</a> algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional <a href="interesting">interesting</a> input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of <a href="Artificial%20intelligence">artificial</a> <a href="curiosity">curiosity</a>.

Mathematical considerations, such as <a href="symmetry">symmetry</a> and <a href="complexity">complexity</a>, are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of <a href="applied%20aesthetics">applied aesthetics</a> used in the study of <a href="mathematical%20beauty">mathematical beauty</a>. Aesthetic considerations such as <a href="symmetry">symmetry</a> and <a href="Occam%27s%20razor">simplicity</a> are used in areas of philosophy, such as <a href="Categorical%20imperative">ethics</a> and <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a> and <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> to <a href="define">define</a> <a href="truth">truth</a>, outside of <a href="empirical">empirical</a> considerations. Beauty and <a href="Truth">Truth</a> have been argued to be nearly synonymous, as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem <a href="Ode%20on%20a%20Grecian%20Urn">Ode on a Grecian Urn</a> by <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>, or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by <a href="processing%20fluency">processing fluency</a>, which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth. Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks. However, scientists including the mathematician <a href="David%20Orrell">David Orrell</a> and physicist <a href="Marcelo%20Gleiser">Marcelo Gleiser</a> have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.

Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images. Typically, these approaches follow a <a href="machine%20learning">machine learning</a> approach, where large numbers of manually rated photographs are used to "teach" a computer about what visual properties are of relevance to aesthetic quality. The Acquine engine, developed at <a href="Penn%20State%20University">Penn State University</a>, rates natural photographs uploaded by users.

Notable in this area is Michael Leyton, professor of psychology at Rutgers University. Leyton is the president of the International Society for Mathematical and Computational Aesthetics and the
International Society for <a href="Group%20Theory">Group Theory</a> in Cognitive Science and has developed a generative theory of shape.

There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess and music. A relation between <a href="Max%20Bense">Max Bense</a>'s mathematical formulation of aesthetics in terms of "redundancy" and "complexity" and theories of musical anticipation was offered using the notion of Information Rate.

Evolutionary aesthetics refers to <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of "<a href="Homo%20sapiens">Homo sapiens</a>" are argued to have <a href="evolution">evolved</a> in order to enhance survival and reproductive success. One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer <a href="landscape">landscape</a>s which were good <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of <a href="physical%20attractiveness">physical attractiveness</a> which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of <a href="evolutionary%20musicology">evolutionary musicology</a>, <a href="Darwinian%20literary%20studies">Darwinian literary studies</a>, and the study of the <a href="evolution%20of%20emotion">evolution of emotion</a>.

As well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects such as crucifix or tools. Aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency This coupling was made to reinforce the learning paradigm when English-language speakers used translators to address audiences in their own country. These audiences were generally not fluent in the English language. It can also be used in topics as diverse as <a href="Mathematical%20beauty">mathematics</a>, <a href="gastronomy">gastronomy</a>, fashion and website design.

The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. <a href="Raymond%20Williams">Raymond Williams</a> argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By "art" we may frame several artistic "works" or "creations" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible "art" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as "art".

<a href="Pierre%20Bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a> disagrees with Kant's idea of the "aesthetic". He argues that Kant's "aesthetic" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid "aesthetic" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.

Timothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics "framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices".

Ark of the Covenant

The Ark of the Covenant (), also known as the Ark of the Testimony, is a gold-covered wooden chest with lid cover described in the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a> as containing the two <a href="Tablets%20of%20Stone">stone tablets</a> of the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>. According to various texts within the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, it also contained <a href="Aaron%27s%20rod">Aaron's rod</a> and a pot of <a href="manna">manna</a>.

The biblical account relates that, approximately one year after the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a>' <a href="The%20Exodus">exodus from Egypt</a>, the Ark was created according to the pattern given to <a href="Moses">Moses</a> by God when the Israelites were encamped at the foot of <a href="biblical%20Mount%20Sinai">biblical Mount Sinai</a>. Thereafter, the gold-plated <a href="Acacia%20%28Vachellia%29">acacia</a> chest was carried by its staves while en route by the <a href="Levite">Levite</a>s approximately 2,000 <a href="cubit">cubit</a>s (approximately ) in advance of the people when on the march or before the Israelite army, the host of fighting men. When carried, the Ark was always hidden under a large veil made of skins and blue cloth, always carefully concealed, even from the eyes of the <a href="Kohen">priests</a> and the Levites who carried it. God was said to have spoken with Moses "from between the two <a href="cherub">cherub</a>im" on the Ark's cover. When at rest the tabernacle was set up and the holy Ark was placed under the veil of the covering the staves of it crossing the middle side bars to hold it up off the ground.

Beside the classic Ark of the Covenant made of wood and gold plated described in Exodus, there is a second and less known ark described only in Deuteronomy 10:3-5. This modest ark is made of acacia wood. Researchers do not know whether both arks belong to the same tradition, an older and a more recent, or belong to two different traditions. 

According to the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a>, God instructed <a href="Moses">Moses</a> on <a href="Biblical%20Mount%20Sinai">Mount Sinai</a> during his 40-day stay upon the mountain within the thick cloud and darkness where God was and he was shown the pattern for the tabernacle and furnishings of the Ark to be made of <a href="shittim%20wood">shittim wood</a> to house the <a href="Tablets%20of%20Stone">Tablets of Stone</a>. Moses instructed <a href="Bezalel">Bezalel</a> and <a href="Oholiab">Oholiab</a> to construct the Ark. In <a href="Book%20of%20Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>, however, the Ark is said to have been built specifically by Moses himself without reference of Bezalel or Oholiab.

The Book of Exodus gives detailed instructions on how the Ark is to be constructed. It is to be 2½ <a href="cubit">cubit</a>s in length, 1½ in breadth, and 1½ in height (approximately ). Then it is to be gilded entirely with <a href="gold">gold</a>, and a crown or molding of gold is to be put around it. Four rings of gold are to be attached to its four corners, two on each side—and through these rings staves of shittim-wood overlaid with gold for carrying the Ark are to be inserted; and these are not to be removed. A golden lid, the "<a href="Mercy%20seat">kapporet</a>" (traditionally "mercy seat" in Christian translations) which is covered with 2 golden <a href="cherub">cherub</a>im, is to be placed above the Ark. Instructions missing from the biblical account include the thickness of the mercy seat, but instruct that the cherubim cover be beaten out the ends of it and details concerning the cherubim except that they form the space that God will appear. The Ark is finally to be placed under the veil of the covering.

The biblical account continues that, after its creation by Moses, the Ark was carried by the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> during their 40 years of wandering in the desert. Whenever the Israelites camped, the Ark was placed in a separate room in a sacred <a href="tent">tent</a>, called the <a href="Tabernacle">Tabernacle</a>.

When the Israelites, led by <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a> toward the Promised Land, arrived at the banks of the <a href="Jordan%20river">Jordan river</a>, the Ark was carried in the lead preceding the people and was the signal for their advance (Joshua 3:3, 6). During the crossing, the river grew dry as soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touched its waters, and remained so until the priests—with the Ark—left the river after the people had passed over (Josh. 3:15-17; 4:10, 11, 18). As memorials, <a href="Twelve%20Stones">twelve stones</a> were taken from the Jordan at the place where the priests had stood (Josh. 4:1-9).

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jericho">Battle of Jericho</a>, the Ark was carried round the city once a day for seven days, preceded by the armed men and seven priests sounding seven trumpets of rams' horns (Josh. 6:4-15). On the seventh day, the seven priests sounding the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark compassed the city seven times and, with a great shout, Jericho's wall fell down flat and the people took the city (Josh. 6:16-20). After the defeat at <a href="Ai%20%28Bible%29">Ai</a>, Joshua lamented before the Ark (Josh. 7:6-9). When Joshua read the Law to the people between <a href="Mount%20Gerizim">Mount Gerizim</a> and <a href="Mount%20Ebal">Mount Ebal</a>, they stood on each side of the Ark. We next hear of the Ark in <a href="Bethel">Bethel</a> where it was being cared for by the priest <a href="Phineas">Phineas</a> the grandson of <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a> (Judges 20:26f, where 'Bethel' is translated 'the House of God' in the King James Version). According to this verse it was consulted by the people of Israel when they were planning to attack the Benjaminites at the <a href="battle%20of%20Gibeah">battle of Gibeah</a>. Later, however, the Ark was kept at <a href="Shiloh%20%28biblical%20city%29">Shiloh</a>, another religious centre some 10 miles north of Bethel, at the time of the prophet <a href="Samuel">Samuel</a>'s apprenticeship (1 Samuel 3:3), where it was cared for by <a href="Hophni%20and%20Phinehas">Hophni and Phinehas</a>, two sons of <a href="Eli%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Eli</a> (1 Samuel 4:3f).

A few years later the elders of Israel decided to take the Ark out onto the battlefield to assist them against the <a href="Philistines">Philistines</a>, after being defeated at the battle of <a href="Eben-Ezer">Eben-Ezer</a> (1 Sam. 4:3-11). They were, however, heavily defeated with the loss of 30,000 men. The Ark was captured by the Philistines and Hophni and Phinehas were killed. The news of its capture was at once taken to Shiloh by a messenger "with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head." The old priest, Eli, fell dead when he heard it; and his daughter-in-law, bearing a son at the time the news of the capture of the Ark was received, named him <a href="Ichabod">Ichabod</a> — explained as "The glory has departed Israel" in reference to the loss of the Ark (1 Sam. 4:12-22). The mother of the child Ichabod died at his birth. (1 Sam. 4:20)

The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune befell them (1 Sam. 5:1-6). At <a href="Ashdod">Ashdod</a> it was placed in the temple of <a href="Dagon">Dagon</a>. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate, bowed down, before it; and on being restored to his place, he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with <a href="hemorrhoids">hemorrhoids</a>; a plague of mice was sent over the land (1 Sam. 6:5). The affliction of boils was also visited upon the people of <a href="Gath%20%28city%29">Gath</a> and of <a href="Ekron">Ekron</a>, whither the Ark was successively removed (1 Sam. 5:8-12).

After the Ark had been among them for seven months, the Philistines, on the advice of their diviners, returned it to the Israelites, accompanying its return with an offering consisting of golden images of the tumors and mice wherewith they had been afflicted. The Ark was set up in the field of Joshua the <a href="Beth-shemesh">Beth-shemite</a>, and the Beth-shemites offered sacrifices and burnt offerings (1 Sam. 6:1-15). Out of curiosity the men of <a href="Beth-shemesh">Beth-shemesh</a> gazed at the Ark; and as a punishment, seventy of them (fifty thousand and seventy in some translations) were smitten by the Lord (1 Samuel 6:19). The Bethshemites sent to <a href="Kirjath-jearim">Kirjath-jearim</a>, or Baal-Judah, to have the Ark removed (1 Samuel 6:21); and it was taken to the house of <a href="Abinadab">Abinadab</a>, whose son <a href="Eleazar%20%28son%20of%20Aminadab%29">Eleazar</a> was sanctified to keep it. Kirjath-jearim remained the abode of the Ark for twenty years. Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle. In <a href="Books%20of%20Chronicles">1 Chronicles</a> 13:3 it is stated that the people were not accustomed to consulting the Ark in the days of <a href="Saul">Saul</a>.

At the beginning of his reign over the <a href="United%20Monarchy%20of%20Israel">United Monarchy</a>, King <a href="David">David</a> removed the Ark from <a href="Kirjath-jearim">Kirjath-jearim</a> amid great rejoicing. On the way to <a href="Zion">Zion</a>, <a href="Uzzah">Uzzah</a>, one of the drivers of the cart that carried the Ark, put out his hand to steady the Ark, and was struck dead by God for touching it. The place was subsequently named "<a href="Perez-uzzah">Perez-Uzzah</a>", literally "Outburst Against Uzzah", as a result. David, in fear, carried the Ark aside into the house of <a href="Obed-edom">Obed-edom</a> the <a href="Gath%20%28city%29">Gittite</a>, instead of carrying it on to Zion, and there it stayed three months (2 Samuel 6:1-11; 1 Chronicles 13:1-13).

On hearing that God had blessed Obed-edom because of the presence of the Ark in his house, David had the Ark brought to Zion by the Levites, while he himself, "girded with a linen <a href="ephod">ephod</a> ... danced before the Lord with all his might" and in the sight of all the public gathered in Jerusalem - a performance that caused him to be scornfully rebuked by his first wife, Saul's daughter <a href="Michal">Michal</a> (2 Sam. 6:12-16, 20-22; 1 Chron. 15). In Zion, David put the Ark in the tabernacle he had prepared for it, offered sacrifices, distributed food, and blessed the people and his own household (2 Sam. 6:17-20; 1 Chron. 16:1-3; 2 Chron. 1:4).

The Levites were appointed to minister before the Ark (1 Chron. 16:4). David's plan of building a temple for the Ark was stopped at the advice of God (2 Sam. 7:1-17; 1 Chron. 17:1-15; 28:2, 3). The Ark was with the army during the siege of <a href="Rabbah">Rabbah</a> (2 Sam. 11:11); and when David fled from Jerusalem at the time of <a href="Absalom">Absalom</a>'s conspiracy, the Ark was carried along with him until he ordered <a href="Zadok%20%28High%20Priest%29">Zadok</a> the priest to return it to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 15:24-29).

When <a href="Abiathar">Abiathar</a> was dismissed from the priesthood by King <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a> for having taken part in <a href="Adonijah">Adonijah</a>'s <a href="conspiracy%20%28political%29">conspiracy</a> against David, his life was spared because he had formerly borne the Ark (1 Kings 2:26). Solomon worshipped before the Ark after his dream in which God promised him wisdom (1 Kings 3:15).

During the construction of <a href="Solomon%27s%20Temple">Solomon's Temple</a>, a special inner room, named "<a href="Kodesh%20Hakodashim">Kodesh Hakodashim</a>" (Eng. <a href="Holy%20of%20Holies">Holy of Holies</a>), was prepared to receive and house the Ark (1 Kings 6:19); and when the Temple was dedicated, the Ark—containing the original <a href="Tablets%20of%20Stone">tablets</a> of the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>—was placed therein (1 Kings 8:6-9). When the priests emerged from the holy place after placing the Ark there, the Temple was filled with a cloud, "for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord" (1 Kings 8:10-11; 2 Chron. 5:13, 14).

When Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, he caused her to dwell in a house outside <a href="Zion">Zion</a>, as Zion was consecrated because of its containing the Ark (2 Chron. 8:11). King Josiah also had the Ark returned to the Temple (2 Chron. 35:3), from which it appears to have been removed by one of his predecessors (cf. 2 Chron. 33-34 and 2 Kings 21-23).

In 587 BC, the <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>ns <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28587%20BC%29">destroyed Jerusalem</a> and Solomon's Temple. There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles. An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, <a href="1%20Esdras">1 Esdras</a>, suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:
In <a href="Rabbinic%20literature">Rabbinic literature</a>, the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back. A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the "<a href="Tosefta">Tosefta</a>" states the opinions of these rabbis that <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a>, the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of <a href="manna">manna</a>, and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines. This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.

The Ark is first mentioned in the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a>, and then numerous times in <a href="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Joshua">Joshua</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Judges">Judges</a>, <a href="I%20Samuel">I Samuel</a>, <a href="II%20Samuel">II Samuel</a>, <a href="I%20Kings">I Kings</a>, <a href="I%20Chronicles">I Chronicles</a>, <a href="II%20Chronicles">II Chronicles</a>, <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a> and <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>.

In the <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Book of Jeremiah</a>, it is referenced by <a href="Jeremiah%20%28prophet%29">Jeremiah</a>, who, speaking in the days of <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> (Jer. 3:16), prophesied a future time, possibly the <a href="Jewish%20eschatology">end of days</a>, when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made again:

<a href="Rashi">Rashi</a> comments on this verse that "The entire people will be so imbued with the spirit of sanctity that God's Presence will rest upon them collectively, as if the congregation itself was the Ark of the Covenant."

According to <a href="Second%20Maccabees">Second Maccabees</a>, at the beginning of chapter 2:

The "mountain from the top of which Moses saw God's promised land" would be <a href="Mount%20Nebo">Mount Nebo</a>, located in what is now <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>.

Chapter 2 ("Sura" 2) of the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> (Verse 248), is believed to refer to the Ark:

And their prophet said to them, "Indeed, a sign of his kingship is that the chest ("tābūt") will come to you in which is assurance ("sakīnatun") from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses ("Mūsā") and the family of Aaron ("Hārūn") had left, carried by the angels. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers."

The Arabic word "<a href="Sakina">sakīna</a>" (variously translated "peace of reassurance" or "spirit of tranquility") is related to the post-Biblical Hebrew <a href="shekhinah">shekhinah</a>, meaning "dwelling or presence of God".

The Islamic scholar <a href="Baidawi">Al Baidawi</a> mentioned that the "sakina" could be <a href="Tawrat">Tawrat</a>, the Books of Moses. According to Al-Jalalan, the relics in the Ark were the fragments of the two tablets, rods, robes, shoes, mitres of Moses and the vase of manna. Al-Tha'alibi, in "<a href="Qisas%20Al-Anbiya">Qisas Al-Anbiya</a>" (The Stories of the Prophets), has given an earlier and later history of the Ark.

According to <a href="Uri%20Rubin">Uri Rubin</a> the Ark of the Covenant has a religious basis in Islam, and Islam gives it special significance.

Since its disappearance from the Biblical narrative, there have been a number of claims of having discovered or of having possession of the Ark, and several possible places have been suggested for its location.

<a href="2%20Maccabees">2 Maccabees</a> 2:4-10, written around 100 BC, says that the prophet <a href="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>, "being warned by God" before the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28587%20BC%29">Babylonian invasion</a>, took the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense, and buried them in a cave on <a href="Mount%20Nebo">Mount Nebo</a>, informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown "until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy."
Mount Nebo is also described in the Bible (Deuteronomy 34) as the site from which Moses views the <a href="Promised%20Land">Promised Land</a>, and apparently also is his final burial place. Mount Nebo is approximately 47 km (29 miles) slightly south of due east from Jerusalem, near the east bank of the Jordan River.

The <a href="Ethiopian%20Orthodox%20Tewahedo%20Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant, or "<a href="Tabot">Tabot</a>", in <a href="Axum%2C%20Ethiopia">Axum</a>. The object is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the <a href="Church%20of%20Our%20Lady%20Mary%20of%20Zion">Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion</a>. Replicas of the Axum "tabot" are kept in every Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo church, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Mary, George and Michael.

The "<a href="Kebra%20Nagast">Kebra Nagast</a>" was composed to legitimise the <a href="Solomonic%20dynasty">Solomonic dynasty</a>, which ruled the <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Ethiopian Empire</a> following its establishment in 1270. It narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by <a href="Menelik%20I">Menelik I</a> with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the "Kebra Nagast" is the best-known account of this belief, it predates the document. <a href="Abu%20al-Makarim">Abu al-Makarim</a>, writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. "The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant", he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, "on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross."

In his 1992 book "<a href="The%20Sign%20and%20the%20Seal">The Sign and the Seal</a>", British writer <a href="Graham%20Hancock">Graham Hancock</a> suggests, contrary to the "Kebra Nagast", that the ark spent several years in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> before it came to Ethiopia via the <a href="Nile%20River">Nile River</a>, where it was kept in the islands of <a href="Lake%20Tana">Lake Tana</a> for about four hundred years and finally taken to Axum. Archaeologist John Holladay of the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> called Hancock's theory "garbage and hogwash," while <a href="Edward%20Ullendorff">Edward Ullendorff</a>, a former Professor of Ethiopian Studies at the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>, said he "wasted a lot of time reading it."

On 25 June 2009, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia, <a href="Abune%20Paulos">Abune Paulos</a>, said he would announce to the world the next day the unveiling of the Ark of the Covenant, which he said had been kept safe and secure in a church in Axum, Ethiopia. The following day, on 26 June 2009, the patriarch announced that he would not unveil the Ark after all, but that instead he could attest to its current status.

The <a href="Lemba%20people">Lemba people</a> of South Africa and Zimbabwe have claimed that their ancestors carried the Ark south, calling it the "<a href="ngoma%20lungundu">ngoma lungundu</a>" or "voice of God", eventually hiding it in a deep cave in the Dumghe mountains, their spiritual home.

On 14 April 2008, in a UK <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> documentary, <a href="Tudor%20Parfitt">Tudor Parfitt</a>, taking a literalist approach to the Biblical story, described his research into this claim. He says that the object described by the Lemba has attributes similar to the Ark. It was of similar size, was carried on poles by priests, was not allowed to touch the ground, was revered as a voice of their God, and was used as a weapon of great power, sweeping enemies aside.

In his book "The Lost Ark of the Covenant" (2008), Parfitt also suggests that the Ark was taken to Arabia following the events depicted in the <a href="Second%20Book%20of%20Maccabees">Second Book of Maccabees</a>, and cites Arabic sources which maintain it was brought in distant times to <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>. One Lemba clan, the Buba, which was supposed to have brought the Ark to Africa, have a genetic signature called the <a href="Cohen%20Modal%20Haplotype">Cohen Modal Haplotype</a>. This suggests a male Semitic link to the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. Lemba tradition maintains that the Ark spent some time in <a href="Sena%2C%20Yemen">Sena</a> in Yemen. Later, it was taken across the sea to East Africa and may have been taken inland at the time of the <a href="Great%20Zimbabwe%20civilization">Great Zimbabwe civilization</a>. According to their oral traditions, some time after the arrival of the Lemba with the Ark, it self-destructed. Using a core from the original, the Lemba priests constructed a new one. This replica was discovered in a cave by a <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> <a href="Germany">German</a> missionary named Harald von Sicard in the 1940s and eventually found its way to the Museum of Human Science in <a href="Harare">Harare</a>. Parfitt had this artifact radio-<a href="carbon%20dating">carbon dated</a> to about 1350, which coincided with the sudden end of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Zimbabwe">Great Zimbabwe civilization</a>.

French author Louis Charpentier claimed that the Ark was taken to the <a href="Chartres%20Cathedral">Chartres Cathedral</a> by the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>.

One author has theorised that the Ark was taken from Jerusalem to the village of <a href="Rennes-le-Ch%C3%A2teau">Rennes-le-Château</a> in Southern France. Karen Ralls has cited Freemason Patrick Byrne, who believes the Ark was moved from Rennes-le-Château at the outbreak of World War I to the United States.

The Ark of the Covenant was said to have been kept in the <a href="Basilica%20of%20St.%20John%20Lateran">Basilica of St. John Lateran</a>, surviving the pillages of Rome by <a href="Genseric">Genseric</a> and <a href="Alaric%20I">Alaric I</a> but lost when the basilica burned.

"Rabbi <a href="Eliezer%20ben%20Jos%C3%A9">Eliezer ben José</a> stated that he saw in Rome the <a href="mercy-seat">mercy-seat</a> of the temple. There was a bloodstain on it. On inquiry he was told that it was a stain from the blood which the high priest sprinkled thereon on the <a href="Day%20of%20Atonement">Day of Atonement</a>."

In 2003, author <a href="Graham%20Phillips%20%28author%29">Graham Phillips</a> hypothetically concluded that the Ark was taken to <a href="Biblical%20Mount%20Sinai">Mount Sinai</a> in the Valley of <a href="Edom">Edom</a> by the <a href="Maccabees">Maccabees</a>. Phillips claims it remained there until the 1180s, when <a href="Ralph%20de%20Sudeley">Ralph de Sudeley</a>, the leader of the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Templars</a> found the Maccabean treasure at <a href="Jebel%20al-Madhbah">Jebel al-Madhbah</a>, and returned home to his estate at Herdewyke in <a href="Warwickshire%2C%20England">Warwickshire, England</a> taking the treasure with him.

During the turn of the 20th century <a href="British%20Israelism">British Israelites</a> carried out some excavations of the <a href="Hill%20of%20Tara">Hill of Tara</a> in <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> looking for the Ark of the Covenant—the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Antiquaries%20of%20Ireland">Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland</a> campaigned successfully to have them stopped before they destroyed the hill.

In 1922 in the <a href="Valley%20of%20the%20Kings">Valley of the Kings</a> in Egypt, the royal tomb of the <a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a> (<a href="KV62">KV62</a>) was opened by <a href="Howard%20Carter">Howard Carter</a> and <a href="Lord%20Carnarvon">Lord Carnarvon</a>. Among the artifacts was a processional ark, listed as Shrine 261, the <a href="Anubis%20Shrine">Anubis Shrine</a>. Almost immediately after publication of the photographs of this sensational archaeological find, some claimed that the Anubis Shrine could be the Ark of the Covenant. John M. Lundquist, author of "The Temple of Jerusalem: Past, Present, and Future" (2008), discounts this idea. The Anubis Shrine measures long, wide, and high in the shape of a <a href="pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a>. The Biblical Ark of the Covenant is approximately long, wide, and high in the shape of a rectangular <a href="chest%20%28furniture%29">chest</a>.

Lundquist observes that the Anubis Shrine is not strictly analogous to the Ark of the Covenant; it can only be said that the it is "ark-like", constructed of wood, <a href="gesso">gesso</a>ed and gilded, stored within a sacred tomb, "guarding" the treasury of the tomb (and not the primary focus of that environment), that it contains compartments within it that store and hold sacred objects, that it has a figure of Anubis on its lid, and that it was carried by two staves permanently inserted into rings at its base and borne by eight priests in the funerary procession to Tutankhamun's tomb. Its value is the insight it provides to the ancient culture of Egypt.

The Ark of the Covenant is the main plot device in <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s 1981 <a href="adventure%20film">adventure film</a> "<a href="Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>," which depicts it as located by <a href="Indiana%20Jones">Indiana Jones</a> in the <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian city of <a href="Tanis">Tanis</a> in 1936. It is mentioned briefly in "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>" (1989) and appears in a <a href="Cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> in "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Skull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>" (2008).

In the Danish family film "<a href="The%20Lost%20Treasure%20of%20the%20Knights%20Templar">The Lost Treasure of the Knights Templar</a>" from 2006, the main part of the treasure found in the end is the Ark of the Covenant. The power of the Ark comes from charged static electricity from different metal plates like a giant battery.

Angles

The Angles () were one of the main <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a> who settled in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> in the <a href="Fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire">post-Roman</a> period. They founded several of the <a href="monarchy">kingdoms</a> of <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a>, and their name is the root of the name "England". The name comes from the district of <a href="Angeln">Angeln</a>, an area located on the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> shore of what is now <a href="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>.

The name of the Angles may have been first recorded in Latinised form, as "Anglii", in the "<a href="Germania%20%28book%29">Germania</a>" of <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>. It is thought to derive from the name of the area they originally inhabited: "Angeln" in modern German, "Angel" in <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a>. This name has been hypothesised to originate from the <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic</a> root for "narrow" (compare German and Dutch "eng" = "narrow"), meaning "the Narrow [Water]", i.e. the <a href="Schlei">Schlei</a> <a href="estuary">estuary</a>; the root would be angh, "tight". Another theory is that the name meant "hook", as in <a href="angling">angling</a> for fish; Indo-European linguist <a href="Julius%20Pokorny">Julius Pokorny</a> derives it from *ang-, "bend" (see ankle). 

During the <a href="9th%20century">9th century</a>, all invading Germanic tribes were referred to as "Englisc", who were speakers of <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> (which was known as "Englisc", "Ænglisc" or "Anglisc"). "Englisc" also goes back to Proto-Indo-European "*h₂enǵʰ-", meaning 'narrow'. In any case, the Angles may have been called such because they were a <a href="fishing">fishing</a> people or were originally descended from such, and therefore <a href="England">England</a> would mean 'land of the <a href="fishermen">fishermen</a>', and <a href="English%20language">English</a> would be 'the fishermen's language'.

<a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a> in an <a href="epistle">epistle</a> simplified the Latinised name "Anglii" to "Angli", the latter form developing into the preferred form of the word. The country remained "Anglia" in Latin. <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>'s translation of <a href="Paulus%20Orosius">Orosius</a>' history of the world uses "Angelcynn" (-kin) to describe England and the English people; <a href="Bede">Bede</a> used "Angelfolc" (-folk); there are also such forms as "Engel", "Englan" (the people), "Englaland", and "Englisc", all showing <a href="i-mutation">i-mutation</a>.

The earliest recorded mention of the Angles may be in chapter 40 of <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>'s "<a href="Germania%20%28book%29">Germania</a>" written around AD 98. Tacitus describes the "Anglii" as one of the more remote <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>c tribes compared to the <a href="Semnones">Semnones</a> and <a href="Langobardi">Langobardi</a>, who lived on the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> and were better known to the Romans. He grouped the Angles with several other tribes in that region, the <a href="Reudigni">Reudigni</a>, <a href="Aviones">Aviones</a>, <a href="Varini">Varini</a>, <a href="Eudoses">Eudoses</a>, <a href="Suarini">Suarini</a> and <a href="Nuitones">Nuitones</a>. These were all living behind ramparts of rivers and woods and therefore inaccessible to attack.

He gives no precise indication of their geographical situation but states that, together with the six other tribes, they worshiped <a href="Nerthus">Nerthus</a>, or Mother Earth, whose sanctuary was located on "an island in the Ocean". The Eudoses are the <a href="Jutes">Jutes</a>, these names probably refer to localities in <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> or on the Baltic coast. The coast contains sufficient estuaries, inlets, rivers, islands, swamps and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain, such as the Romans, who considered it unknown, inaccessible, with a small population and of little economic interest.

The majority of scholars believe that the Anglii lived on the coasts of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, probably in the southern part of the Jutish peninsula. This view is based partly on Old English and Danish traditions regarding persons and events of the 4th century, and partly on the fact that striking affinities to the cult of <a href="Nerthus">Nerthus</a> as described by Tacitus are to be found in pre-Christian <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n, especially Swedish and Danish, religion.

<a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> writing in around AD150, in his atlas "<a href="Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29">Geography</a>" (2.10), describes the "Sueboi Angeilloi", Latinised to "Suevi Angili", further south, living in a stretch of land between the northern Rhine and central Elbe, but apparently not touching either river, with the Suebic <a href="Langobardi">Langobardi</a> on the Rhine to their west, and the Suebic <a href="Semnones">Semnones</a> on the Elbe stretching to their east.

These Suevi Angili would have been in <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a> or near it, but they are not coastal. The three Suebic peoples are separated from the coastal <a href="Chauci">Chauci</a>, (between <a href="Ems%20%28river%29">Ems</a> and <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>), and <a href="Saxones">Saxones</a>, (east of the Elbe mouth), by a series of tribes including, between <a href="Weser">Weser</a> and Elbe, the <a href="Angrivarii">Angrivarii</a>, "Laccobardi" (probably another reference to Langobardi, but taken by Ptolemy from another source), and <a href="Dulgubnii">Dulgubnii</a>. South of the Saxons, and east of the Elbe, Ptolemy lists "Ouirounoi" (Latinised as Viruni, and probably the Varini) and Teutonoari, which either denotes "the Teuton men", or else it denotes people living in the area where the Teutons had previously lived (who Ptolemy places still living to the east of the Teutonoari). Ptolemy describes the coast to the east of the Saxons as inhabited by the <a href="Farodini">Farodini</a>, a name not known from any other sources.

Owing to the uncertainty of this passage, there has been much speculation regarding the original home of the Anglii. One theory is that they or part of them dwelt or moved among other coastal people perhaps confederated up to the basin of the <a href="Saale">Saale</a> (in the neighbourhood of the ancient canton of <a href="Unstruttal%20%28Verwaltungsgemeinschaft%29">Engilin</a>) on the <a href="Unstrut">Unstrut</a> valleys below the <a href="Kyffh%C3%A4userkreis">Kyffhäuserkreis</a>, from which region the "Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum" is believed by many to have come. The ethnic names of <a href="Frisii">Frisians</a> and <a href="Warini">Warines</a> are also attested in these <a href="Saxon">Saxon</a> districts.

A second possible solution is that these Angles of Ptolemy are not those of Schleswig at all. According to <a href="Julius%20Pokorny">Julius Pokorny</a> the Angri- in <a href="Angrivarii">Angrivarii</a>, the -angr in <a href="Hardanger">Hardanger</a> and the Angl- in Anglii all come from the same root meaning "bend", but in different senses. In other words, the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond Germanic.

On the other hand, Gudmund Schütte, in his analysis of Ptolemy, believes that the Angles have simply been moved by an error coming from Ptolemy's use of imperfect sources. He points out that Angles are placed correctly just to the northeast of the <a href="Langobardi">Langobardi</a>, but that these have been duplicated, so that they appear once, correctly, on the lower Elbe, and a second time, incorrectly, at the northern Rhine.

<a href="Bede">Bede</a> states that the Anglii, before coming to Great Britain, dwelt in a land called Angulus, "which lies between the province of the Jutes and the Saxons, and remains unpopulated to this day." Similar evidence is given by the "<a href="Historia%20Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a>". King <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> and the chronicler <a href="%C3%86thelweard%20%28historian%29">Æthelweard</a> identified this place with the district that is now called <a href="Angeln">Angeln</a>, in the province of <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> (Slesvig) (though it may then have been of greater extent), and this identification agrees with the indications given by Bede.

In the Norwegian seafarer <a href="Ohthere%20of%20H%C3%A5logaland">Ohthere of Hålogaland</a>'s account of a two-day voyage from the Oslo fjord to Schleswig, he reported the lands on his starboard bow, and Alfred appended the note "on these islands dwelt the "Engle" before they came hither". Confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions relating to two kings named <a href="Wermund">Wermund</a> and <a href="Offa%20of%20Angel">Offa of Angel</a>, from whom the <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>n royal family claimed descent and whose exploits are connected with Angeln, Schleswig, and <a href="Rendsburg">Rendsburg</a>. Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in their service, <a href="Frowinus">Frowinus</a> (<a href="Freawine">Freawine</a>) and <a href="Ket%20and%20Wig">Wigo</a> (Wig), from whom the royal family of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> claimed descent. During the 5th century, the Anglii invaded Great Britain, after which time their name does not recur on the continent except in the title of the legal code issued to the <a href="Thuringii">Thuringians</a>: "Lex Anglorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum".

The Angles are the subject of a legend about <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory I</a>, who happened to see a group of Angle children from <a href="Deira%20%28kingdom%29">Deira</a> for sale as slaves in the Roman market. As the story would later be told by the Anglo-Saxon monk and historian <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, Gregory was struck by the unusual appearance of the slaves and asked about their background. When told they were called ""Anglii"" (Angles), he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English: “"Bene, nam et angelicam habent faciem, et tales angelorum in caelis decet esse coheredes"” ("It is well, for they have an angelic face, and such people ought to be co-heirs of the <a href="angel">angel</a>s in heaven"). Supposedly, this encounter inspired the Pope to launch a mission to bring Christianity to their countrymen.

The province of Schleswig has proved rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries. A large cremation cemetery has been found at <a href="Borgstedt">Borgstedt</a>, between Rendsburg and <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde">Eckernförde</a>, and it has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in pagan graves in England. Of still greater importance are the great deposits at <a href="Thorsberg%20moor">Thorsberg moor</a> (in Angeln) and <a href="Nydam%20Mose">Nydam</a>, which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments, articles of clothing, agricultural implements, etc., and in Nydam even ships. By the help of these discoveries, Angle culture in the age preceding the invasion of Britannia can be pieced together.

According to sources such as the "History" of Bede, after the invasion of Britannia, the Angles split up and founded the kingdoms of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, and <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>. H.R. Loyn has observed in this context that "a sea voyage is perilous to tribal institutions", and the apparently tribe-based kingdoms were formed in England. In early times there were two northern kingdoms (Bernicia and Deira) and two midland ones (Middle Anglia and Mercia), which had by the 7th century resolved themselves into two Angle kingdoms, viz., Northumbria and Mercia. Northumbria held suzerainty amidst the <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Teutonic</a> presence in the British Isles in the 7th century, but was eclipsed by the rise of Mercia in the 8th century. Both kingdoms fell in the great assaults of the Danish <a href="Viking">Viking</a> armies in the 9th century. Their royal houses were effectively destroyed in the fighting, and their Angle populations came under the <a href="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>. Further south, the Saxon kings of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> withstood the Danish assaults. Then in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, the kings of Wessex defeated the Danes and liberated the Angles from the Danelaw. They united their house in marriage with the surviving Angle royalty, and were accepted by the Angles as their kings. This marked the passing of the old '<a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a>' world and the dawn of the "<a href="English%20people">English</a>" as a new people. The regions of East Anglia and Northumbria are still known by their original titles. Northumbria once stretched as far north as what is now southeast <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, including <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, and as far south as the <a href="Humber%20Estuary">Humber Estuary</a>.

The rest of that people stayed at the centre of the Angle homeland in the northeastern portion of the modern German "Bundesland" of <a href="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>, on the <a href="Jutland%20Peninsula">Jutland Peninsula</a>. There, a small peninsular area is still called "<a href="Angeln">Angeln</a>" today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a> on the Flensburger Fjord to the <a href="City%20of%20Schleswig">City of Schleswig</a> and then to Maasholm, on the <a href="Schlei">Schlei</a> inlet.

Aster CT-80

The Aster CT-80, an early (1982) <a href="home%20computer">home</a>/<a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> developed by the small <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> company MCP (later renamed to Aster Computers), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists. Later it was sold ready to use. It consisted of several <a href="Eurocard%20%28printed%20circuit%20board%29">Eurocard</a> <a href="Printed%20circuit%20board">PCB's</a> with <a href="DIN%2041612">DIN 41612</a> connectors, and a <a href="backplane">backplane</a> all based on a <a href="19-inch%20rack">19-inch rack</a> configuration. It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer. The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> software, with a big amount of free memory <a href="CP/M%23Transient_Program_Area">Transient Program Area</a>, (TPA) and a full 80×25 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal. Although the Aster was a clone of the TRS-80 Model I it was in fact more compatible with the <a href="TRS-80%20Model%20III">TRS-80 Model III</a>, and ran all the software of these systems including games. It also had a built in speaker which was compatible with such games software.

Three models were sold. The first model (launched June 1982) looked like the later <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> (which came on the market years later), a rectangular base unit with two <a href="floppy">floppy</a> drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard. The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5¼" floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened <a href="Apple%20II">Apple</a> with a built-in keyboard.

All units ran much faster than the original <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a>, at 4 <a href="Megahertz">MHz</a>, (with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic), and an improved character font set. The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 <a href="Kilobyte">KB</a>, more than four times the capacity of the original TRS-80. A special version of <a href="NewDos/80">NewDos/80</a>, (an improved <a href="TRS-DOS">TRS-DOS</a> compatible <a href="Disk%20operating%20system">Disk operating system</a>) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.

For the educational market a version of the first model was produced with a new plastic enclosure (the First Asters had an all-metal enclosure) that also had an opening on the top in which a cassette recorder could be placed. This model was used in a cluster with one Aster (with disk drives) for the teacher, and eight disk less versions for the pupils. The pupils could download software from the teachers computer through a network based on a fast serial connection, as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer. There was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor.

The Aster used 64KB of <a href="Random%20Access%20Memory">RAM</a> memory and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy or with a TRS-DOS floppy, the Aster would be fully <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> compatible, with 48KB or RAM. When the boot loader detected a <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> floppy, the Aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free RAM for programs (<a href="CP/M%23Transient_Program_Area">TPA</a>) and an 80 x 25 display. This dual-architecture capability only existed on one other TRS-80 clone, the <a href="Max-80">LOBO Max-80</a>.

With a special configuration tool, the CT-80 could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.

A third mode was entered with a special boot floppy which turned the Aster into a <a href="Videotex">Videotex</a> terminal with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in RS232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.

Most Aster CT-80's (about 10 thousand of them) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the "honderd scholen project" (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools. MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands. Another important demand was that the computers could be used in a network (Aster developed special software and hardware for that). Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to <a href="Philips">Philips</a> and their <a href="Philips%20P2000">P2000</a> homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the technical demands, was made in <a href="Austria">Austria</a> and did not have network hard nor software.

Aster computers was based in the small town of <a href="Arkel">Arkel</a> near the town of <a href="Gorinchem">Gorinchem</a>.
Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music. The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time . They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the "<a href="Elektor%20Junior%20Computer">junior Computer</a>" from <a href="Elektor">Elektor</a> (a copy of the <a href="KIM-1">KIM-1</a>), and the <a href="ZX80">ZX80</a> from Sinclair. Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers. But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the <a href="Western%20Digital%23Key%20innovations">WD1771</a> floppy disc controller chip without an external "data separator". To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation. Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable. So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure. The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64 KB RAM chips.
While this went on MCP renamed itself to "MCP CHIP" but ran into problems with the German computer magazine "<a href="CHIP%20%28magazine%29">CHIP</a>", and had to return to its former name. At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a>, the <a href="Video%20Genie">Video Genie</a>, (another TRS-80 clone), the <a href="Luxor%20AB">Luxor</a> <a href="ABC%2080">ABC 80</a> and the <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>.
They also sold the exotic <a href="Olivetti">Olivetti</a> M20, a very early 16-bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a <a href="Z8000">Z8000</a> CPU.

After designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface. They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas. The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low. Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80. So they decided to design a TRS-80 and CP/M software-compatible computer system, which (following the lead of <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple Computer</a>) they decided to name after a "typical Dutch flower". So they called it the Aster CT-80 (CP/M/Tandy-1980). Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that "Aster" is also a Dutch girls' name has something to do with it. Remarkably "Aster" was also the name given to a Dutch <a href="Supercomputer">Supercomputer</a> much later, in 2002.

The first version of the Aster consisted of four "<a href="Eurocard%20%28PCB%29">Eurocard</a>'s", one <a href="Z80">Z80</a> CPU card with 64 KB memory, one <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> <a href="MC6845">MC6845</a>-based video card, one <a href="double%20density">double density</a> floppy disk controller card and one "keyboard/<a href="RS232">RS232</a>/cassette interface" card. Plus a "backplane card", (which connected all the other cards) and a keyboard. And was intended for hobbyists, to be sold as a kit consisting of the parts and the PCB's for the computer and attached keyboard. After selling a few kits, MCP became convinced there was a much bigger market for an improved model sold as a completed working system. However the original kit version lacked many features that prevented its use as a serious computer system. Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, (adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80/64 column text mode support, (with different size letters for TRS-80 and CP/M mode, so that in TRS-80 mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64×16 portion of the 80×25 screen) with an improved font set (adding "gray scale" version of the TRS-80 mozaik graphics and many special <a href="PETSCII">PETSCII</a> like characters), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, (in the form of a <a href="19-inch%20rack">19-inch rack</a> for the Eurocards) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply. A software engineer was hired to write the special "dual boot mode" BIOS and the special CP/M BIOS. The "dual boot mode" BIOS actually discovered whether a TRS-DOS, or Aster CP/M disk was placed in the drive, and would, depending on the type of disk, reorganise the internal memory architecture of the system, to either be 100% TRS-80 compatible or optimally support CP/M, with as much "workspace" as possible, and the 80×25 video mode. It also was responsible for switching to ROM BASIC when the system was turned on with the break key pressed, and later supported a primitive LAN system, using the RS232 port with modified cabling. The very first of the ready made computers were sold with the "kit" versions of the euro cards, the version with redesigned cards came a month or so later.

Soon the little shop became much too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby (formerly a window glass factory), and started mass-producing the Aster for a period of a few years, in which time its staff grew twentyfold.

After the Aster having been a few years on the Market Tandy released its own improved model, the <a href="TRS-80%20Model%20III">TRS-80 Model III</a> computer which solved many of the same problems that the Aster also had solved, but the model 3 still did not fully support CP/M as the Aster did. In the meantime IBM had released its original IBM PC, which incidentally looked remarkably like the Asters base with floppy drives + separate keyboard set-up.

The Aster was chosen for Dutch schools by the Dutch ministry of education, in a set-up with eight disk-less Asters, and one Aster with high-capacity floppy drives all connected by a LAN based on the Aster's high-speed serial port hardware, and special cables that permitted that any single computer on the LAN could broadcast to all other computers. The floppy based system was operated by the teacher who could send programs from his floppy disk, and data, to the student's disk-less systems thanks to the special BIOS in those systems. The students could send programs and data back to the teacher through the same LAN, or could save to a cassette recorder built into the disk-less units. Through a special "video-switch" the teacher was also able to see a copy of each student's display on his own screen. About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.

Because of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.

Perhaps the Aster computer inspired another <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower—the <a href="Tulip%20Computers">Tulip's</a> <a href="Tulip%20System-1">Tulip System-1</a> which appeared about the same time Aster folded.

Most of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) <a href="MSX">MSX</a> system for a company called "Micro Technology b.v.".

To enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system).

A hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> interface, and the necessary software. A working prototype was developed that added a 40MB hard disk.

On the software front, work was being done to implement the replacement for the aging "user interface" of CP/M, (the Command Console Processor <a href="CP/M%23Console%20Command%20Processor">CCP</a> ) with the more modern <a href="ZCPR">ZCPR</a>.

Finally a replacement for the aging <a href="Z80">Z80</a> processor was being developed in the form of an <a href="Intel%208086">Intel 8086</a> board, and additional 512K 16 bit memory boards. Such replacements of CPU and memory system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that was designed to support both 8 and 16 bit processors, and used a modular Eurocard based design with slots to spare for expansion. In theory the system could support the Z80 and the 8086 simultaneously. Plans were formulated to support CP/M-86 and even MS-DOS.

Unfortunately none of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before any of them could be released.

Atlanta Braves

The Atlanta Braves are an American <a href="professional%20baseball">professional baseball</a> franchise based in the <a href="Atlanta%20metropolitan%20area">Atlanta metropolitan area</a>. The franchise competes in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) as a member of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) <a href="National%20League%20East">East</a> division. The Braves played home games at <a href="Atlanta%E2%80%93Fulton%20County%20Stadium">Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium</a> from 1966 to 1996, and <a href="Turner%20Field">Turner Field</a> from 1997 to 2016. Since 2017, their home stadium has been <a href="SunTrust%20Park">SunTrust Park</a>, a new stadium 10 miles (16 km) northwest of <a href="downtown%20Atlanta">downtown Atlanta</a> in the <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Georgia">Cumberland</a> neighborhood of <a href="Cobb%20County">Cobb County</a>. The Braves play <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> games in <a href="Lake%20Buena%20Vista%2C%20Florida">Lake Buena Vista, Florida</a>. In January 2017, the Braves announced a formal agreement to move their <a href="New%20Braves%20Spring%20Training%20Stadium">spring training home</a> to <a href="North%20Port%2C%20Florida">North Port, Florida</a>. 

The "Braves" name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for a Native American warrior. They are <a href="List%20of%20baseball%20nicknames">nicknamed</a> "the "Bravos"", and often referred to as "<a href="America%27s%20Team%23Other%20uses">America's Team</a>" in reference to the team's games being broadcast on the nationally available <a href="Braves%20TBS%20Baseball">TBS</a> from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a nationwide fan base.

From 1991 to 2005, the Braves were one of the most successful teams in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times (omitting the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">strike-shortened</a> 1994 season in which there were no official division champions), and producing the greatest pitching rotation in the history of baseball. The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and they returned to the playoffs as the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20wild%20card">National League Wild Card</a> in 2010. The Braves advanced to the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995. Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 17 divisional titles, 17 <a href="National%20League%20Championship%20Series">National League</a> <a href="Pennant%20%28sports%29">pennants</a>, and three World Series championships—in <a href="1914%20World%20Series">1914</a> as the Boston Braves, in <a href="1957%20World%20Series">1957</a> as the Milwaukee Braves, and in <a href="1995%20World%20Series">1995</a> in Atlanta. The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities.

The Braves and the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> are the National League's two remaining charter franchises. The Braves were founded in <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, in 1871, as the Boston Red Stockings (not to be confused with the American League's <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>). The team states it is "the oldest continuously operating <a href="Major%20professional%20sports%20teams%20of%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada">professional sports franchise in America</a>."

After various name changes, the team eventually began operating as the Boston Braves, which lasted for most of the first half of the 20th century. Then, in 1953, the team <a href="relocation%20of%20professional%20sports%20teams">moved</a> to <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, and became the Milwaukee Braves, followed by the final move to Atlanta in 1966. The team's tenure in Atlanta is noted for <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a> breaking <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>'s career home run record in 1974.

The <a href="Cincinnati%20Red%20Stockings">Cincinnati Red Stockings</a>, established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season. Player-manager <a href="Harry%20Wright">Harry Wright</a>, with brother <a href="George%20Wright%20%28sportsman%29">George</a> and two other Cincinnati players, then went to Boston, Massachusetts at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder <a href="Ivers%20Whitney%20Adams">Ivers Whitney Adams</a> to form the nucleus of the "Boston Red Stockings", a charter member of the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</a> (NAPBBP). The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports. (The only other team that has been organized as long, the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, did not play for the two years following the <a href="Great%20Chicago%20Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871.) Two young players hired away from the <a href="Rockford%20Forest%20Citys">Forest City club</a> of <a href="Rockford%2C%20Illinois">Rockford, Illinois</a>, turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher <a href="Albert%20Spalding">Al Spalding</a> (founder of <a href="Spalding%20%28sports%20equipment%29">Spalding</a> sporting goods) and second baseman <a href="Ross%20Barnes">Ross Barnes</a>.

Led by the Wright brothers, Barnes, and Spalding, the Red Stockings dominated the National Association, winning four of that league's five championships. The team became one of the National League's charter franchises in 1876, sometimes called the ""Red Caps"" (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member). 

The Boston Red Caps played in the first game in the history of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%23Founding">the National League</a>, on Saturday, April 22, <a href="1876%20in%20baseball">1876</a>, defeating the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics%20%281860%E2%80%9376%29">Athletics</a>, 6–5.
Although somewhat stripped of talent in the National League's inaugural year, Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants. The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants. For most of that time, their <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> was <a href="Frank%20Selee">Frank Selee</a>. Boston came to be called the "Beaneaters" in 1883, while retaining red as the team color. The <a href="1898%20Boston%20Beaneaters%20season">1898 team</a> finished 102–47, a club record for wins that would stand for <a href="1993%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">almost a century</a>. Stars of those 1890s Beaneater teams included the "Heavenly Twins", <a href="Hugh%20Duffy">Hugh Duffy</a> and <a href="Tommy%20McCarthy">Tommy McCarthy</a>, as well as "Slidin'" <a href="Billy%20Hamilton%20%28baseball%2C%20born%201866%29">Billy Hamilton</a>.
The team was decimated when the <a href="American%20League">American League</a>'s new Boston entry set up shop in 1901. Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match. They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913, and lost 100 games five times. In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in "The Sporting News Baseball Guide" during the 1940s when each team's entry had a <a href="History%20of%20baseball%20team%20nicknames">history of its nickname(s)</a>. The American League club's owner, Charles Taylor, wasted little time in adopting <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Red Sox</a> as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic "Americans"). Media-driven nickname changes to the "Doves" in 1907 and the "Rustlers" in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck. The team became the "Braves" for the first time in 1912. Their owner, <a href="James%20E.%20Gaffney">James Gaffney</a>, was a member of New York City's political machine, <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a>, which used an Indian chief as their symbol.

Two years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. After a dismal 4–18 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last place finish. On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the <a href="1914%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>. The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place, "15 games" behind the league-leading <a href="1914%20New%20York%20Giants%20season">New York Giants</a>, who had won the previous three league pennants. After a day off, the Braves started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41–12. On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three games from the New York Giants and moved into first place. The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16–16. They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.
Despite their amazing comeback, the Braves entered the <a href="1914%20World%20Series">World Series</a> as a heavy underdog to <a href="Connie%20Mack">Connie Mack</a>'s <a href="1914%20Philadelphia%20Athletics%20season">Philadelphia A's</a>. Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics—the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> (the <a href="1907%20World%20Series">1907 Series</a> had one tied game) to win the world championship. Meanwhile, <a href="Johnny%20Evers">Johnny Evers</a> won the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Chalmers Award</a>.

The Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>, since their normal home, the <a href="South%20End%20Grounds">South End Grounds</a>, was too small. However, the Braves' success inspired owner Gaffney to build a modern park, <a href="Braves%20Field">Braves Field</a>, which opened in August 1915. It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield. The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.

After contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. The lone highlight of those years came when Judge <a href="Emil%20Fuchs%20%28baseball%29">Emil Fuchs</a> bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great <a href="Christy%20Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a>, back into the game. However, Mathewson died in 1925, leaving Fuchs in control of the team.

Fuchs was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome. The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager <a href="Bill%20McKechnie">Bill McKechnie</a>, but Fuchs' revenue was severely depleted due to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>.

Looking for a way to get more fans and more money, Fuchs worked out a deal with the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> to acquire <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, who had started his career with the Red Sox. Fuchs made Ruth team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits. He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals. Fuchs even suggested that Ruth, who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once McKechnie stepped down—perhaps as early as 1936.

At first, it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 win over the <a href="1936%20New%20York%20Giants%20%28MLB%29%20season">Giants</a>. However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of "his" money in the team.

Seeing a franchise in complete disarray, Ruth retired on June 1—only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s of his career. He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but Fuchs wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park. The Braves finished 38–115, the worst season in franchise history. Their .248 winning percentage is <a href="List%20of%20worst%20MLB%20season%20records">the third-worst in baseball history</a>, and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the <a href="1899%20Cleveland%20Spiders%20season">1899 Cleveland Spiders</a>).

Fuchs lost control of the team in August 1935, and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the "Boston Bees". This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate <a href="Lou%20Perini">Lou Perini</a>, changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of <a href="Warren%20Spahn">Warren Spahn</a> to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.
In 1948, the <a href="1948%20Boston%20Braves%20season">team</a> won the pennant, behind the pitching of Spahn and <a href="Johnny%20Sain">Johnny Sain</a>, who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, "Boston Post" writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:

The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as ""Spahn and Sain and pray for rain"", entered the baseball vocabulary. However, in the 1948 season, the Braves actually had the same record in games that Spahn and Sain started that the team had overall, in terms of winning percentage.

The <a href="1948%20World%20Series">1948 World Series</a>, which the Braves lost in six games to the <a href="1948%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Indians</a>, turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston. In 1950, <a href="Sam%20Jethroe">Sam Jethroe</a> became the team's first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18. Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953, Perini, who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, where the Braves had their top farm club, the <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers%20minor%20league">Brewers</a>. Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation. <a href="Bill%20Veeck">Bill Veeck</a> had tried to return his <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a> there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.

Milwaukee went wild over the Braves, who were welcomed as genuine heroes. The Braves finished 92–62 in their first season in Milwaukee, and drew a then-NL record 1.8 million fans. The success of the team was noted by many owners. Not coincidentally, the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>, <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>, <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>, and <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> would leave their original hometowns within the next five years.
As the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers <a href="Eddie%20Mathews">Eddie Mathews</a> and <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a> drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee), often aided by another power hitter, <a href="Joe%20Adcock">Joe Adcock</a>, while <a href="Warren%20Spahn">Warren Spahn</a>, <a href="Lew%20Burdette">Lew Burdette</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Buhl">Bob Buhl</a> anchored the rotation. The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.

In <a href="1957%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season">1957</a>, the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's <a href="MLB%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">MVP season</a>, as he led the National League in home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run <a href="walk-off%20home%20run">walk-off home run</a> that gave the Braves a 4–2 victory over the <a href="1957%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a> and clinched the League championship. The team then went on to its first <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> win in over 40 years, defeating the powerful <a href="1957%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York Yankees</a> of <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Berra</a>, <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mantle</a>, and <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Ford</a> in seven games. One-time Yankee Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three complete game victories against his former team, giving up only two earned runs.

In <a href="1958%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season">1958</a>, the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the <a href="1958%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York Yankees</a> once more, thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP <a href="Bob%20Turley">Bob Turley</a>'s pitching.

The <a href="1959%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season">1959 season</a> saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the <a href="1959%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, both with 86–68 records. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the <a href="1959%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">Chicago White Sox</a> in the <a href="1959%20World%20Series">World Series</a>.
The next six years were up-and-down for the Braves. The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the <a href="1960%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, who ultimately were to win the <a href="1960%20World%20Series">World Series</a> that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher <a href="Harvey%20Haddix">Harvey Haddix</a>. The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.

Aaron hit 45 <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth. <a href="1963%20in%20baseball">The next season</a>, Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23–7. However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the lower half of the league, or "<a href="first%20division%20%28baseball%29">second division</a>", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.

The Braves were somewhat mediocre as the 1960s began, but fattened up on the expansion <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> and <a href="Houston%20Colt%20.45s">Houston Colt .45s</a>. To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team who played more than one season and never had a losing record.

Perini sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by <a href="William%20Bartholomay">William Bartholomay</a> in 1962. Almost immediately Bartholomay started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor
<a href="Ivan%20Allen%2C%20Jr.">Ivan Allen, Jr.</a> constructed a new $18 million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, <a href="Atlanta%20Stadium">Atlanta Stadium</a>, which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Athletics">Kansas City A's</a> to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.

<a href="Eddie%20Mathews">Eddie Mathews</a> is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in. Mathews played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.

The Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85–77 in 1966, 77–85 in 1967, and 81–81 in 1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston. In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever <a href="National%20League%20West">National League West</a> Division title, before being swept by the "<a href="1969%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">Miracle Mets</a>" in the <a href="1969%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">National League Championship Series</a>. They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 – in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.
In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium ("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in <a href="Rico%20Carty">Rico Carty</a> (in 1970) and <a href="Ralph%20Garr">Ralph Garr</a> (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 – <a href="Darrell%20Evans">Darrell Evans</a>, <a href="Davey%20Johnson">Davey Johnson</a> and, of course, Aaron.

By the end of the 1973 season, Aaron had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. The <a href="1974%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">next season</a>, it was only a matter of time before he set a new record. On April 4, opening day, he hit No.714 in <a href="1974%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati</a>, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander <a href="Al%20Downing%20%28baseball%29">Al Downing</a> of the <a href="1974%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before asking to be traded to the <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a>, while Ruth finished his career as a Boston Brave. In fact, until <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a> eclipsed the 714 home runs hit by <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> in 2006, the top two home run hitters in Major League history had at one time been Braves.

In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate <a href="Ted%20Turner">Ted Turner</a>, owner of <a href="superstation">superstation</a> <a href="TBS%20%28TV%20network%29">WTBS</a>, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed <a href="Atlanta%E2%80%93Fulton%20County%20Stadium">Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium</a>. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a>, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the <a href="1977%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Braves</a> lost 2–1 to the <a href="1977%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> to bring their losing streak to 17 games).

Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as "The Atlanta Braves: <a href="America%27s%20Team">America's Team</a>", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially <a href="Southern%20United%20States">the South</a>. Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname "Channel" for pitcher <a href="Andy%20Messersmith">Andy Messersmith</a> and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired <a href="Braves%20TBS%20Baseball">Braves games</a>. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.

After three straight losing seasons, <a href="Bobby%20Cox">Bobby Cox</a> was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season. He promoted 22-year-old slugger <a href="Dale%20Murphy">Dale Murphy</a> into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In 1980, Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with <a href="Joe%20Torre">Joe Torre</a>, under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from <a href="Bob%20Horner">Bob Horner</a>, <a href="Chris%20Chambliss">Chris Chambliss</a>, pitcher <a href="Phil%20Niekro">Phil Niekro</a>, and short relief pitcher <a href="Gene%20Garber">Gene Garber</a> helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a <a href="MLB%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20award">Most Valuable Player</a> and a <a href="Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Glove award</a>. Murphy also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox as <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a>. Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Indian-themed mascot, <a href="Chief%20Noc-A-Homa">Chief Noc-A-Homa</a>.

Cox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing <a href="Russ%20Nixon">Russ Nixon</a>. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97. They traded Dale Murphy to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach <a href="Leo%20Mazzone">Leo Mazzone</a> began developing young pitchers <a href="Tom%20Glavine">Tom Glavine</a>, <a href="Steve%20Avery">Steve Avery</a>, and <a href="John%20Smoltz">John Smoltz</a> into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the <a href="1990%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1990 MLB draft</a> to select <a href="Chipper%20Jones">Chipper Jones</a>, who became one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, <a href="John%20Schuerholz">John Schuerholz</a> was hired away from the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> as general manager.

The following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile, behind position players <a href="David%20Justice">David Justice</a>, <a href="Ron%20Gant">Ron Gant</a> and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion <a href="Terry%20Pendleton">Terry Pendleton</a>, the <a href="1991%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Braves</a> overcame a 39–40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the <a href="1991%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races. The "Worst to First" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the <a href="1991%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in a very tightly contested seven-game <a href="1991%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NLCS</a> only to lose the <a href="1991%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, also in seven games, to the <a href="1991%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Minnesota Twins</a>. The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.

Despite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue. In 1992, the <a href="1992%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Braves</a> returned to the <a href="1992%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NLCS</a> and once again defeated the <a href="1992%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">Pirates</a> in seven games, culminating in a <a href="Francisco%20Cabrera%20game">dramatic game seven win</a>. <a href="Francisco%20Cabrera%20%28baseball%29">Francisco Cabrera</a>'s two-out single that scored <a href="David%20Justice">David Justice</a> and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3–2 victory. It was the first time in post season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The Braves lost the <a href="1992%20World%20Series">World Series</a> to the <a href="1992%20Toronto%20Blue%20Jays%20season">Toronto Blue Jays</a>, however. In 1993, the Braves signed <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> winning pitcher <a href="Greg%20Maddux">Greg Maddux</a> from the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball. The <a href="1993%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">1993 team</a> posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the <a href="1993%20San%20Francisco%20Giants%20season">San Francisco Giants</a>, who won 103 games. The Braves needed a stunning 55–19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However, the Braves fell in the <a href="1993%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NLCS</a> to the <a href="1993%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">Philadelphia Phillies</a> in six games.

In 1994, in a realignment of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>'s divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division. This realignment was the main cause of the team's <a href="Braves%E2%80%93Mets%20rivalry">heated rivalry</a> with the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> during the mid-to-late 1990s.

The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">player's strike</a> cut short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the <a href="1994%20Montreal%20Expos%20season">Montreal Expos</a> with 48 games left to play.

The Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the <a href="1995%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland Indians</a> in the <a href="1995%20World%20Series">1995 World Series</a>. This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the "<a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> of Baseball" (January 1996 issue of "Beckett <a href="Baseball%20Card">Baseball Card</a> Monthly"). With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities. With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the and <a href="1999%20World%20Series">1999 World Series</a> (losing both to the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, managed by <a href="Joe%20Torre">Joe Torre</a>, a former Braves manager), and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early. Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization —Cox was the Braves' manager, while Schuerholz remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president. Terry Pendleton finished his playing career elsewhere, but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.

In October 1996, Time Warner acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves. Over the next few years, Ted Turner's presence as owner of the team would diminish.
A 95–67 record in produced a ninth consecutive division title. However, a sweep by the <a href="2000%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the <a href="2000%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">National League Division Series</a> prevented the Braves from reaching the <a href="2000%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NL Championship Series</a>.

In 2001, Atlanta won the National League East division yet again, swept the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> in the NLDS, then lost to the <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> in the <a href="2001%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">National League Championship Series</a> four games to one. One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played <a href="Braves%E2%80%93Mets%20rivalry">rival</a> <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since <a href="September%2011%20attacks">9/11</a>.

In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the <a href="2002%20San%20Francisco%20Giants%20season">San Francisco Giants</a>, <a href="2005%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">Chicago Cubs</a>, and <a href="2006%20Houston%20Astros%20season">Houston Astros</a>.

Six National League <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>s in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers:

In 2005, the Braves won the Division championship for the 14th consecutive time from 1991 to 2005. 14 consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball. The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs (<a href="Wilson%20Betemit">Wilson Betemit</a>, <a href="Brian%20McCann%20%28baseball%29">Brian McCann</a>, <a href="Pete%20Orr">Pete Orr</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Langerhans">Ryan Langerhans</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Francoeur">Jeff Francoeur</a>). Catcher Brian McCann, right fielder Jeff Francoeur, and pitcher <a href="Kyle%20Davies%20%28baseball%29">Kyle Davies</a> all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the "Baby Braves" by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to a record of 90–72.

However, the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the <a href="2005%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">National League Division Series</a> to the <a href="2005%20Houston%20Astros%20season">Astros</a> in four games. In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros battled back with a <a href="Lance%20Berkman">Lance Berkman</a> <a href="grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29">grand slam</a> and a two-out, ninth inning <a href="Brad%20Ausmus">Brad Ausmus</a> home run off of Braves closer <a href="Kyle%20Farnsworth">Kyle Farnsworth</a>. The game did not end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50 minutes. <a href="Chris%20Burke%20%28baseball%29">Chris Burke</a> ended the marathon with a home run off of <a href="Joey%20Devine">Joey Devine</a>.

After the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach <a href="Leo%20Mazzone">Leo Mazzone</a>, who left to go to the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. <a href="Roger%20McDowell">Roger McDowell</a> took his place in the Atlanta dugout. Unable to re-sign shortstop <a href="Rafael%20Furcal">Rafael Furcal</a>, the Braves acquired shortstop <a href="%C3%89dgar%20Renter%C3%ADa">Édgar Rentería</a> from the Boston Red Sox.

In 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to. Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6–21 record during June, the worst month ever in Atlanta with a winning percentage of .222; this was only better than the woeful <a href="1935%20Boston%20Braves%20season">Boston Braves</a> in May 1935 (4–20) with a .166 winning percentage.

After the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records. They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span. The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the <a href="1897%20Boston%20Beaneaters%20season">Boston Beaneaters</a> totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 – June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the <a href="1930%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1930 New York Yankees</a> to score ten runs or more in five straight games. The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8–3 victory over <a href="2006%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati</a> on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break. Additionally, Chipper Jones was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie <a href="Paul%20Waner">Paul Waner</a>'s 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.

However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the <a href="2006%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">Florida Marlins</a> mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves' 11-year reign over the NL East. On September 24, the Braves' loss to the <a href="2006%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season">Colorado Rockies</a> mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season. Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie <a href="Chuck%20James">Chuck James</a> besting <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a>, Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79–83.

In December 2005, team owner <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a>, who inherited the Braves after purchasing <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">TBS</a> in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale. <a href="Liberty%20Media">Liberty Media</a> began negotiations to purchase the team.

In February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal that would sell the Braves to <a href="Liberty%20Media">Liberty Media Group</a> (a company which owned a large amount of stock in <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner, Inc.</a>), pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball, <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a>. The deal included the exchange of the Braves, valued in the deal at $450 million, a hobbyist magazine publishing company, and $980 million cash, for 68.5 million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty Media, then worth approximately $1.48 billion. Team President Terry McGuirk anticipated no change in the current front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day operations of the Braves. Liberty Media is not expected to take any type of "active" ownership in terms of day-to-day operations.

On May 16, 2007, Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale of the Braves from Time Warner to Liberty Media. The Braves are one of only two Major League Baseball teams under majority corporate ownership (and the only NL team with this distinction); the other team is the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> (owned by Canadian media conglomerate <a href="Rogers%20Communications">Rogers Communications</a>).

On July 5, <a href="Chipper%20Jones">Chipper Jones</a> surpassed Dale Murphy for the Atlanta club record of 372 home runs by belting two against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>.

After struggling during the second half of the 2007 season, Atlanta finished over .500 and missed the post season again. On October 12, 2007, <a href="John%20Schuerholz">John Schuerholz</a> stepped down as General Manager to take over as team president. Assistant GM <a href="Frank%20Wren">Frank Wren</a> took over as General Manager.

On December 4, 2008, the Atlanta Braves received <a href="Javier%20V%C3%A1zquez">Javier Vázquez</a> and <a href="Boone%20Logan">Boone Logan</a>, while the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> received prospects catcher <a href="Tyler%20Flowers">Tyler Flowers</a>, shortstop <a href="Brent%20Lillibridge">Brent Lillibridge</a>, third baseman <a href="Jon%20Gilmore">Jon Gilmore</a> and pitcher <a href="Santos%20Rodriguez">Santos Rodriguez</a>. On January 13, 2009, the Braves signed Japanese pitcher <a href="Kenshin%20Kawakami">Kenshin Kawakami</a> to a three-year deal, and two days later signed free agent pitcher <a href="Derek%20Lowe">Derek Lowe</a> to a four-year contract. During the course of the offseason, the Braves signed veteran pitcher and former Brave <a href="Tom%20Glavine">Tom Glavine</a>, while losing long-time Brave <a href="John%20Smoltz">John Smoltz</a> to the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>.

On February 25, 2009, just before the start of spring training, Atlanta agreed to terms on a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder <a href="Garret%20Anderson">Garret Anderson</a>. The additional outfield depth allowed the Braves to trade <a href="Josh%20Anderson%20%28baseball%29">Josh Anderson</a> to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher <a href="Rudy%20Darrow">Rudy Darrow</a> on March 30, 2009.

On June 3, 2009, the Braves acquired <a href="Nate%20McLouth">Nate McLouth</a> from the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> for prospects <a href="Jeff%20Locke%20%28baseball%29">Jeff Locke</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Morton%20%28pitcher%29">Charlie Morton</a> and <a href="Gorkys%20Hern%C3%A1ndez">Gorkys Hernández</a>. They also released veteran pitcher Tom Glavine. On July 10, 2009, the Braves traded outfielder <a href="Jeff%20Francoeur">Jeff Francoeur</a> to the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> for outfielder <a href="Ryan%20Church">Ryan Church</a>. On July 31, 2009, hours before the trade deadline, the Braves and Boston Red Sox swapped 1st basemen: Atlanta dealt <a href="Casey%20Kotchman">Casey Kotchman</a> to Boston and reacquired <a href="Adam%20LaRoche">Adam LaRoche</a>, whom the Braves had traded away during the 2006–07 off-season to Pittsburgh.

The Braves made a late-season surge, coming within 2 games of the wild card leading <a href="2009%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season">Colorado Rockies</a> in late September. On October 1, 2009 with the Braves four games back, Colorado beat the <a href="2009%20Milwaukee%20Brewers%20season">Milwaukee Brewers</a> 9–2 to clinch the wild card spot and end the Braves' 2009 postseason hopes.

The 2010 Atlanta Braves Season features the Braves' attempt to reclaim a <a href="postseason">postseason</a> berth for the first time since <a href="2005%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">2005</a>. The Braves were once again skippered by <a href="Bobby%20Cox">Bobby Cox</a>, now in his 25th and final season managing the team. The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since <a href="2000%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">2000</a> when they won 16 in a row. On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> at <a href="Turner%20Field">Turner Field</a> to take sole possession of first place in the <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a> standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August. The last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in <a href="2005%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">2005</a>. On July 13, 2010 at the <a href="2010%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game">2010 MLB All-Star Game</a> in <a href="Anaheim">Anaheim</a>, Braves catcher <a href="Brian%20McCann%20%28baseball%29">Brian McCann</a> was awarded the <a href="MLB%20All-Star%20Game%20MVP%20Award">All-Star Game MVP Award</a> for his clutch two-out, three-run double in the seventh inning to give the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> its first win in the All-Star Game since <a href="1996%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game">1996</a>. He became the first Brave to win the All-Star Game MVP Award since <a href="Fred%20McGriff">Fred McGriff</a> did so in 1994. The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire <a href="%C3%81lex%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%28shortstop%2C%20born%201977%29">Álex González</a>, <a href="Rick%20Ankiel">Rick Ankiel</a> and <a href="Kyle%20Farnsworth">Kyle Farnsworth</a> from the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> and <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a>, giving up shortstop <a href="Yunel%20Escobar">Yunel Escobar</a>, pitchers <a href="Jo-Jo%20Reyes">Jo-Jo Reyes</a> and <a href="Jesse%20Chavez">Jesse Chavez</a>, outfielder <a href="Gregor%20Blanco">Gregor Blanco</a> and three minor leaguers. On August 18, 2010 they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman <a href="Derrek%20Lee">Derrek Lee</a> from the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>. On August 22, 2010 against the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, <a href="Mike%20Minor%20%28baseball%29">Mike Minor</a> struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record. The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September, but won the NL Wild Card. They lost to the <a href="2010%20San%20Francisco%20Giants%20season">San Francisco Giants</a> in the <a href="2010%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">National League Division Series</a> in four games. Every game of the series was determined by one run. After the series-clinching victory for the Giants in Game 4, Bobby Cox was given a standing ovation by the fans, also by players and coaches of both the Braves and Giants.

On October 13, 2010, the Atlanta Braves announced that <a href="Fredi%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Fredi González</a> would replace long-time Braves manager <a href="Bobby%20Cox">Bobby Cox</a> as manager of the team in 2011. The announcement came just two days after the <a href="2010%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">2010 Braves</a> were eliminated from the postseason. It was also announced that pitching coach <a href="Roger%20McDowell">Roger McDowell</a>, third-base coach <a href="Brian%20Snitker">Brian Snitker</a>, and bullpen coach <a href="Eddie%20P%C3%A9rez%20%28baseball%29">Eddie Pérez</a> would retain their current positions, while former hitting coach <a href="Terry%20Pendleton">Terry Pendleton</a> would replace <a href="Glenn%20Hubbard%20%28baseball%29">Glenn Hubbard</a> as the first-base coach and newcomer <a href="Carlos%20Tosca">Carlos Tosca</a> would become the new bench coach. Hubbard and former bench coach <a href="Chino%20Cadahia">Chino Cadahia</a> were not offered positions on the new coaching staff. <a href="Larry%20Parrish">Larry Parrish</a> was hired as hitting coach on October 29, 2010.

On November 16, 2010 in an offseason trade, the Braves acquired <a href="Dan%20Uggla">Dan Uggla</a> from the Florida Marlins in exchange for left-handed reliever <a href="Mike%20Dunn%20%28baseball%29">Mike Dunn</a> and infielder <a href="Omar%20Infante">Omar Infante</a>. According to <a href="Elias%20Sports%20Bureau">Elias Sports Bureau</a>, the Braves had an all-time franchise win-loss record over .500 for the first time since 1923 after their win over the <a href="2011%20Houston%20Astros%20season">Houston Astros</a> on June 11, 2011. The Braves franchise became the third franchise in MLB history to reach 10,000 wins with their win over the <a href="2011%20Washington%20Nationals%20season">Washington Nationals</a> on July 15, 2011. On July 31, 2011, just sixteen days after registering their 10,000th win, the <a href="2011%20Florida%20Marlins%20season">Florida Marlins</a> defeated the Braves by a score of 3–1, handing the team the 10,000th loss in franchise history. The Braves become only the second team in big league history with 10,000 losses after the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> reached the plateau in 2007.

Players from the Braves' farm system, such as <a href="Freddie%20Freeman">Freddie Freeman</a> and <a href="Brandon%20Beachy">Brandon Beachy</a>, played regularly with the big league club, while <a href="Julio%20Teher%C3%A1n">Julio Teherán</a>, <a href="Randall%20Delgado">Randall Delgado</a>, and <a href="Mike%20Minor%20%28baseball%29">Mike Minor</a> were called up for spot starts. With late season injuries to starters <a href="Jair%20Jurrjens">Jair Jurrjens</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Hanson">Tommy Hanson</a>, these three young pitchers made their way into the starting rotation in their absence. Eight players made their major league debuts for the team in 2011.

The Braves led the <a href="List%20of%20National%20League%20Wild%20Card%20winners">National League Wild Card</a> standings for much of the 2011 season, with the division-rival <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> firmly in control of first place in the <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a>. The Braves entered the final month of the regular season 25 games above .500 with a record of 80–55 and an -game lead in the Wild Card standings. The nearest team trailing them, the <a href="2011%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, who also trailed the <a href="National%20League%20Central">National League Central</a>-leading <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> by games at the time, were considered a long-shot to gain a spot in the postseason. Just days prior on August 26, the Cardinals found themselves games behind and in third place.

With 27 games to play, the Braves went 9–18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89–73. The Cardinals, meanwhile, went 18–8 to finish at 90–72. Braves closer <a href="Craig%20Kimbrel">Craig Kimbrel</a>, who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August, carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves. After being dominant in his role for much of the season, Braves setup man <a href="Jonny%20Venters">Jonny Venters</a> posted a 5.11 September ERA. These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by Braves manager <a href="Fredi%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Fredi González</a>. Veteran starter <a href="Derek%20Lowe">Derek Lowe</a> posted a <a href="win-loss%20record">win-loss record</a> of 0–5 in September with an ERA of 8.75. Shortly into the offseason, Lowe would be traded to the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. The Braves starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games. Over the last five games, all of which were losses for the Braves, the team managed to score only seven runs. Braves catcher <a href="Brian%20McCann%20%28baseball%29">Brian McCann</a>, often regarded as the best offensive catcher in the Majors, hit only .183 with two home runs in September. The offense as a whole hit for only a .235 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> and a .300 <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> in September, both second-worst in the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>. The .195 <a href="Scoring%20position">RISP</a> average by Braves hitters was second worst in the Majors. Hitting coach <a href="Larry%20Parrish">Larry Parrish</a> was fired two days following the last game of the season.

In 2012, the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season. On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman <a href="Chipper%20Jones">Chipper Jones</a> would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team. The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher <a href="Derek%20Lowe">Derek Lowe</a>, shortstop <a href="%C3%81lex%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%28shortstop%2C%20born%201977%29">Alex González</a>, and outfielder <a href="Nate%20McLouth">Nate McLouth</a>. To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder <a href="Michael%20Bourn">Michael Bourn</a>, along with shortstops <a href="Tyler%20Pastornicky">Tyler Pastornicky</a> and <a href="Andrelton%20Simmons">Andrelton Simmons</a>. To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by Lowe (as well as a mid-season injury to <a href="Brandon%20Beachy">Brandon Beachy</a>), manager Fredi González elected relief pitcher <a href="Kris%20Medlen">Kris Medlen</a> to the starting pitching rotation. The Braves went on to win every game Medlen started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23). Atlanta stayed close to the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> in the race to win the National League East title. They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race. Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild card race. Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a <a href="2012%20National%20League%20Wild%20Card%20Game">playoff game</a> before entering into the <a href="Division%20Series">Division Series</a>.

The Braves played the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the first ever <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Wild%20Card%20Game">Wild Card Game</a>. The Braves were behind 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when Andrelton Simmons hit a fly ball to left field that dropped in between the Cardinals shortstop and left fielder. Umpire <a href="Sam%20Holbrook">Sam Holbrook</a> called Simmons out, citing the <a href="infield%20fly%20rule">infield fly rule</a>. Had an infield fly not been called, Simmons would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out. Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes. The Braves lost the game 6–3, ending their season.

During the offseason following a gut wrenching exit against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Wild%20Card%20Game">Wild Card Game</a>, the Braves spent the 2012–2013 offseason revamping and retooling their offense. The Braves turned heads across baseball by acquiring <a href="B.J.%20Upton">B.J. Upton</a> from the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a>, signing him to a 5-year $75.25 million contract and making him their starting center fielder, and uniting him with his younger brother <a href="Justin%20Upton">Justin Upton</a> from the <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> in a seven player trade that sent fan favorite utility man <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Prado">Martín Prado</a> to the Diamondbacks, they also filled a need for a new Third Baseman in <a href="Chris%20Johnson%20%28baseball%29">Chris Johnson</a> after the retirement of <a href="Chipper%20Jones">Chipper Jones</a> the previous year. The Braves began the 2013 season with a hot start in April by going 17–9 for the month, which saw the emergence of rookie sensation <a href="Evan%20Gattis">Evan Gattis</a>, while taking hold of first place in the <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a> division, a lead they would never relinquish for the rest of the season. The Braves suffered many injuries to key players throughout the season, including injuries to <a href="Jason%20Heyward">Jason Heyward</a>, <a href="Brian%20McCann%20%28baseball%29">Brian McCann</a>, <a href="Freddie%20Freeman">Freddie Freeman</a>, <a href="Eric%20O%27Flaherty">Eric O'Flaherty</a>, <a href="Jonny%20Venters">Jonny Venters</a>, <a href="Ramiro%20Pena">Ramiro Pena</a> and others, but found a way to win despite these blows to the team. Leading up to the All Star break, First Baseman Freddie Freeman was voted in to play for the 2013 National League All-Star Team, in the 2013 All Star Game, which he did not play. The Braves also witnessed the emergence of rookie pitcher <a href="Julio%20Teher%C3%A1n">Julio Teherán</a> after much hype during Spring training. From July 26 to August 10, the Braves won 14 games in a row. The winning streak was the longest of its kind since April–May 2000.

On June 28, 2013 the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman Chipper Jones' jersey, number 10, before the game against the <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>. He was honored before 51,300 fans at <a href="Turner%20Field">Turner Field</a> in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. He served as a staple of the Braves franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season. <a href="Chipper%20Jones">Chipper Jones</a> played his last regular season game for the Braves on September 30, 2012.

The Braves opened up a 15-game lead on the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> in the <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a> on September 3, 2013, riding that lead en route to its first division title since 2005, the last of 14 straight division titles. This was also Braves manager <a href="Fredi%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Fredi González</a>'s first division title since beginning his managerial career in 1990; including his first since becoming the manager of the Braves after the 2010 season. The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22, 2013 after a Nationals loss to the Marlins in the first game of a double header; the Braves also won their game that day, beating the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> 5–2 at <a href="Wrigley%20Field">Wrigley Field</a>.

After clinching the division title, they lost to the Dodgers 3–1 in the Division Series.

On November 11, 2013, the Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field for a <a href="SunTrust%20Park">new stadium</a> in <a href="Cobb%20County">Cobb County</a>, in the northwest suburbs outside of Atlanta in 2017. The move is to follow the expiration of the Braves' 20-year lease on Turner Field in 2016. The new stadium is to be constructed in a public/private partnership. During the offseason the Braves signed few of their young talents to multi year contracts; Craig Kimbrel (4 years/$42M), Freddie Freeman (8 years/$135M), Kris Medlen (1 year/$5.8M), Jason Heyward (2 years/$13.3M), Julio Teherán (6 years/$32.4M) and Andrelton Simmons (7 years/$58M).

The Braves finished the season in a distant second place with a 79–83 record, which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990.

Prior to the 2015 season, the Braves fired their General Manager <a href="Frank%20Wren">Frank Wren</a>, and <a href="John%20Hart%20%28baseball%29">John Hart</a> replaced him as interim general manager, choosing to only take the title of President of Baseball Operations. The Braves promptly traded <a href="Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Glove Award</a> winner <a href="Jason%20Heyward">Jason Heyward</a> to the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> along with pitcher <a href="Jordan%20Walden">Jordan Walden</a> for pitchers <a href="Shelby%20Miller">Shelby Miller</a> and <a href="Tyrell%20Jenkins">Tyrell Jenkins</a>. Hart would then trade All Star left fielder <a href="Justin%20Upton">Justin Upton</a> to the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a> for <a href="Max%20Fried">Max Fried</a>, <a href="Jace%20Peterson">Jace Peterson</a>, <a href="Dustin%20Peterson">Dustin Peterson</a>, and <a href="Mallex%20Smith">Mallex Smith</a>. Catcher <a href="Evan%20Gattis">Evan Gattis</a> and minor league <a href="Prospect%20%28sports%29">prospect</a> <a href="James%20Hoyt%20%28baseball%29">James Hoyt</a> were traded to the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> for minor leaguers <a href="Mike%20Foltynewicz">Mike Foltynewicz</a>, <a href="Rio%20Ruiz">Rio Ruiz</a>, and <a href="Andrew%20Thurman">Andrew Thurman</a>. A day before the season began, the Braves made a final trade involving former All- Star <a href="Craig%20Kimbrel">Craig Kimbrel</a> and outfielder <a href="Melvin%20Upton%20Jr.">Melvin Upton Jr.</a>. They were traded to the San Diego Padres for outfielders <a href="Cameron%20Maybin">Cameron Maybin</a> and <a href="Carlos%20Quentin">Carlos Quentin</a> along with two minor league players. By the beginning of the season, the Braves did 11 trades in all.

Prior to the start of the 2016 regular season, the Braves continued their offseason rebuilding by trading <a href="Andrelton%20Simmons">Andrelton Simmons</a> to the Los Angeles Angels for <a href="Erick%20Aybar">Erick Aybar</a>, and pitching prospects <a href="Sean%20Newcomb">Sean Newcomb</a> and <a href="Chris%20Ellis%20%28baseball%29">Chris Ellis</a> and $2.5 million. They agreed to 1 year contracts with <a href="Kelly%20Johnson%20%28baseball%29">Kelly Johnson</a>, <a href="Chris%20Withrow">Chris Withrow</a>, and <a href="Arodys%20Vizcaino">Arodys Vizcaino</a>, and agreed to terms on a minor league contract for <a href="Carlos%20Torres%20%28pitcher%29">Carlos Torres</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Francoeur">Jeff Francoeur</a>. The Braves would end up purchasing the Major League contract of Francoeur.

On April 13, 2016, Hector Olivera was arrested and charged with the assault of a woman at the team hotel when the Braves were in Washington D.C. facing the Nationals. He was placed on Administrative Leave by Major League Baseball and was placed on the Braves Restricted List until further disciplinary action is given.

The Braves began the season on a nine-game losing streak, which is the worst opening by the franchise since 1988, when they dropped the first 10 games of that season.

After a 9–28 start in 2016, Fredi González was fired on May 17 and replaced by third base coach <a href="Brian%20Snitker">Brian Snitker</a> as interim general manager. Snitker replaced González once before in the 2006–07 off-season as the Braves third base coach when González left the Braves to manage the Marlins.

The Braves finished the season 68–93 and in last place in NL East.

During the 2016 off-season, the Braves signed pitchers <a href="R.A.%20Dickey">R.A. Dickey</a> and <a href="Bartolo%20Col%C3%B3n">Bartolo Colón</a> and promoted interim manager <a href="Brian%20Snitker">Brian Snitker</a> to full-time manager.

The Braves opened their new stadium, <a href="SunTrust%20Park">SunTrust Park</a>, on April 14, 2017 with a four-game sweep of the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a>.

Over its 138 seasons, the Braves franchise has won a total of three <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> Championships, one in each of the three cities they have played in.

The Braves–Mets rivalry is a rivalry between the two teams, featuring the Braves and the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> as they both play in the <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a>.

Although their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the <a href="1969%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">1969 NLCS</a>, en route to their first World Series championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1994 season when division realignment put both the Mets and the Braves in the NL East division. During this time the Braves became one of the most dominant teams in professional baseball, earning 14 straight division titles through 2005, including five world series berths, and one world series championship during the 1995 season. The rivalry remained heated through the early 2000s.

While their rivalry with the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> lacks the history and hatred of the Mets, it has been the more important one in the last decade. Between 1993 and 2013, the two teams reigned almost exclusively as NL East champions, the exceptions being in 2006, when the Mets won their first division title since <a href="1988%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">1988</a> (no division titles were awarded in 1994 due to the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">player's strike</a>), and in 2012, when the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> claimed their <a href="National%20League%20East%23NL%20East%20champions%20by%20year">first division title since 1981</a> when playing as the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a>. The Phillies 1993 championship was also part of a four-year reign of exclusive division championships by the Phillies and the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, their <a href="Phillies%E2%80%93Pirates%20rivalry">in-state rivals</a>. While rivalries are generally characterized by mutual hatred, the Braves and Phillies deeply respect each other. Each game played (18 games in 2011) is vastly important between these two NL East giants, but at the end of the day, they are very similar organizations. Overall, the Braves have one more <a href="National%20League%20East%23Most%20Division%20Titles">National League East division title</a> than the Phillies, having won 12 times each since 1969, with the Braves holding it for eleven consecutive years from 1995 through 2005.

The Braves currently have five different game <a href="baseball%20uniform">baseball uniform</a> combinations. The home uniforms consist of a standard white uniform, a red, military appreciation jersey worn with the standard white pants, and a cream alternate uniform. The road uniforms consist of a standard gray uniform, and an alternate navy blue jersey worn with the standard gray pants.

The white home uniform, introduced in 1987, is the primary home uniform. The jersey has "Braves" written in script across the chest with the tomahawk logo underneath. The jersey also includes piping around the collar and down the front of the jersey and around the bottom of the sleeves. Player numbers appear on the back of the jersey with a nameplate above. The Braves script, player numbers, and piping are red with a navy blue border. The tomahawk is primarily red with blue and yellow detail and a navy blue border. The white pants have identical piping to the jersey about the belt loops and down the outside seam of the pants. The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a white nameplate. The player names originally used vertically arched lettering but, since 2006, the team has used radially arched lettering. The white uniform is paired with the standard home cap. It is a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a white embroidered "script A" logo. The home batting helmet is identical to the primary home cap.

The gray road uniforms are the primary road uniform. The uniforms are identical to the white home uniforms with the exception of the "Braves" script, which is replaced by the "Atlanta" script. Player names are sewn to a gray nameplate. The primary uniforms are very similar to the uniforms that the Braves wore from 1946 to 1965—during their latter years in Boston and throughout their tenure in Milwaukee.

The red, military appreciation jersey was introduced on February 5, 2014. The jerseys feature navy blue piping with a white border, the Braves script in blue with white stars, and the American Flag on the left sleeve. The updated red jerseys will not include the tomahawk logo. The jerseys will be worn for five home games in 2014: April 26 vs. the Cincinnati Reds (military family night), June 13 vs. the LA Angels of Anaheim (celebrating the Army), July 26 vs. the San Diego Padres (celebrating the Marines), Aug. 30 vs. the Miami Marlins (celebrating the Navy), and September 19 vs. NY Mets (celebrating the Air Force). The jerseys will be paired with camouflage caps. The military appreciation jerseys replace the red jerseys introduced in 2005. Worn with the white pants, these jerseys included the same elements as the white jerseys, with the Braves script, player numbers, and piping in navy blue with a white border. The tomahawk was primarily blue, with red and yellow detail and a white border. The player names consisted of white lettering sewn to a red nameplate. These jerseys were paired with an alternate home cap, which was a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a red, embroidered "script A" logo with a tomahawk, outlined in white. The alternate cap did not have a matching batting helmet. The red alternate jerseys were worn for Sunday home games from 2005 to 2011. The only exceptions to this were the opening game of the 2005 <a href="National%20League%20Division%20Series">NLDS</a>, which was played on a Wednesday, and on Memorial Day in 2006. The 2006 Memorial Day game is also the only time the red jerseys were paired with the primary home cap. With the introduction of the cream uniform in 2012, the red jerseys were worn for Friday night home games from 2012 to 2013. However, the Braves chose to wear the traditional white jerseys for their 2012 home opener, which took place on Friday, April 13.

The cream alternate uniforms were introduced in February 2012 as a tribute to the Braves' first season in Atlanta in 1966. The jersey includes the "Braves" script across the breastplate, but the player number replaces the tomahawk underneath the "Braves" script on the left placket. Player numbers and the "Braves" script are in red with a navy blue border. The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a cream nameplate. The jersey has a thin, navy piping about the collar and down the front of the jersey. There is no piping around the sleeves. The cream pants include piping identical to the jersey down the outside seam. The left sleeve of the jersey has a "crossed tomahawk" logo that replaces the "screaming Indian" logo that appeared on the 1966 jerseys. The new logo has two, primarily red, crossed tomahawks. Underneath the tomahawks is a blue circle outlined in red, with "1876" in red above (commemorating the year the franchise was founded), and "Atlanta Braves" in white below. The cream uniforms are paired with the standard home cap and are worn for Saturday and Sunday home games.

The alternate navy blue road jerseys were introduced on opening night of the 2008 season against the Washington Nationals. Worn with the gray road pants, the jerseys feature the "Atlanta" script on the breastplate in navy blue with a white outline. The tomahawk is primarily navy blue with red and yellow detail and a white border. The player numbers are blue with white borders and the player names are white letters sewn to a navy blue nameplate. The navy blue jerseys have no piping either on the sleeves or around the collar.

From 1987 to 2008, the red brimmed, primary home cap was also worn on the road. However, when the navy blue jerseys were introduced in 2008, they were paired with a navy blue cap, similar to the team's road cap worn from 1966 to 1971. While the red brimmed cap was still primarily worn with the gray road uniforms, the team sometimes wore the navy blue cap with the gray jerseys, and the red brimmed cap was occasionally worn with the navy blue jerseys. The red brimmed home batting helmets were also worn on the road from 1987 through 2008. Beginning in 2009, the navy blue cap became the official road cap and was paired with a navy blue road batting helmet.

Unlike the home uniforms, which are worn based on a schedule, the road uniforms are chosen on game day by the starting pitcher. However, they are also subject to <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> rules requiring the road team to wear uniforms that contrast with the uniforms worn by the home team. Due to this rule, the gray uniforms are worn when the home team chooses to wear navy blue, and sometimes when the home team chooses to wear black.

From 1912 to 1989 the Braves logo consisted of the head of an Indian warrior. From 1912 to 1956 it was an Indian with a headdress, and thereafter a laughing Indian with a mohawk and one feather in his hair. In 1990 the logo was changed to just the word "Braves" in cursive with a tomahawk below it.


The Braves have retired eleven numbers in the history of the franchise, including most recently <a href="Chipper%20Jones">Chipper Jones</a>' number 10 in 2013, <a href="John%20Smoltz">John Smoltz</a>'s number 29 in 2012, <a href="Bobby%20Cox">Bobby Cox</a>'s number 6 in 2011, <a href="Tom%20Glavine">Tom Glavine</a>'s number 47 in 2010, and <a href="Greg%20Maddux">Greg Maddux</a>'s number 31 in 2009. Additionally, <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>'s 44, <a href="Dale%20Murphy">Dale Murphy</a>'s 3, <a href="Phil%20Niekro">Phil Niekro</a>'s 35, <a href="Eddie%20Mathews">Eddie Mathews</a>' 41, <a href="Warren%20Spahn">Warren Spahn</a>'s 21 and <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>'s 42, which is retired for all of baseball with the exception of <a href="Jackie%20Robinson%20Day">Jackie Robinson Day</a>, have also been retired. The color and design of the retired numbers reflect the uniform design at the time the person was on the team, excluding Robinson.
Of the ten Braves whose numbers have been retired, all who are eligible for the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> have been elected with the exception of Murphy, whose eligibility has expired. Jones is not eligible until 2018.

After years of stability, the Braves have faced a period of transition in their radio and television coverage.

The 2007 season was the last for Braves baseball on the <a href="TBS%20%28TV%20network%29">TBS Superstation</a>. TBS showed 70 games throughout the country, then cleared the decks to make way for a <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20TBS">new national broadcast package</a> that began in earnest with the 2007 postseason, and expanded to Sunday afternoon games in 2008. Until his dismissal in 2009, <a href="Chip%20Caray">Chip Caray</a>, one of the Braves' current broadcasters, called <a href="play-by-play">play-by-play</a> for the national package, which includes the <a href="Division%20Series">Division Series</a> every season and alternating coverage of the <a href="American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a> and <a href="National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NLCS</a>. Caray is joined by <a href="Joe%20Simpson%20%28baseball%29">Joe Simpson</a>, who has provided color commentary for the Braves since 1992.

Braves baseball had been on TBS since it was WTCG in 1972 and had been a cornerstone of the national superstation since it began in 1976. <a href="WPCH-TV">WPCH-TV/Peachtree TV</a>, formerly WTBS Atlanta, still carried Braves games after 2007, but only in parts of the Southern United States. After the transfer of the channel's operations from Time Warner to <a href="Meredith%20Corporation">Meredith Corporation</a>, all Peachtree TV games were simulcast on <a href="Fox%20Sports%20South">Fox Sports South</a> outside of the Peachtree TV coverage area in 2011 and 2012. On February 27, 2013, it was announced that Fox Sports South and SportSouth (now called <a href="Fox%20Sports%20Southeast">Fox Sports Southeast</a>) would carry every regionally televised Braves game exclusively, ending the team's partnership with WPCH-TV after 40 years.

After the 2004 season, longtime radio flagship station <a href="WSB%20%28AM%29">750 WSB</a> was replaced by <a href="WGST">WGST</a> 640AM. Due to WGST's weak signal at night, which fails to cover the entire <a href="Atlanta%20metropolitan%20area">Atlanta metropolitan area</a>, all games began to be simulcast on <a href="FM%20radio">FM radio</a> when the rights were transferred. The games first appeared on 96.1 <a href="WWPW">WKLS</a> (formerly "96 Rock") in 2005, but moved to <a href="country%20music">country music</a> station 94.9 <a href="WUBL">WUBL</a> ("94.9 The Bull") in 2007 after WKLS underwent a change in format from <a href="classic%20rock">classic rock</a> to <a href="active%20rock">active rock</a> and became <a href="WWPW">Project 9–6–1</a>. As of the 2009 season, the Braves returned to WKLS on the FM frequency but remained on WGST on AM. It was announced that for the 2010 season, the Braves will be flagshipped on <a href="WCNN">WCNN</a> 680 The Fan and in Atlanta on the AM dial and <a href="WNNX">WNNX</a> 100.5 FM.

The Atlanta Braves radio network currently serves 134 radio stations across the Southern United States, including 20 in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, 4 in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, 68 in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, 1 in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, 13 in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, 14 in <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, and 14 in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>.

Since 2009, the radio announcers have been former Brewers announcer <a href="Jim%20Powell%20%28sportscaster%29">Jim Powell</a> and <a href="Don%20Sutton">Don Sutton</a>. Sutton was released after the <a href="2006%20in%20baseball">2006 season</a> and called <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> games on television from 2007 to 2008, but he has since returned for the 2009 season. Longtime Braves voices <a href="Skip%20Caray">Skip Caray</a> and <a href="Pete%20Van%20Wieren">Pete Van Wieren</a> were the primary play-by-play voices of Braves baseball until Skip's sudden death on August 3, 2008, and Van Wieren's retirement after the 2008 season.

Atari ST

The Atari ST is a line of <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>s from <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corporation</a> and the successor to the <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a>. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in April-June 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bitmapped color <a href="GUI">GUI</a>, using a version of <a href="Digital%20Research">Digital Research</a>'s <a href="Graphics%20Environment%20Manager">GEM</a> released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a> of <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a> in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US$1.

The Atari ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>s that have 16 or 32-bit processors, 256 <a href="Kibibyte">KiB</a> or more of RAM, and <a href="computer%20mouse">mouse</a>-controlled graphical user interfaces. It includes the <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a>, <a href="Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a>, <a href="Apple%20IIGS">Apple IIGS</a>, and, in certain markets, the <a href="Acorn%20Archimedes">Acorn Archimedes</a>. "ST" officially stands for "Sixteen/Thirty-two", which refers to the <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a>'s <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> external bus and <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> internals.

The ST was sold with either Atari's color monitor or the less expensive <a href="monochrome%20monitor">monochrome monitor</a>. The system's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor.

In some markets, particularly <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, the machine gained a strong foothold as a <a href="small%20business">small business</a> machine for <a href="CAD">CAD</a> and <a href="desktop%20publishing">desktop publishing</a> work. Thanks to its built-in <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> ports, the ST enjoyed success for running <a href="music%20sequencer">music-sequencer</a> software and as a <a href="MIDI%20controller">controller</a> of <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a>s among both amateurs and well-known musicians.

The ST was superseded by the <a href="Atari%20STE">Atari STE</a>, <a href="Atari%20TT">Atari TT</a>, <a href="Atari%20MEGA%20STE">Atari MEGA STE</a>, and <a href="Atari%20Falcon">Falcon</a> computers.

The Atari ST was born from the rivalry between home-computer makers <a href="Atari%2C%20Inc.">Atari, Inc.</a> and <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore International</a>.

<a href="Jay%20Miner">Jay Miner</a>, one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> and <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a>, tried to convince Atari management to create a new chipset for a video game console and computer. When his idea was rejected, Miner left Atari to form a small <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a> called Hi-Toro in 1982 and began designing the new "Lorraine" chipset. The company, which was later renamed <a href="Amiga%20Corporation">Amiga Corporation</a>, was pretending to sell video game controllers to deceive competition while it developed a Lorraine-based computer.

Amiga ran out of capital to complete Lorraine's development, and Atari, owned by <a href="Warner%20Communications">Warner Communications</a>, paid Amiga to continue development work. In return Atari received exclusive use of the Lorraine design for one year as a video game console. After one year Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market the complete computer, designated the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named "Mickey", and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed "Minnie".

After leaving <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore International</a> in January 1984, <a href="Jack%20Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a> formed Tramel Technology with his sons and other ex-Commodore employees and, in April, began planning a new computer. The company initially considered the <a href="National%20Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a> <a href="NS320xx">NS320xx</a> microprocessor but was disappointed with its performance. This started the move to the 68000. The lead designer of the Atari ST was ex-Commodore employee <a href="Shiraz%20Shivji">Shiraz Shivji</a>, who had previously worked on the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>'s development.

Tramiel learned that Warner wanted to sell Atari which, in mid-1984, was losing about a million dollars per day. Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer, Tramiel negotiated with Warner in May and June 1984. He secured funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July. As executives and engineers left Commodore to join Tramiel's new <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corporation</a>, Commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets.

The Tramiels did not purchase the employee contracts when they bought the assets of Atari Inc., so one of their first acts was to interview Atari Inc. employees to decide whom to hire at what was essentially a brand new company. This company was originally called TTL (Tramiel Technologies Limited), later renamed to Atari Corp. At the time of the purchase of Atari Inc's assets, there were roughly 900 employees remaining from a high point of 10,000. After the interviews, approximately 100 employees were hired to work at Atari Corp.

At one point a custom sound processor called AMY was a planned component for the new ST computer design, but the chip needed more time to complete, so AMY was dropped in favor of an off-the-shelf Yamaha sound chip.

It was during this time in late July/early August that Leonard Tramiel discovered the original Amiga contract, which required Amiga Corporation to deliver the Lorraine chipset to Atari on June 30, 1984. Amiga Corp. had sought more monetary support from investors in spring 1984 (among them Tramel Technology, which wished to replace nearly everyone at Amiga).

Having heard rumors that Tramiel was negotiating to buy Atari, Amiga Corp. entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga Corporation outright, which Commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts, including Atari's. Instead of Amiga Corp. delivering Lorraine to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari on Amiga's behalf, in effect returning the funds Atari invested into Amiga for the chipset. Tramiel countersued Amiga Corp. on August 13, 1984. He sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with its technology.

At Commodore, the Amiga team was in limbo during the summer of 1984 because of the lawsuit. No word on the status of the chipset, the Lorraine computer, or the team's fate was known. In the fall of 1984, Commodore informed the team that the Lorraine project was active again, the chipset was to be improved, the <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> (OS) developed, and the hardware design completed. While Commodore announced the <a href="Amiga%201000">Amiga 1000</a> with the Lorraine chipset in July 1985, the delay gave Atari, with its many former Commodore engineers, time to deliver the first Atari ST units in June 1985. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision.

With the hardware design nearing completion, the Atari team started looking at solutions for the <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>. Soon after the Atari buyout, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> approached Tramiel with the suggestion that they port <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> to the platform, but the delivery date was out by two years, far too long for their needs. Another possibility was <a href="Digital%20Research">Digital Research</a>, who was working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become <a href="Graphics%20Environment%20Manager">GEM</a>. Another option was to write a new operating system in-house, but this was rejected as Atari management was unsure whether the company had the required expertise to do so.

Digital Research was fully committed to the Intel platform, so a team from Atari was sent to the Digital Research headquarters to work with the "Monterey Team" which comprised a mixture of Atari and Digital Research engineers. Atari's Leonard Tramiel was the Atari person overseeing "Project Jason" (a.k.a.  The Operating System) for the Atari ST line of computers. The name came from the original designer and developer, Jason Loveman.

GEM was based on CP/M-68K, essentially a direct port of <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> to the 68000. By 1985, CP/M was becoming increasingly outdated; it did not support sub-directories, for example. Digital Research was also in the process of building a new <a href="DOS">DOS</a>-like operating system specifically for GEM, "GEMDOS", and there was some discussion of whether or not a port of GEMDOS could be completed in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEMDOS file system which became part of <a href="Atari%20TOS">Atari TOS</a> ("The Operating System" and colloquially known as the "Tramiel Operating System"). This gave the ST a fast, hierarchical file system, essential for hard drives, plus programmers had function calls similar to <a href="IBM%20PC%20DOS">IBM PC DOS</a>. The <a href="Atari%20ST%20character%20set">character set</a> is based on <a href="codepage%20437">codepage 437</a>.

Besides the original TOS operating system, a number of third-party OSes were developed or ported to the Atari ST. Among Unix clones, <a href="Idris%20%28operating%20system%29">Idris</a>, <a href="Minix">Minix</a> had an Atari ST port and the <a href="MiNT">Mint</a> OS was developed specifically for the Atari ST.

After six months of intensive effort following Tramiel's takeover, Atari announced the 520ST at the Winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a> in January 1985. "InfoWorld" described prototypes shown at computer shows as a "typical Commodore-64-style, corner-cutting, low-cost Jack Tramiel product", but Atari unexpectedly displayed the ST at Atlanta <a href="COMDEX">COMDEX</a> in May. Due to its similarities to the original <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> and Tramiel's role in its development, it was quickly nicknamed the Jackintosh. Atari's rapid development of the ST amazed many, but others were more skeptical, citing the ST's "cheap" appearance, Atari's uncertain financial health, and the poor relations the Tramiel-led Commodore had with software developers.

As early as 1981, <a href="Adam%20Osborne">Adam Osborne</a> wrote that while Tramiel "deserves credit for what he has been able to accomplish", "the microcomputer industry abounds with horror stories describing the way Commodore treats its dealers and its customers." In 1984 "<a href="Ahoy%21">Ahoy!</a>" had written that Tramiel "had never been able to establish very good relations with computer dealers ... Under his reign, computer retailers have accused Commodore of treating them as harshly as if they were suppliers or competitors". After purchasing Atari, "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" stated that his poor reputation likely made computer stores reluctant to deal with the company, hurting its distribution of the ST. One retailer said, "If you can believe <a href="Lucy%20Van%20Pelt">Lucy</a> when she holds the football for <a href="Charlie%20Brown">Charlie Brown</a>, you can believe Jack Tramiel", and another said that because of its experience with Tramiel "Our interest in Atari is zero, zilch". Neither Atari nor Commodore was able to persuade large chains like <a href="ComputerLand">ComputerLand</a> or BusinessLand to sell their products, but observers criticized Atari's erratic discussion of its stated plans for the new computer, quickly shifting from using <a href="mass%20merchandiser">mass merchandiser</a>s to specialty computer stores to both; Atari executives could not name any computer stores that would carry the ST when asked at COMDEX. One analyst stated after attending a meeting with the company, "We've seen marketing strategies changed before our eyes".

Although the more than 30 companies exhibiting ST software at Las Vegas COMDEX in November 1985—while the Amiga had almost none—surprised the industry, Tramiel's poor reputation also influenced potential developers of software for his computer. One stated that "Dealing with Commodore was like dealing with Attila the Hun. I don't know if Tramiel will be following his old habits ... I don't see a lot of people rushing to get software on the machine." Large business-software companies like <a href="Lotus%20Development">Lotus</a>, <a href="Ashton-Tate">Ashton-Tate</a>, and Microsoft did not promise software for either the ST or Amiga, and the majority of software companies were hesitant to support another platform beyond the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>, Apple, and <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>; "These days, if I were a consumer, I'd stick to companies [Apple and IBM] <a href="orphaned%20technology">I know will be around</a>", said <a href="Philippe%20Kahn">Philippe Kahn</a> of <a href="Borland">Borland</a>. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported after Atlanta COMDEX that "more than 100 software titles will be available for the [ST], most written by small software houses that desperately need work", and contrasted the "small, little-known companies" at Las Vegas with the larger ones like <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="Activision">Activision</a> which planned Amiga programs.

<a href="Trip%20Hawkins">Trip Hawkins</a> of Electronic Arts said "I don't think Atari understands the software business. I'm still skeptical about its resources and its credibility." Although <a href="Michael%20Berlyn">Michael Berlyn</a> of <a href="Infocom">Infocom</a> promised that his company would quickly publish all of its games for the new computer, he doubted that many others would soon do so. Other companies such as <a href="Spinnaker%20Software">Spinnaker Software</a> and <a href="Lifetree%20Software">Lifetree Software</a> were more positive. Both promised to soon release ST software, with the former reporting that "Atari has a vastly improved attitude toward software developers. They are eager to give us technical support and machines", and the latter stating "we are giving Atari high priority". Some, such as <a href="Software%20Publishing%20Corporation">Software Publishing Corporation</a>, were unsure of whether to develop for the ST or the Amiga, while <a href="John%20C.%20Dvorak">John C. Dvorak</a> wrote that the public saw both Commodore and Atari as selling "cheap disposable" game machines, in part because of their computers' sophisticated graphics.

Atari ST advertisements stated "America, We Built It For You", and quoted Atari president Sam Tramiel: "We promised. We delivered. With pride, determination, and good old ATARI know how". Although Atari was out of cash, sales of its <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> computers were "very, very slow" according to Jack Tramiel, and employees feared that he would shut the company down, the 520ST shipped during spring 1985 to the press, developers, and <a href="user%20group">user group</a>s, and in early July 1985 for general retail sales, saving the company. By November the company stated that it had sold more than 50 thousand 520STs, "with U.S. sales alone well into five figures". As with the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a>, conversions of popular Atari arcade games were a major factor in the Atari ST's success. The machine had gone from concept to store shelves in a little under a year. Atari had originally intended to release versions with 128 KB and 256 KB of RAM as the "130ST" and "260ST" respectively. However, with the OS loaded from floppy into RAM, there would be little or no room left over for applications to run. The 260ST did make its way into Europe on a limited basis.

The ST supports a <a href="monochrome%20monitor">monochrome</a> or color monitor. The color hardware supports two different resolutions, 320 × 200 with 16 out of 512 colors, or 640 × 200 with 4 out of 512 colors. The monochrome monitor was less expensive and has a single resolution of 640 × 400 at 70 Hz. The attached monitor determines available resolutions, so software either supports both types of monitors or only works with one. Color is required by a majority of games. Unlike the Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari's own 8-bit computers, the ST does not have hardware-supported <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprite</a>s.

Early models shipped with Atari Logo and "TOS" on disk; although the operating system occupies 206K RAM, but models were designed with six <a href="read-only%20memory">ROM</a> sockets allow easy upgrading to the future ROM-based "TOS". These became available only a few months later and were included in all new machines as well as being available as an upgrade for older machines. By late 1985 the machines were also upgraded with the addition of an <a href="RF%20modulator">RF modulator</a> (for TV display), a version known as the 520ST. ST systems before the Mega ST range have no battery-backed clock.

Atari had originally intended to include GEM's GDOS (Graphical Device Operating System), which allowed programs to send GEM VDI (<a href="Virtual%20Device%20Interface">Virtual Device Interface</a>) commands to drivers loaded by GDOS. This allowed developers to send VDI instructions to other <a href="Device%20file">devices</a> simply by pointing to it. However, GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping and was included in software packages and later ST machines. Later versions of GDOS supported vector fonts.
A limited set of GEM fonts were also included within the ROMs. These fonts also feature a standard 8x8 pixel graphical character set for the ST (the main in-ROM "font" for GEM and text-mode TOS operations in color modes) containing standard numbers, letters, symbols, accented characters, and four unusual characters which can be placed together in a square, forming a facsimile of the face of <a href="J.%20R.%20%26quot%3BBob%26quot%3B%20Dobbs">J. R. "Bob" Dobbs</a> (the figurehead of the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Subgenius">Church of the Subgenius</a>).

The ST was less expensive than most machines, including the <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Macintosh Plus</a>, and tended to be faster than most. Largely as a result of the price/performance factor, the ST would go on to be a fairly popular machine, notably in European markets where the foreign-exchange rates amplified prices. Indeed, the company's English advertising strapline of the era was "power without the price". In fact, an Atari ST and <a href="terminal%20emulation">terminal emulation</a> software was much cheaper than a <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">Digital</a> <a href="VT220">VT220</a> terminal, which was commonly needed by offices with central computers.

The original 520ST case design was created by Ira Velinsky Atari's chief Industrial Designer. The ST is basically wedge-shaped, featuring bold angular lines and a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The keyboard has soft tactile feedback and rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. The 520ST is an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, but with a larger keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad.

The 520ST uses an external <a href="power%20brick">power brick</a>.

The 520ST features a large number of ports mounted at the rear of the machine that remained largely unchanged over the ST's history.


Because of its <a href="parallel%20communication">bi-directional</a> design, the Centronics printer port can be used for joystick input, and several games make use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports.

Atari initially used single-sided <a href="floppy%20disk">disk drives</a> that could store up to 360 kB. Later drives were double-sided and stored 720 kB. Some commercial software, particularly games, shipped by default on single-sided disks, even supplying two 360kB floppies instead of a single double-sided one, for fear of alienating <a href="early%20adopter">early adopter</a>s.

Another sticking point with the ST's floppy drives was that, whilst double-sided drive equipped STs could happily read discs formatted under <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> on IBM PCs, PCs could not themselves read Atari disks, because the initial versions of TOS could recognise, read, and write to but not themselves create discs in the same particular specification used and indeed demanded by MS-DOS because of different field usage on the FAT filesystem. Achieving successful data interchange between the two platforms using floppies thus required pre-formatting dedicated file transfer discs under MS-DOS, and copying the necessary data onto them from any unsuitable Atari formatted discs. This formatting issue was soon resolved by the emergence of third-party formatting and file copier software, MS-DOS disc imaging software capable of reading the unusual formats used by the ST and various other machines (such as the Commodore Amiga) and, a few years later, Atari's own version 1.4 (and later) TOS upgrades.

Atari later upgraded the basic design in 1986 with the "1040ST" (also written "STF"). The machine is generally similar to the earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a double-sided <a href="floppy%20drive">floppy drive</a> into the rear of the housing of the computer, as opposed to being external. This added to the size of the machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. The joystick/mouse ports, formerly on the right side of the machine where the disk drive now sat, were moved to a niche underneath the keyboard.

The "1040ST" was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1 MB. When the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it appeared on the cover of "<a href="Byte%20Magazine">BYTE</a>" in March 1986 as the first computer to break the $1000/megabyte price barrier; "<a href="Compute%21">Compute!</a>" noted that, in fact, the "1040ST" was the first computer to break the $2500/megabyte price barrier. However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan. The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model numbers of the "XE series" of the <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a> of computers. A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive.

The same basic design was also used for a cut-down version, the 512 kB "520STFM", which replaced the earlier 520ST models in the market. The early 'STF' machines lack the 'M' modulator that allows a TV to be used and will only work with a monitor.

Initial sales were strong, especially in Europe where Atari sold 75% of its computers. Germany became Atari's strongest market, with small business users using them for desktop publishing and CAD.

To address this growing market segment, Atari came up with the "ST1". Debuted at Comdex in 1986, it was received favorably. Renamed the "Mega", this new machine includes a high-quality detached keyboard, a stronger case to support the weight of a monitor, and an internal bus expansion connector. A 20 MB hard drive called the SH204 could be purchased as an option and stacked below or above the main case of the Mega. The upcoming <a href="SLM804">SLM804</a> <a href="laser%20printer">laser printer</a> would not come with a processor or memory, reducing costs. It would attach to the Mega through the ST DMA port and require the Mega computer to render the pages. As TOS was not a <a href="multitasking">multitasking</a> OS, this meant the computer could not be used while printing. Initially equipped with 2 or 4 MB (a 1 MB version, the "Mega 1" would later follow), the Mega machines would complement the Atari laser printer for a low-cost desktop publishing package, which received acclaim and was featured on the cover of Computer Shopper magazine.

A custom <a href="blitter">blitter</a> co-processor was to be included to speed the performance of some graphics operations on the screen, but due to delays it was eventually released on the "Mega 2" and "Mega 4" machines. Developers wanting to use it had to detect for it in their programs because it was not present on all machines. However, properly written programs using the screen VDI commands can use the blitter seamlessly, since GEM <a href="Application%20programming%20interface">API</a> is a higher-level interface to "TOS".

In late 1989, <a href="Atari">Atari</a> released the 520ST and 1040ST (also written STE), enhanced version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. It features an increased color palette of 4,096 colors from the ST's 512 (though the maximum displayable palette of these without programming tricks was still limited to 16 in the lowest 320x200 resolution, and even fewer in higher resolutions), <a href="Genlock">Genlock</a> support, and a <a href="blitter">blitter</a> co-processor (stylized as "BLiTTER") which can quickly move large blocks of data (most particularly, graphics data) around in RAM. The STE was the first Atari with PCM audio; using a new chip, it added the ability to play back 8-bit (signed) samples at 6258 Hz, 12517 Hz, 25033 Hz and even 50066 Hz. The channels are arranged as either a mono track or a track of LRLRLRLR... bytes. RAM was now much more simply upgradable via <a href="SIMM">SIMM</a>s.

Two enhanced joystick ports were added (two normal joysticks can be plugged into each port with an adapter), with the new connectors placed in more easily accessed locations on the side of the case. The enhanced joystick ports were re-used in Atari's <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Jaguar</a> console and are compatible.

The STE models initially had software and hardware conflicts resulting in some <a href="Application%20software">applications</a> and video games written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable, primarily caused by programming direct hardware calls which bypassed the operating system. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behavior with a few applications (such as the <a href="WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> word-processor application <a href="1st%20Word/1st%20Word%20Plus">1st Word Plus</a>). Very little use was made of the extra features of the STE: STE-enhanced and STE-only software was rare.

The last STE machine, the "<a href="Atari%20MEGA%20STE">Mega STE</a>", is an STE in a grey <a href="Atari%20TT">Atari TT</a> case that had a switchable 16 MHz, dual-bus design (16-bit external, 32-bit internal), optional <a href="Motorola%2068881">Motorola 68881</a> <a href="floating%20point%20unit">FPU</a>, built-in 3½-inch floppy disk drive, <a href="VMEbus">VME</a> expansion slot, a network port (very similar to that used by Apple's <a href="LocalTalk">LocalTalk</a>) and an optional built-in 3½" hard drive. It also shipped with TOS 2.00 (better support for hard drives, enhanced desktop interface, memory test, 1.44 MB floppy support, bug fixes). It was marketed as more affordable than a TT but more powerful than an ordinary ST.

In 1990, Atari released the high-end workstation-oriented "Atari TT030", based on a 32 MHz <a href="Motorola%2068030">Motorola 68030</a> processor. The "TT" name ("Thirty-two/Thirty-two") continued the nomenclature system as the 68030 chip had full 32-bit wide buses both internally and externally. Originally planned with a 68020 CPU, the TT included improved graphics and more powerful support chips. The case was a new design with an integrated hard-drive enclosure.

The final ST computer is the multimedia-capable "Atari Falcon030". Like the TT, this was also 68030-based, operating at 16 MHz, but with improved video modes and an on-board <a href="Motorola%2056000">Motorola 56001</a> audio <a href="digital%20signal%20processor">digital signal processor</a>. The Falcon, like the <a href="Atari%20STE">Atari STE</a>, supports sampling frequencies above 44.1 kHz; the sampling master clock is 98340 Hz, which can be divided by a number between 2 and 16 to get the actual sampling frequencies. Apart from these frequencies, it is also able to play the STE sample frequencies (up to 50066 Hz) in 8 or 16 bit, mono/stereo, all by using the same DMA interface as the STE, with a few additions. The Falcon can both play back and record samples; it has 8 mono channels / 4 stereo channels; thus this allowed musicians to use the computer for harddisk recording. Although the 68030 microprocessor is capable of using 32-bit memory, the Falcon uses a 16-bit bus which affects performance, but also served to reduce its cost. In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the ST and ST. Aftermarket upgrade kits were available that allowed the Falcon to be put in a desktop or rack-mount case, with the keyboard separate.

Released in 1992, the Falcon was discontinued by Atari the following year. In Europe, C-Lab licensed the Falcon design from Atari, and released the C-Lab Falcon Mk I (the same as Atari's Falcon except for some slight modifications to the audio circuitry), Mk II (as Mk I but with an internal 500 MB SCSI hard disk) and Mk X (as Mk II but in a desktop case).

In 1993, Atari ceased development on the ST computers to focus on the <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Jaguar</a>.

Following the exit of Atari from the computer market, Medusa Computer Systems manufactured some powerful 3rd-party Atari Falcon/TT-compatible machines that used <a href="Motorola%2068040">68040</a> and <a href="Motorola%2068060">68060</a> processors, based on multimedia (particularly audio, but also video), CAD, and office uses.

Despite the lack of a hardware supplier, there is a small active community dedicated to keeping the ST platform alive. There have been advancements in the operating system, software emulators (for Windows, Mac, & Linux), and some hardware developments. There are accelerator cards, such as the CT60 & CT63, which is a <a href="68060">68060</a> based accelerator card for the Falcon, and there is the <a href="Atari%20Coldfire%20Project">Atari Coldfire Project</a>, which aims at developing an Atari-clone based on the <a href="Freescale%20ColdFire">Coldfire</a> processor. Milan Computer of <a href="Germany">Germany</a> also made 68040 and 68060-based Atari clones that can run either Atari TOS 4.5 or Milan Computer's <a href="MultiTOS">MultiTOS</a> operating system.

As with the Atari 8-bit computers, software publishers attributed their reluctance to produce Atari ST products in part to—as "<a href="Compute%21">Compute!</a>" reported in 1988—the belief in the existence of a "higher-than-normal amount of software piracy". That year WordPerfect threatened to discontinue the Atari ST version of its word processor because the company discovered that pirate <a href="bulletin%20board%20system">bulletin board system</a>s (BBSs) were distributing it, causing "ST-Log" to warn that "we had better put a stop to piracy "now" ... it can have harmful effects on the longevity and health of your computer". In 1989 magazines published a letter by <a href="Gilman%20Louie">Gilman Louie</a>, head of <a href="Spectrum%20Holobyte">Spectrum Holobyte</a>. He stated that he had been warned by competitors that releasing a game like "<a href="Falcon%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Falcon</a>" on the ST would fail because BBSs would widely disseminate it. Within 30 days of releasing the non-<a href="copy%20protection">copy protected</a> ST version, the game was available on BBSs with maps and <a href="code%20wheel">code wheel</a>s. Because the ST market was smaller than that for the IBM PC it was more vulnerable to piracy which, Louie said, seemed to be better organized and more widely accepted for the ST. He reported that the Amiga version sold in six weeks twice as much as the ST version in nine weeks, and that the Mac and PC versions had four times the sales. "Computer Gaming World" stated "This is certainly the clearest exposition ... we have seen to date" of why software companies produced less software for the ST than for other computers.

The ST has built-in <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> ports, and there was plenty of MIDI-related software for use professionally in music studios, or by amateur enthusiasts. The popular Windows/Macintosh applications "<a href="Cubase">Cubase</a>" and "<a href="Logic%20Pro">Logic Pro</a>" originated on the Atari ST (the latter as "Notator Logic", preceded by "Creator", "Notator" and "Notator-SL"). Another popular and powerful ST music sequencer application, Dr. T's "KCS", contains a "Multi-Program Environment" that allows ST users to run other applications, such as the synthesizer patch editing software XoR (now known as Unisyn on the Macintosh), from within the sequencer application.

Music <a href="Tracker%20%28music%20software%29">tracker</a> software was popular on the ST, such as the "TCB Tracker", aiding the production of quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer ('chiptunes').

An innovative music composition program that combines the sample playing abilities of a tracker with conventional music notation (which was usually only found in MIDI software) is called "Quartet" (after its four-note polyphonic tracker, which displays one monophonic stave at a time on color screens).

Due to the ST having comparatively large amounts of memory for the time, sound sampling packages became a realistic proposition. The Microdeal "<a href="Replay%20Professional">Replay Professional</a>" product features a sound sampler that cleverly uses the ST cartridge port to read in parallel from the cartridge port from the <a href="Analog-to-digital%20converter">ADC</a>. For output of digital sound, it uses the on-board frequency output, sets it to 128 kHz (inaudible) and then modulates the amplitude of that.

Another program that had success on the ST platform is "<a href="MasterTracks%20Pro%20%28software%29">MasterTracks Pro</a>" from Passport Designs, of Half Moon Bay, CA., that was first put out by Don Williams for the Macintosh. When the ST died, a PC version continued that one could port MIDI to using the generic .MID format. <a href="GVOX">GVox</a> bought out Passport, and continues the program for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> and <a href="macOS">macOS</a> along with the other Passport product, the notation program "<a href="Encore%20%28software%29">Encore</a>".

Also popular on the ST was professional <a href="desktop%20publishing">desktop publishing</a> software, such as "<a href="PageStream">PageStream</a>" and "<a href="Calamus%20%28DTP%29">Calamus</a>"; office tools such as word processors ("<a href="WordPerfect">WordPerfect</a>", "<a href="Microsoft%20Write">Microsoft Write</a>", "<a href="AtariWorks">AtariWorks</a>", "<a href="WordWriter%20ST">WordWriter ST</a>", First Word and its Plus continuation, and others); spreadsheets ("<a href="3D-Calc">3D-Calc</a>", "<a href="LDW%20Power">LDW Power</a>", "<a href="LDW%20Power%202">LDW Power 2</a>", "<a href="LOGiSTiX%20Senior">LOGiSTiX Senior</a>", "<a href="PowerLedger%20ST">PowerLedger ST</a>", "<a href="SwiftCalc%20ST">SwiftCalc ST</a>", "<a href="VIP%20Professional">VIP Professional</a>", and others); turnkey programs ("<a href="Mail-Pro">Mail-Pro</a>", "<a href="Sales-Pro%206">Sales-Pro 6</a>", "<a href="Video-Pro">Video-Pro</a>", and others); database programs ("<a href="A-Calc%20Prime">A-Calc Prime</a>", "<a href="Data%20Manager">Data Manager</a>", "<a href="Data%20Manager%20Professional">Data Manager Professional</a>", "<a href="DBMan%20V">DBMan V</a>", "<a href="Base%20Two">Base Two</a>", "<a href="H%26amp%3BDBase">H&DBase</a>", "<a href="Informer%20II">Informer II</a>", "<a href="DB%20Master%20One">DB Master One</a>", "<a href="SBT%20Database%20Accounting%20Library">SBT Database Accounting Library</a>" ("<a href="dLedger">dLedger</a>", "<a href="dInvoice">dInvoice</a>", "<a href="dOrder">dOrder</a>", "<a href="dPurchases">dPurchases</a>", and "<a href="dPayables">dPayables</a>)", "<a href="Superbase%20Personal">Superbase Personal</a>", "<a href="Superbase%20Professional">Superbase Professional</a>", "<a href="Tracker%20ST">Tracker ST</a>", and others); and various CAD and CAM tools from amateur hobbyist to professional grade (Campus CAD, DynaCADD, Leonard ST, Technobox CAD/2...): all being largely targeted at, or even limited to owners of high-resolution monochrome monitors.

Graphics programs such as "<a href="NEOchrome">NEOchrome</a>", <a href="DEGAS%20%28software%29">Degas & Degas Elite</a>, "Canvas", "<a href="Deluxe%20Paint">Deluxe Paint</a>", and "<a href="Cyber%20Paint">Cyber Paint</a>" (which author <a href="Jim%20Kent">Jim Kent</a> would later evolve into "<a href="Autodesk%20Animator">Autodesk Animator</a>") featured advanced features such as 3D design and animation. One paint program, "<a href="Spectrum%20512">Spectrum 512</a>", uses the ST's rapid palette switching ability to expand the maximum number of colors to be displayed on-screen at once to 512 (up to 46 in each scan line the STE never had a Spectrum4096, but other more minor applications filled this speciality niche, one even going so far as to program the shifter chip to palette shift at a rate enabling a display of 19200 colors).

<a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D computer graphics</a> applications (like "<a href="Cyber%20Studio">Cyber Studio</a>"s "CAD-3D", which author Tom Hudson would later develop into <a href="Autodesk">Autodesk</a> "<a href="3ds%20Max">3D Studio</a>"), brought 3D modelling, sculpting, scripting, and most important, <a href="computer%20animation">computer animation</a> (using <a href="Delta%20encoding">delta-compression</a>) to the desktop. Video-capture and -editing applications using special video-capture 'dongles' connected using the cartridge port low frame rate, mainly silent and monochrome, but progressing to sound and basic color (in still frames) by the end of the machine's life. At the end, Spectrum 512 and CAD-3D teamed up to produce realistic 512-color textured 3D renderings, but processing was slow, and Atari's failure to deliver a machine with a math coprocessor had Hudson and Yost looking towards the PC as the future before a finished product could be delivered to the consumer.

The Atari ST was the computer upon which today's prevalent graphical touchscreen point of sale software for restaurants was originally developed. This software was created by <a href="Gene%20Mosher">Gene Mosher</a> under the <a href="ViewTouch">ViewTouch</a> copyright and trademark. It does not feature the Atari ST's GEM graphical user interface but, instead, features an application specific graphical user interface and widget framework which he developed using, in part, the <a href="Neochrome">Neochrome</a> paint program.

The Atari ST has a wide variety of languages and tools for development. 68000 assemblers (MadMac from Atari Corp, <a href="HiSoft%20Systems">HiSoft Systems</a>'s Devpac, TurboAss, GFA-Assembler), Pascal (<a href="OSS%20Personal%20Pascal">OSS Personal Pascal</a>, Maxon Pascal, PurePascal), <a href="Modula-2">Modula-2</a>, C compilers (like <a href="Turbo%20C">Turbo C</a>, Alcyon C, <a href="Lattice%20C">Lattice C</a>, <a href="Megamax%20C">Megamax C</a>, <a href="Mark%20Williams%20C">Mark Williams C</a>, <a href="GNU%20Compiler%20Collection">GNU C</a>, Aztec C, AHCC), <a href="LISP">LISP</a>, <a href="Prolog">Prolog</a>, <a href="Logo%20programming%20language">Logo</a>, and others.

The initial development kit from Atari included a computer and manuals. At $5,000, this discouraged many from developing software for the ST. Later, the Atari Developer's Kit consisted of software and manuals (no hardware) for $300. Included with the kit were a resource kit, C compiler (first Alcyon C, then Mark Williams C), debugger, and 68000 assembler (plus the non-disclosure agreement).

The ST came bundled with a system disk that contained <a href="ST%20BASIC">ST BASIC</a>, the first BASIC for the ST. However, due to its poor performance, users favored other BASICs, such as HiSoft BASIC, <a href="GFA%20BASIC">GFA BASIC</a>, FaST BASIC (notable for being one of the few programs to be supplied as a ROM cartridge), <a href="DTACK%20Grounded">DBASIC</a>, and "<a href="STOS%20BASIC%20programming%20language">STOS</a>", which then inspired and led to the creation of AMOS on the Amiga, and was powerful enough that it was used (with a compiler, opposed to its usual runtime interpreter) for the production of at least two commercial titles and a host of good quality shareware and public domain games. In the late years of the Atari ST Omikron Basic was bundled with it in Germany.

The ST enjoyed success in gaming due to the low cost, fast performance, and colorful graphics.

Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include <a href="Peter%20Molyneux">Peter Molyneux</a>, <a href="Doug%20Bell">Doug Bell</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Minter">Jeff Minter</a>, <a href="%C3%89ric%20Chahi">Éric Chahi</a>, <a href="Jez%20San">Jez San</a>, and <a href="David%20Braben">David Braben</a>. An early real-time 3D <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>, "<a href="Dungeon%20Master%20%28video%20game%29">Dungeon Master</a>", was first developed and released on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform. Simulation games like "<a href="Falcon%20%28video%20game%29">Falcon</a>" and "<a href="Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator%23History">Flight Simulator II</a>" made use of the enhanced graphics found in the ST machines, as did many arcade ports. One game, "<a href="MIDI%20Maze">MIDI Maze</a>", uses the <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> ports to connect up to 16 machines for interactive networked play. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that had identical graphics and sound were often accused by video game magazines of simply being ST ports. The critically acclaimed game "<a href="Another%20World%20%28video%20game%29">Another World</a>" was originally released for ST and Amiga in 1991 with the Polygonal engine developed on the ST and the rotoscoped animations created on the Amiga (the two games are very similar on both systems).

<a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> became the first player to register the commercial "<a href="ChessBase">ChessBase</a>", a popular commercial database program produced for storing and searching records of games of chess. The first version was built for Atari ST with his collaboration in January 1987. In his autobiography "Child of Change", he regards this facility as "the most important development in chess research since printing".

Utility software was available to drive hardware add-ons such as video digitisers. Office Productivity and graphics software was also bundled with the ST (<a href="HyperPaint%20II">HyperPaint II</a> by <a href="Dimitri%20Koveos">Dimitri Koveos</a>, <a href="HyperDraw">HyperDraw</a> by <a href="David%20Farmborough">David Farmborough</a>, <a href="3D-Calc">3D-Calc</a> spreadsheet by <a href="Frank%20Schoonjans">Frank Schoonjans</a>, and several others commissioned by Bob Katz, later of <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>).

There was a thriving output of <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a> and <a href="shareware">shareware</a> software which was distributed by, in the days long before public internet access, <a href="public%20domain%20software%20library">public domain software libraries</a> that advertised in magazines and on popular dial-up <a href="bulletin%20board%20system">bulletin board system</a>s.

Remarkably, a modest core fanbase for the system, supporting a dwindling number of good quality print magazines, survived to the mid-'90s and the birth of the modern, publicly accessible Internet as we know it. Despite the limited graphics, memory, and temporary hard-storage capabilities of the system, several email, FTP, telnet, IRC, and even full-blown graphical World Wide Web browser applications were available and usable on the ST.

There were also DOS emulators released in the late 1980s. "PC-Ditto" came in two versions, software-only-, and a hardware version that plugs into the cartridge slot or kludges internally. After running the PC-Ditto software, a DOS boot disk is required to load the system. Both allow users to run DOS programs in <a href="Color%20Graphics%20Adapter">CGA</a> mode, though much more slowly than on an <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>. Other options are the "PC-Speed" (<a href="NEC%20V30">NEC V30</a>), "AT-Speed" (<a href="Intel%2080286">Intel 80286</a>) and "ATonce-386SX" (<a href="80386SX">Intel 80386sx</a>) hardware emulator boards.

The ST's low cost, built-in MIDI ports, and fast, low-latency response times made it a favorite with musicians:


All STs are made up of both custom and commercial chips:


As originally released in the "520ST":


Very early machines included the OS on a floppy disk due to it not being ready to be burned to ROM (like the <a href="Amiga%201000">Amiga 1000</a> had). This early version of TOS was bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM, but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a> versions of TOS 1.0 when it was ready. (This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 kB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 kB code into RAM when booting the desktop). Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS. Soon after this change, most production models became STs, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 kB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 kB RAM) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS: 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an <a href="RF%20Modulator">RF Modulator</a> that allows the machine to be hooked to a color TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50 Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the "520ST" (or "520STM"). Later "F" and "FM" models of the 520 had a built in <a href="double-sided%20disk">double-sided disk</a> drive instead of a single-sided one.

As originally released in the "520ST/1040ST":


The members of the ST family are listed below, in rough chronological order:

Aaliyah

Aaliyah Dana Haughton (; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, and model. She was born in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, and raised in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, Michigan. At the age of 10, she appeared on the television show "<a href="Star%20Search">Star Search</a>" and performed in concert alongside <a href="Gladys%20Knight">Gladys Knight</a>. At age 12, Aaliyah signed with <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive Records</a> and her uncle <a href="Barry%20Hankerson">Barry Hankerson</a>'s <a href="Blackground%20Records">Blackground Records</a>. Hankerson introduced her to <a href="R.%20Kelly">R. Kelly</a>, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, "<a href="Age%20Ain%27t%20Nothing%20but%20a%20Number">Age Ain't Nothing but a Number</a>". The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with R. Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a>.

Aaliyah worked with record producers <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a> and <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a> for her second album, "<a href="One%20in%20a%20Million%20%28Aaliyah%20album%29">One in a Million</a>", which sold 3 million copies in the United States and over eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, "<a href="Romeo%20Must%20Die">Romeo Must Die</a>". She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single "<a href="Try%20Again%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Try Again</a>". The song topped the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> solely on <a href="airplay">airplay</a>, making Aaliyah the first artist in "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" history to achieve this goal. "Try Again" earned Aaliyah a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. After completing "Romeo Must Die", Aaliyah filmed her role in "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Damned">Queen of the Damned</a>". She released her third and final album, "<a href="Aaliyah%20%28album%29">Aaliyah</a>", in July 2001.

On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in a plane crash in <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a> after filming the music video for the single "<a href="Rock%20the%20Boat%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Rock the Boat</a>". The pilot, Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and <a href="toxicology">toxicology</a> tests revealed that he had traces of <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> and alcohol in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a <a href="wrongful%20death">wrongful death</a> lawsuit against <a href="Blackhawk%20International%20Airways">Blackhawk International Airways</a>, which was settled out of court. Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases. Aaliyah has sold an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. She has been credited for helping redefine <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">contemporary R&B</a>, <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, earning her the <a href="Honorific%20nicknames%20in%20popular%20music">nicknames</a> "Princess of R&B" and "Queen of Urban Pop". She is listed by "Billboard" as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years and 27th most successful R&B artist in history.

Aaliyah Dana Haughton was born on January 16, 1979, in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York, and was the younger child of Diane and Michael "Miguel" Haughton (1951–2012). She was <a href="African%20American">African American</a>, and had Native American (<a href="Oneida%20people">Oneida</a>) heritage from a grandmother. Her name has been described as a female version of the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> "Ali"; however, the original Arabic and Jewish name "<a href="Aliya%20%28disambiguation%29">Aliya</a> (Hebrew: אליה)" derived from the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> word "<a href="Aliyah%20%28Torah%29">aliyah</a> (Hebrew: עלייה)", and meant "highest, most exalted one, the best." Regardless of origin, the singer was highly fond of her Semitic name, expressing support by calling it "beautiful" and asserting that she was "very proud of it," and she thus spent her entire life striving to live up to her name every day. At a young age, Aaliyah was enrolled in voice lessons by her mother. She started performing at weddings, church <a href="choir">choir</a> and charity events. When she was five years old, her family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she was raised along with her older brother, <a href="Rashad%20Haughton">Rashad</a>. She attended a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> school, Gesu Elementary, where in <a href="first%20grade">first grade</a>, she received a part in the stage play "<a href="Annie%20%28musical%29">Annie</a>". From then on, she was determined to become an entertainer. In Detroit, her father began working in the warehouse business, one of his brother-in-law <a href="Barry%20Hankerson">Barry Hankerson</a>'s widening interests. Her mother stayed home and raised Aaliyah and her brother.

Throughout her life, she had a good relationship with her brother, which traced back to their childhood as Rashad reflected that growing up with Aaliyah was "amazing". He recalled her running around their home singing and that never being annoying due to her having a "beautiful voice". She and her brother became close with their cousin Jomo Hankerson, since growing up, they lived "about five blocks apart". Jomo walked Aaliyah and Rashad to their home from school when their mother was not able to pick them up and recalled the Haughton household being filled with music. Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when the Haughtons moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.

Aaliyah's mother was a vocalist, and her uncle, <a href="Barry%20Hankerson">Barry Hankerson</a>, was an <a href="entertainment%20law">entertainment law</a>yer who had been married to <a href="Gladys%20Knight">Gladys Knight</a>. As a child, Aaliyah traveled with Knight and worked with an agent in New York to audition for commercials and television programs, including "<a href="Family%20Matters">Family Matters</a>"; she went on to appear on "<a href="Star%20Search">Star Search</a>" at the age of ten. Aaliyah chose to begin auditioning while her mother made the decision to have her surname dropped. She auditioned for several record labels and at age 11 appeared in concerts alongside Knight. She had several pet animals in during her childhood, which included ducks, snakes and iguanas. Her cousin Jomo had a pet alligator, which Aaliyah felt was too much, remarking, "that was something I wasn't going to stroke."

Her grandmother died in 1991. Years after her death, Aaliyah said her grandmother supported everyone in the family and always wanted to hear her sing, as well as admitting that she "spoiled" her and her brother Rashad "to death." She also enjoyed Aaliyah's singing and would have Aaliyah to sing for her. Aaliyah stated that she thought of her grandmother whenever she fell into depression. Aaliyah's hands reminded her of her aunt, who died when she was "very young" and Aaliyah referred to her as an "amazingly beautiful woman".

When she was growing up, Aaliyah attended Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, but she did not stay focused on them. "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had "learned to accept and love" herself and added: "... the most important thing is to think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".

During her audition for acceptance to the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts Aaliyah sung the song "<a href="Ave%20Maria%20%28Schubert%29">Ave Maria</a>" in its entirety in the <a href="Italian%20language">Italian language</a>.

Aaliyah, who maintained a perfect 4.0 grade point average when graduating from Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important to have something to fall back on." She did this in her own life, as she planned to "fall back on" another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that if she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, "when you pick a career it has to be something you love".

After Hankerson signed a distribution deal with <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive Records</a>, he signed Aaliyah to his <a href="Blackground%20Records">Blackground Records</a> label at the age of 12. Hankerson later introduced her to recording artist and producer <a href="R.%20Kelly">R. Kelly</a>, who became Aaliyah's mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her first album, which was recorded when she was 14. Aaliyah's debut album, "<a href="Age%20Ain%27t%20Nothing%20but%20a%20Number">Age Ain't Nothing but a Number</a>", was released under her mononym "Aaliyah", by <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive</a> and <a href="Blackground%20Records">Blackground Records</a> on May 24, 1994; the album debut at number 24 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, selling 74,000 copies in its first week. It ultimately peaked at number 18 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> and sold over three million copies in the United States, where it was certified two times <a href="music%20recording%20sales%20certification">Platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a>. In Canada, the album sold over 50,000 copies and was certified gold by the <a href="Canadian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">CRIA</a>. Aaliyah's debut single, "<a href="Back%20%26amp%3B%20Forth%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Back & Forth</a>", topped the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> chart for three weeks and was certified <a href="music%20recording%20sales%20certification">Gold</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a>. The second single, a <a href="cover%20version">cover</a> of <a href="The%20Isley%20Brothers">The Isley Brothers</a>' "<a href="At%20Your%20Best%20%28You%20Are%20Love%29">At Your Best (You Are Love)</a>", peaked at number six on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and was also certified Gold by the RIAA. The title track, "<a href="Age%20Ain%27t%20Nothing%20but%20a%20Number%20%28song%29">Age Ain't Nothing but a Number</a>", peaked at number 75 on the Hot 100. Additionally, she released "<a href="The%20Thing%20I%20Like">The Thing I Like</a>" as part of the soundtrack to the 1994 film "<a href="A%20Low%20Down%20Dirty%20Shame">A Low Down Dirty Shame</a>".

"Age Ain't Nothing But a Number" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Some writers noted that Aaliyah's "silky vocals" and "sultry voice" blended with Kelly's <a href="new%20jack%20swing">new jack swing</a> helped define <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> in the 1990s. Her sound was also compared to that of female quartet <a href="En%20Vogue">En Vogue</a>. Christopher John Farley of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine described the album as a "beautifully restrained work", noting that Aaliyah's "girlish, breathy vocals rode calmly on R. Kelly's rough beats". <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> felt that the album had its "share of filler", but described the singles as "slyly seductive". He also claimed that the songs on the album were "frequently better" than that of Kelly's second studio album, "<a href="12%20Play">12 Play</a>". The single "At Your Best (You Are Love)" was criticized by "Billboard" for being out of place on the album and for its length.

In 1996, Aaliyah left <a href="Jive%20Records">Jive Records</a> and signed with <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a>. She worked with record producers <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a> and <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a>, who contributed to her second studio album, "<a href="One%20in%20a%20Million%20%28Aaliyah%20album%29">One in a Million</a>". Missy Elliott recalled Timbaland and herself being nervous to work with Aaliyah, since Aaliyah had already released her successful début album while Missy Elliott and Timbaland were just starting out. Missy Elliott also feared she would be a diva, but reflected that Aaliyah "came in and was so warming; she made us immediately feel like family."
The album yielded the single "<a href="If%20Your%20Girl%20Only%20Knew">If Your Girl Only Knew</a>", which topped the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> for two weeks. It also generated the singles "<a href="Hot%20Like%20Fire">Hot Like Fire</a>" and "<a href="4%20Page%20Letter">4 Page Letter</a>". The following year, Aaliyah was featured on <a href="Timbaland%20%26amp%3B%20Magoo">Timbaland & Magoo</a>'s debut single, "<a href="Up%20Jumps%20da%20Boogie">Up Jumps da Boogie</a>". "One in a Million" peaked at number 18 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, selling 3 million copies in the United States and over eight million copies worldwide.
The album was certified <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">double platinum</a> by the RIAA on June 16, 1997, denoting shipments of two million copies. The month prior to "One in a Million"s release, on May 5, 1997, music publisher Windswept Pacific filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Aaliyah claiming she had illegally copied <a href="Bobby%20Caldwell">Bobby Caldwell</a>'s "<a href="What%20You%20Won%27t%20Do%20for%20Love%20%28song%29">What You Won't Do for Love</a>" for the single "<a href="Age%20Ain%27t%20Nothing%20but%20a%20Number%20%28song%29">Age Ain't Nothing but a Number</a>".

Aaliyah attended the <a href="Detroit%20School%20of%20Arts">Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts</a>, where she majored in drama and graduated in 1997 with a 4.0 GPA. Aaliyah began her acting career that same year; she played herself in the <a href="police%20procedural">police drama</a> television series "<a href="New%20York%20Undercover">New York Undercover</a>". During this time, Aaliyah participated in the Children's Benefit Concert, a <a href="benefit%20concert">charity concert</a> that took place at the <a href="Beacon%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Beacon Theatre</a> in New York. Aaliyah also became the spokesperson for <a href="Tommy%20Hilfiger%20Corporation">Tommy Hilfiger Corporation</a>. In 1997 Aaliyah performed the Christmas carol <a href="What%20Child%20Is%20This%3F">What Child Is This</a> at the annual holiday special <a href="Christmas%20in%20Washington">Christmas in Washington</a>. She contributed on the soundtrack album for the <a href="Fox%20Animation%20Studios">Fox Animation Studios</a> animated feature "<a href="Anastasia%20%281997%20film%29">Anastasia</a>", performing a <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> of "<a href="Journey%20to%20the%20Past">Journey to the Past</a>" which earned songwriters <a href="Lynn%20Ahrens">Lynn Ahrens</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Flaherty">Stephen Flaherty</a> a nomination for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song">Academy Award for Best Original Song</a>. Aaliyah performed the song at the <a href="70th%20Academy%20Awards">1998 Academy Awards ceremony</a> and became the youngest singer to perform at the event. The song "<a href="Are%20You%20That%20Somebody%3F">Are You That Somebody?</a>" was featured on the "<a href="Dr.%20Dolittle%20%28film%29">Dr. Dolittle</a>" <a href="Dr.%20Dolittle%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack</a>, which earned Aaliyah her first <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nomination. The song peaked at number 21 on the Hot 100.

In 1999, Aaliyah landed her first film role in "<a href="Romeo%20Must%20Die">Romeo Must Die</a>", released March 22, 2000. Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist <a href="Jet%20Li">Jet Li</a>, playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to "make it easier on" herself, but she heard "that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted." In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", who wrote that while Aaliyah was "a natural" and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, "they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Her role was well received by Glen Oliver by <a href="IGN">IGN</a> who liked that she did not portray her character "as a victimized female" but instead "as a strong female who does not come across as an over-the-top Women's Right Advocate."

In addition to acting, Aaliyah served as an executive producer of the <a href="Romeo%20Must%20Die%20%28soundtrack%29">film's soundtrack</a>, where she contributed four songs. "<a href="Try%20Again%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Try Again</a>" was released as a single from the soundtrack; the song topped the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, making Aaliyah the first artist to top the chart based solely on <a href="airplay">airplay</a>; this led the song to be released in a <a href="12-inch%20single">12" vinyl</a> and <a href="gramophone%20record">7" single</a>. The music video won the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Video">Best Female Video</a> and <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Video%20from%20a%20Film">Best Video from a Film</a> awards at the <a href="2000%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2000 MTV Video Music Awards</a>. It also earned her a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. The soundtrack went on to sell 1.5 million copies in the United States.

After completing "<a href="Romeo%20Must%20Die">Romeo Must Die</a>", Aaliyah began to work on her second film, "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Damned">Queen of the Damned</a>". She played the role of an ancient <a href="vampire">vampire</a>, Queen Akasha, which she described as a "manipulative, crazy, sexual being". Prior to her death, she expressed the possibility of recording songs for the film's soundtrack and welcomed the possibility of collaborating with <a href="Jonathan%20Davis">Jonathan Davis</a>. She was scheduled to film for the sequels of "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>" as the character <a href="Zee%20%28The%20Matrix%29">Zee</a>.

In May 2001, <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> admitted that his remarks where he claimed to have engaged in sexual intercourse with Aaliyah, <a href="Cindy%20Crawford">Cindy Crawford</a> and <a href="Venus%20Williams">Venus Williams</a> were false after making the allegations during an appearance on a radio station and apologized to the three. All three denied the claims. The following month, June 2001, Aaliyah posed for a photo shoot with Eric Johnson. Johnson kept the images in his "private personal archive" for thirteen years before providing digital copies of 13 Aaliyah photographs to an online photography magazine and authorizing the publication to use the photographs for a story they were doing on Aaliyah. Not long after, he filed a lawsuit claiming ABC had infringed his rights since the corporation authorized further reproduction by reproducing them online.

Aaliyah released her self-titled album, "<a href="Aaliyah%20%28album%29">Aaliyah</a>", in July 2001. It debuted at number two on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, selling 187,000 copies in its first week. The first single from the album, "<a href="We%20Need%20a%20Resolution">We Need a Resolution</a>", peaked at number 59 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>. She finished recording the album in March 2001 after a year of recording tracks that began in March of the previous year. At the time she started recording the album, Aaliyah's publicist disclosed the album's release date as most likely being in October 2000.
Filming for "Queen of the Damned" delayed the release of "Aaliyah". Aaliyah enjoyed balancing her singing and acting careers. Though she called music a "first" for her, she also had been acting since she was young and had wanted to begin acting "at some point in my career," but "wanted it to be the right time and the right vehicle" and felt "Romeo Must Die" "was it".

"Aaliyah" was released five years after "One in a Million". Aaliyah had not intended for the albums to have such a gap between them. "I wanted to take a break after "One in a Million" to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, "Romeo" happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated." Connie Johnson of the "Los Angeles Times" argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album "the attention it merited." Collaborator Timbaland concurred, stating that he was briefly in Australia to work on the album while Aaliyah was filming and did not feel the same production had gone into "Aaliyah" as "One in a Million" had. He also said Virgin Records had rushed the album and Aaliyah had specifically requested Missy Elliott and Timbaland work on "Aaliyah" with her.

The week after Aaliyah's death, her third studio album, "<a href="Aaliyah%20%28album%29">Aaliyah</a>", rose from number 19 to number one on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. "<a href="Rock%20the%20Boat%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Rock the Boat</a>" was released as a posthumous single. The music video premiered on <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">BET's</a> "<a href="Access%20Granted">Access Granted</a>"; it became the most viewed and highest rated episode in the history of the show. The song peaked at number 14 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and number two on the "Billboard" <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> chart. It was also included on the "<a href="Now%20That%27s%20What%20I%20Call%20Music%21%208%20%28U.S.%20series%29">Now That's What I Call Music! 8</a>" compilation series; a portion of the album's profits was donated to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund. Promotional posters for "Aaliyah" that had been put up in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles became makeshift memorials for grieving fans.

"<a href="More%20than%20a%20Woman%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">More than a Woman</a>" and "<a href="I%20Care%204%20U%20%28song%29">I Care 4 U</a>" were released as posthumous singles and peaked within the top 25 of the "Billboard" Hot 100. The album was certified double <a href="music%20recording%20sales%20certification">Platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a> and sold 2.6 million copies in the United States. "More than a Woman" reached number one on the UK singles chart making Aaliyah the first female deceased artist to reach number one on the UK singles chart. "More than a Woman" was replaced by <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>'s "<a href="My%20Sweet%20Lord">My Sweet Lord</a>" which is the only time in the UK singles chart's history where a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one. In July 2001, she allowed MTV's show "<a href="Diary%20%28TV%20series%29">Diary</a>" behind-the-scenes access to her life and stated "I am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that I love; there is nothing better than that." She continued, "Everything is worth it – the hard work, the times when you're tired, the times when you are a bit sad. In the end, it's all worth it because it really makes me happy. I wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world. I've got good friends, a beautiful family and I've got a career. I thank God for his blessings every single chance I get."

Aaliyah was signed to appear in several future films, including "<a href="Honey%20%282003%20film%29">Honey</a>", a romantic film titled "Some Kind of Blue", and a <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>-produced remake of the 1976 film "<a href="Sparkle%20%281976%20film%29">Sparkle</a>". Whitney Houston recalled Aaliyah being "so enthusiastic" about the film and wanting to appear in the film "so badly". Houston also voiced her belief that Aaliyah was more than qualified for the role and the film was shelved after she died, since Aaliyah had "gone to a better place". Studio officials of Warner Brothers stated that Aaliyah and her mother had both read the script for "Sparkle". According to them, Aaliyah was passionate about playing the lead role of a young singer in a girl group.
The <a href="Sparkle%20%282012%20film%29">film</a> was released in 2012, eleven years after Aaliyah's death. Before her death, Aaliyah had filmed part of her role in "<a href="The%20Matrix%20Reloaded">The Matrix Reloaded</a>" and was scheduled to appear in "<a href="The%20Matrix%20Revolutions">The Matrix Revolutions</a>" as <a href="Zee%20%28The%20Matrix%29">Zee</a>. Aaliyah told "Access Hollywood" that she was "beyond happy" to have landed the role.
The role was subsequently recast to <a href="Nona%20Gaye">Nona Gaye</a>. Aaliyah's scenes were included in the tribute section of the "Matrix Ultimate Collection" series.

In November 2001, <a href="Ronald%20Isley">Ronald Isley</a> stated that Aaliyah and the <a href="Isley%20Brothers">Isley Brothers</a> had discussed a collaboration prior to her death. She had previously covered the Isley Brothers' single "<a href="At%20Your%20Best%20%28You%20Are%20Love%29">At Your Best (You Are Love)</a>". By 2001, Aaliyah had enjoyed her now seven-year career and felt a sense of accomplishment. "This is what I always wanted," she said of her career in "Vibe" magazine. "I breathe to perform, to entertain, I can't imagine myself doing anything else. I'm just a really happy girl right now. I honestly love every aspect of this business. I really do. I feel very fulfilled and complete."

Aaliyah had the <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a> of a <a href="soprano">soprano</a>. With the release of her debut single "<a href="Back%20%26amp%3B%20Forth%20%28song%29">Back & Forth</a>", Dimitri Ehrlich of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" expressed that Aaliyah's "silky vocals are more agile than those of self-proclaimed queen of hip-hop soul <a href="Mary%20J.%20Blige">Mary J. Blige</a>." In her review for Aaliyah's second studio album "One in a Million" "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" magazine, music critic <a href="Dream%20Hampton">Dream Hampton</a> said that Aaliyah's "deliciously feline" voice has the same "pop appeal" as <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>'s. Aaliyah described her sound as "street but sweet", which featured her "gentle" vocals over a "hard" <a href="beat%20%28music%29">beat</a>. Though Aaliyah did not write any of her own material, her lyrics were described as in-depth. She incorporated <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>, <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> into her music. Her songs were often uptempo and at the same time often dark, revolving around "matters of the heart". After her R. Kelly-produced debut album, Aaliyah worked with Timbaland and Missy Elliott, whose productions were more <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a>. <a href="Sasha%20Frere-Jones">Sasha Frere-Jones</a> of "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">The Wire</a>" finds Aaliyah's "<a href="Are%20You%20That%20Somebody%3F">Are You That Somebody?</a>" to be Timbaland's "masterpiece" and exemplary of his production's start-stop rhythms, with "big half-second pauses between beats and voices". Keith Harris of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" cites "Are You That Somebody?" as "one of '90s R&B's most astounding moments".

Aaliyah's songs have been said to have "crisp production" and "<a href="staccato">staccato</a> arrangements" that "extend genre boundaries" while containing "old-school" <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>. Kelefah Sanneh of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called Aaliyah "a digital diva who wove a spell with ones and zeroes", and writes that her songs comprised "simple vocal riffs, repeated and refracted to echo the manipulated loops that create digital rhythm", as Timbaland's "computer-programmed beats fitted perfectly with her cool, breathy voice to create a new kind of electronic music." When she experimented with other genres on "Aaliyah", such as <a href="Latin%20pop">Latin pop</a> and <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>, "Entertainment Weekly"s <a href="Craig%20Seymour">Craig Seymour</a> panned the attempt. While Analyzing her eponymous album British publication <a href="NME">NME</a> (New Musical Express) felt that Aaliyah's radical third album was intended to consolidate her position as U.S.<a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>'s most experimental artist. As her albums progressed, writers felt that Aaliyah matured, calling her progress a "declaration of strength and independence". <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a> noted that Aaliyah's music was evolving from the punchy pop influenced Hip hop and R&B to a more mature, introspective sound on her third album. <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> described her eponymous album, "<a href="Aaliyah%20%28album%29">Aaliyah</a>", as "a statement of maturity and a stunning artistic leap forward" and called it one of the strongest urban soul records of its time. She portrayed "unfamiliar sounds, styles and emotions", but managed to please critics with the contemporary sound it contained. Ernest Hardy of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" felt that Aaliyah reflected a stronger technique, where she gave her best vocal performance. Prior to her death, Aaliyah expressed a desire to learn about the burgeoning <a href="UK%20garage">UK garage</a> scene she had heard about at the time.

As an artist, Aaliyah often voiced that she was inspired by a number of performers. These include <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href="Sade%20%28singer%29">Sade</a>, <a href="En%20Vogue">En Vogue</a>, <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, <a href="Korn">Korn</a>, <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>, <a href="Naughty%20by%20Nature">Naughty by Nature</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Mathis">Johnny Mathis</a>, <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a> and <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a>. Aaliyah expressed that Michael Jackson's "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>" was her "favorite album" and that "nothing will ever top "Thriller"." She stated that she admired Sade because "she stays true to her style no matter what ... she's an amazing artist, an amazing performer ... and I absolutely love her." Aaliyah expressed she had always desired to work with Janet Jackson, whom she had drawn frequent comparison to over the course of her career, stating "I admire her a great deal. She's a total performer ... I'd love to do a duet with Janet Jackson." Jackson reciprocated Aaliyah's affections, commenting "I've loved her from the beginning because she always comes out and does something different, musically." Jackson also stated she would have enjoyed collaborating with Aaliyah.

Aaliyah focused on her public image throughout her career. She often wore baggy clothes and sunglasses, stating that she wanted to be herself. She described her image as being "important ... to differentiate yourself from the rest of the pack". She often wore black clothing, starting a trend for similar fashion among women in United States and Japan. Aaliyah's fashionable style has been credited for being an influence on new fashion trend's called "Health Goth" and "Ghetto Goth" also known as GHE20 GOTH1K Aaliyah participated in fashion designer <a href="Tommy%20Hilfiger">Tommy Hilfiger</a>'s All America Tour and was featured in Tommy Jean ads, which depicted her in <a href="boxer%20shorts">boxer shorts</a>, baggy jeans and a <a href="tube%20top">tube top</a>. Hilfiger's brother, <a href="Andy%20Hilfiger">Andy</a>, called it "a whole new look" that was "classy but sexy". <a href="Carson%20Daly">Carson Daly</a> A former <a href="VJ%20%28media%20personality%29">VJ</a> on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s <a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a> commented on Aaliyah's style by saying that she was "cutting edge" ,"always one step ahead of the curve" and that "the TRL audience looks to her to figure out what's hot and what's new".

When she changed her hairstyle, Aaliyah took her mother's advice to cover her left eye, much like <a href="Veronica%20Lake">Veronica Lake</a>. The look has become known as her signature and been referred to as fusion of "unnerving emotional honesty" and "a sense of mystique". In 1998, she hired a <a href="personal%20trainer">personal trainer</a> to keep in shape, and exercised five days a week and ate <a href="diet%20food">diet food</a>s. Aaliyah was praised for her "clean-cut image" and "moral values". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" wrote of Aaliyah's artistry and image, "she was lithe and dulcet in a way that signified neither jailbait nor hottie—an <a href="Ingenue%20%28stock%20character%29">ingenue</a> whose selling point was sincerity, not innocence and the obverse it implies."

Aaliyah was viewed by others as a role model. Emil Wilbekin, described by <a href="CNN">CNN</a> as "a friend of Aaliyah's" and follower of her career, explained: "Aaliyah is an excellent role model, because she started her career in the public eye at age 15 with a gold album entitled "<a href="Age%20Ain%27t%20Nothing%20but%20a%20Number">Age Ain't Nothing but a Number</a>". And then her second album, "<a href="One%20in%20a%20Million%20%28Aaliyah%20album%29">One in a Million</a>" went double platinum. She had the leading role in "<a href="Romeo%20Must%20Die">Romeo Must Die</a>", which was a box office success. She's won numerous awards, several MTV music video awards, and aside from her professional successes, many of her lyrics are very inspirational and uplifting. She also carried herself in a very professional manner. She was well spoken. She was beautiful, but she didn't use her beauty to sell her music. She used her talent. Many young hip-hop fans greatly admire her."

She also was seen by others as a <a href="sex%20symbol">sex symbol</a>. Aaliyah did not have a problem with being considered one. "I know that people think I'm sexy and I am looked at as that, and it is cool with me," she stated. "It's wonderful to have sex appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I see myself as sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and it can be very appealing." The single "<a href="We%20Need%20a%20Resolution">We Need a Resolution</a>" was argued to have transformed "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman". Aaliyah mentioned that her mother, during her childhood, would take pictures of her and notice a sex appeal. She reinforced her mother's belief by saying that she did feel "sexy for sure" and that she embraced it and was comfortable with this view of her.

In her spare time, she was mostly a home person, which dated back to her younger years, but on occasion went out and played <a href="laser%20tag">laser tag</a>. She reasoned this was due to her liking "the simple things in life". Despite having a prosperous career that allowed her to purchase the vehicle she wanted, Aaliyah revealed during her final interview on August 21, 2001 on "<a href="106%20%26amp%3B%20Park">106 & Park</a>" that she had never owned a car due to living in New York City and hiring a car or driver on a regular basis.

Aaliyah's family played a major role in the course of her career. Aaliyah's father Michael Haughton, who died in 2012, served as her personal manager. Her mother assisted her in her career while brother Rashad Haughton and cousin Jomo Hankerson worked with her consistently. Her father's illness ended his co-management of Aaliyah with her mother Diane Haughton. She ran all of her decisions by Rashad.

Aaliyah was known to have usually been accompanied by members of her family and the "Rock the Boat" filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: "It really boggles everyone [that] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad had to take care of my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." Her friend <a href="Kidada%20Jones">Kidada Jones</a> said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies."

<a href="Gladys%20Knight">Gladys Knight</a>, who had been married to Aaliyah's uncle <a href="Barry%20Hankerson">Barry Hankerson</a>, was essential to the start of Aaliyah's career as she gave her many of her earlier performances. One of their last conversations concerned Aaliyah having difficulty with "another young artist" that she was trying to work with. Knight felt the argument was "petty" and insisted that she remain being who she was in spite of the conflict.

With the release of "Age Ain't Nothing but a Number", rumors circulated of a relationship between Aaliyah and <a href="R.%20Kelly">R. Kelly</a>. Shortly after, there was speculation about a secret marriage with the release of "Age Ain't Nothing but a Number" and the adult content that Kelly had written for Aaliyah. "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" magazine later revealed a marriage certificate that listed the couple married on August 31, 1994, in Sheraton Gateway Suites in <a href="Rosemont%2C%20Illinois">Rosemont, Illinois</a>. Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time, was listed as 18 on the certificate; the illegal marriage was annulled in February 1995 by her parents. The pair continued to deny marriage allegations, stating that neither was married. One particular allegation among the rumor was that Aaliyah wedded R. Kelly without her parents' knowledge.

Aaliyah reportedly developed a friendship with R. Kelly during the recording of her debut album. As she recalled to "Vibe" magazine in 1994, she and R. Kelly would "go watch a movie" and "go eat" when she got tired and would then "come back and work". She described the relationship between her and R. Kelly as being "rather close." In 2016, Kelly said that he was in love with Aaliyah as he was with "anybody else."
In December 1994, Aaliyah told the "Sun-Times" that whenever she was asked about being married to R. Kelly, she urged them not to believe "all that mess" and that she and R. Kelly were "close" and "people took it the wrong way."
In his 2011 book "The Man Behind the Man: Looking From the Inside Out", Demetrius Smith Sr., a former member of R. Kelly's entourage, wrote that R. Kelly told him "in a voice that sounded as if he wanted to burst into tears" that he thought Aaliyah was pregnant.

<a href="Jamie%20Foster%20Brown">Jamie Foster Brown</a> in the 1994 issue of "<a href="Sister%202%20Sister">Sister 2 Sister</a>" wrote that "R. Kelly told me that he and Aaliyah got together and it was just magic." Brown also reported hearing about a relationship between them. "I've been hearing about Robert and Aaliyah for a while—that she was pregnant. Or that she was coming and going in and out of his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men. At 15," Brown said. "you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them."

Aaliyah admitted in court documents that she had lied about her age. In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents' consent. It was reported that she cut off all professional and personal ties with R. Kelly after the marriage was annulled and ceased having contact with him. In 2014, Jomo Hankerson stated that Aaliyah "got villainized" over her relationship with R. Kelly and the scandal over the marriage made it difficult to find producers for her second album. "We were coming off of a multi-platinum debut album and except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy, it was hard for us to get producers on the album." Hankerson also expressed confusion over why "they were upset" with Aaliyah given her age at the time.

Aaliyah was known to avoid answering questions regarding R. Kelly following the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked if she was still in contact with him and if she would ever work with him again. Farley said Aaliyah responded with a "firm, frosty" 'No' to both of the questions. "Vibe" magazine said Aaliyah changed the subject anytime "you bring up the marriage with her". A spokeswoman for Aaliyah told the "Chicago Sun-Times" in 2000 that when "R. Kelly comes up, she doesn't even speak his name, and nobody's allowed to ask about it at all". Kelly later commented that Aaliyah had opportunities to address the pair's relationship after they separated professionally but chose not to.

R. Kelly would have other allegations made about him regarding underage girls in the years following her death and his marriage to Aaliyah was used to evidence his involvement with them. He refused to discuss his relationship with her, citing that she was dead. "Out of respect for her, and her mom and her dad, I will not discuss Aaliyah. That was a whole other situation, a whole other time, it was a whole other thing, and I'm sure that people also know that." Aaliyah's mother Diane Haughton reflected that everything "that went wrong in her life" began with her relationship with R. Kelly. The allegations have been said to have done "little to taint Aaliyah's image or prevent her from becoming a reliable '90s hitmaker with viable sidelines in movies and modeling."

Aaliyah was dating co-founder of <a href="Roc-A-Fella%20Records">Roc-A-Fella Records</a> <a href="Damon%20Dash">Damon Dash</a> at the time of her death and, though they were not formally engaged, in interviews given after Aaliyah's death, Dash claimed the couple had planned to marry. Aaliyah and Dash met through his accountant and formed a friendship. Dash has said he is unsure of how he and Aaliyah started dating and that the two just understood each other. "I don't know [how we got involved], just spending time, you know, we just saw things the same and it was new, you know what I mean? Meeting someone that is trying to do the same thing you are doing in the urban market, in the same urban market place but not really being so urban. It was just; her mind was where my mind was. She understood me and she got my jokes. She thought my jokes were funny."

Dash expressed his belief that Aaliyah was the "one" and claimed the pair were not officially engaged, but had spoken about getting married prior to her death.
Aaliyah publicly never addressed the relationship between her and Dash as being anything but platonic. In May 2001, she hosted a party for Dash's 30th birthday at a New York City club, where they were spotted together and Dash was seen escorting her to a bathroom. Addressing this, Aaliyah stated that she and Dash were just "very good friends" and chose to "keep it at that" for the time being. Just two weeks before her death, Aaliyah traveled from New Jersey to East Hampton, New York to visit Dash at the summer house he shared with <a href="Jay%20Z">Jay Z</a>.

The couple were separated for long periods at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that the time they had together was special. Dash remembered they would "be in a room full of people talking to each other and it felt like everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be like we were the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song "<a href="Miss%20You%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Miss You</a>", released after her death.

On August 25, 2001, at 6:50 p.m. (<a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EDT</a>), Aaliyah and the members of the record company boarded a twin-engine <a href="Cessna%20402">Cessna 402</a>B (<a href="Aircraft%20registration">registration</a> N8097W) at the <a href="Marsh%20Harbour%20Airport">Marsh Harbour Airport</a> in <a href="Abaco%20Islands">Abaco Islands</a>, the Bahamas, to travel to the <a href="Opa-locka%20Airport">Opa-locka Airport</a> in Florida, after they completed filming the music video for "<a href="Rock%20the%20Boat%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Rock the Boat</a>". They had a flight scheduled the following day, but with filming finishing early, Aaliyah and her entourage were eager to return to the United States and made the decision to leave immediately. The designated airplane was smaller than the <a href="Cessna%20404%20Titan">Cessna 404</a> on which they had originally arrived, but the whole party and all of the equipment were accommodated on board. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff, about from the end of the runway and exploded.

Aaliyah and the eight others on board—pilot Luis Morales III, hair stylist Eric Forman, Anthony Dodd, security guard Scott Gallin, family friend Keith Wallace, make-up stylist Christopher Maldonado, and <a href="Blackground%20Records">Blackground Records</a> employees Douglas Kratz and Gina Smith—were all killed. Gallin survived the initial impact and spent his last moments worrying about Aaliyah's condition, according to ambulance drivers. The plane was identified as being owned by Florida-based company Skystream by Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the US <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) in Atlanta. Initial reports of the crash identified Luis Morales as "L Marael".

According to findings from an inquest conducted by the coroner's office in the Bahamas, Aaliyah suffered from "severe burns and a blow to the head", in addition to severe shock and a weak heart. The coroner theorized that she went into such a state of shock that even if she had survived the crash, her recovery would have been nearly impossible given the severity of her injuries. The bodies were taken to the morgue at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau, where they were kept for relatives to help identify them. Some of the bodies were badly burned in the crash.

As the subsequent investigation determined, when the aircraft attempted to depart, it was over its maximum take-off weight by and was carrying one excess passenger, according to its certification.
The <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> report stated that "the airplane was seen lifting off the runway, and then nose down, impacting in a marsh on the south side of the departure end of runway 27 and then exploding in flames." It indicated that the pilot was not approved to fly the plane. Morales falsely obtained his FAA license by showing hundreds of hours never flown, and he may also have falsified how many hours he had flown in order to get a job with his employer, <a href="Blackhawk%20International%20Airways">Blackhawk International Airways</a>. Additionally, <a href="toxicology">toxicology</a> tests performed on Morales revealed traces of <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> and alcohol in his system.

Aaliyah's funeral services were held on August 31, 2001, at the <a href="Frank%20E.%20Campbell%20Funeral%20Chapel">Frank E.Campbell Funeral Home</a> and <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20Ignatius%20Loyola%20%28New%20York%20City%29">St. Ignatius Loyola Church</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Her body was set in a silver-plated copper-deposit <a href="coffin">casket</a>, which was carried in a glass horse-drawn <a href="hearse">hearse</a>. An estimated 800 mourners were in attendance at the procession. Among those in attendance at the private ceremony were <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a>, <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>, <a href="Gladys%20Knight">Gladys Knight</a>, <a href="Lil%27%20Kim">Lil' Kim</a> and <a href="Sean%20Combs">Sean Combs</a>. After the service, 22 white doves were released to symbolize each year of Aaliyah's life. Aaliyah was initially entombed in a crypt at the <a href="Ferncliff%20Mausoleum">Ferncliff Mausoleum</a> in <a href="Hartsdale%2C%20New%20York">Hartsdale, New York</a>; she was later moved to a private room at the left end of a corridor in the Rosewood Mausoleum. The inscription at the bottom of Aaliyah's portrait at the funeral read: "We Were Given a Queen, We Were Given an Angel."

After Aaliyah's death, the German newspaper "<a href="Die%20Zeit">Die Zeit</a>" published excerpts from an interview done shortly before her death, in which she described a recurring dream: "It is dark in my favorite dream. Someone is following me. I don't know why. I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off. Far away. How do I feel? As if I am swimming in the air. Free. Weightless. Nobody can reach me. Nobody can touch me. It's a wonderful feeling."

Immediately after Aaliyah's death, there was uncertainty over whether the music video for "Rock the Boat" would ever air. It made its world premiere on <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">BET's</a> "<a href="Access%20Granted">Access Granted</a>" on October 9, 2001. She won two posthumous awards at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202002">American Music Awards of 2002</a>; Favorite Female R&B Artist and Favorite R&B/Soul Album for "Aaliyah". Her second and final film, "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28film%29">Queen of the Damned</a>", was released in February 2002. Before its release, Aaliyah's brother, Rashad, <a href="dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">re-dubbed</a> some of her lines during post-production. It grossed US$15.2 million in its first weekend, ranking number one at the box office. On the first anniversary of Aaliyah's death, a candlelight vigil was held in <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a>; millions of fans observed a <a href="moment%20of%20silence">moment of silence</a>; and throughout the United States, radio stations played her music in remembrance. In December 2002, a collection of previously unreleased material was released as Aaliyah's first posthumous album, "<a href="I%20Care%204%20U">I Care 4 U</a>". A portion of the proceeds was donated to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund, a program that benefits the Revlon UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program and Harlem's Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. It debuted at number three on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, selling 280,000 copies in its first week. The album's lead single, "<a href="Miss%20You%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Miss You</a>", peaked at number three on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and topped the <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs</a> chart. In August of the following year, clothing retailer <a href="Christian%20Dior%20SA">Christian Dior</a> donated profits from sales in honor of Aaliyah.

In 2005, Aaliyah's second compilation album, "<a href="Ultimate%20Aaliyah">Ultimate Aaliyah</a>" was released in the UK by Blackground Records. "Ultimate Aaliyah" is a three disc set, which included a greatest hits audio CD and a DVD. Andy Kellman of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> remarked ""Ultimate Aaliyah" adequately represents the shortened career of a tremendous talent who benefited from some of the best songwriting and production work by Timbaland, Missy Elliott, and R. Kelly." A documentary movie "Aaliyah Live in Amsterdam" was released in 2011, shortly before the tenth anniversary of Aaliyah's death. The documentary, by <a href="Pogus%20Caesar">Pogus Caesar</a>, contained previously unseen footage shot of her career beginnings in 1995 when she was appearing in the Netherlands.

In March 2012, music producer Jeffrey "J-Dub" Walker announced on his Twitter account that a song "Steady Ground", which he produced for Aaliyah's third album, would be included in the forthcoming posthumous Aaliyah album. This second proposed posthumous album would feature this song using demo vocals, as Walker claims the originals were somehow lost by his sound engineer. Aaliyah's brother Rashad later refuted Walker's claim, claiming that "no official album [is] being released and supported by the Haughton family."
On August 5, 2012, a song entitled "<a href="Enough%20Said%20%28song%29">Enough Said</a>" was released online. The song was produced by Noah "40" Shebib and features Canadian rapper <a href="Drake%20%28entertainer%29">Drake</a>. Four days later, Jomo Hankerson confirmed a posthumous album is being produced and that it was scheduled to be released by the end of 2012 by <a href="Blackground%20Records">Blackground Records</a>. The album was reported to include 16 unreleased songs and have contributions from Aaliyah's longtime collaborators <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a> and <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a>, among others. On August 13, Timbaland and Missy Elliott dismissed rumors about being contacted or participating for the project. Elliott's manager Mona Scott-Young said in a statement to "<a href="XXL%20%28magazine%29">XXL</a>", "Although Missy and Timbaland always strive to keep the memory of their close friend alive, we have not been contacted about the project nor are there any plans at this time to participate. We've seen the reports surfacing that they have been confirmed to participate but that is not the case. Both Missy and Timbaland are very sensitive to the loss still being felt by the family so we wanted to clear up any misinformation being circulated." Elliott herself said, "Tim and I carry Aaliyah with us everyday, like so many of the people who love her. She will always live in our hearts. We have nothing but love and respect for her memory and for her loved ones left behind still grieving her loss. They are always in our prayers."

In June 2013, Aaliyah was featured on a new track by <a href="Chris%20Brown%20%28American%20entertainer%29">Chris Brown</a>, titled "<a href="Don%27t%20Think%20They%20Know">Don't Think They Know</a>"; with Aaliyah singing the song's hook. The video features dancing holographic versions of Aaliyah. The song appears on Brown's sixth studio album, "<a href="X%20%28Chris%20Brown%20album%29">X</a>". Timbaland voiced his disapproval for "Enough Said" and "Don't Think They Know" in July 2013. He exclaimed, "Aaliyah music only work with its soulmate, which is me". Soon after, Timbaland apologized to Chris Brown over his remarks, which he explained were made due to Aaliyah and her death being a "very sensitive subject".
In January 2014, producer Noah "40" Shebib confirmed that the posthumous album was shelved due to the negative reception surrounding Drake's involvement. Shebib added, "Aaliyah's mother saying, 'I don't want this out' was enough for me ... I walked away very quickly."

Aaliyah's vocals were reported to be featured on the <a href="T-Pain">T-Pain</a> mixtape, "The Iron Way", on the track "Girlfriend", but were pulled after being met with criticism by fans and many in attendance at a New York listening session that he hosted for the project. In response to the criticism, T-Pain questioned if Aaliyah's legacy was driven by her death and claimed that were she still alive, she would be seen as trying to emulate <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>. According to T-Pain, he was given her vocals from a session she had done prior to her death after being approached to work on a track for a posthumous Aaliyah album and completing the song, calling the exchange "just like a swap."

She was featured on the <a href="Tink%20%28musician%29">Tink</a> track "Million", which was released in May 2015 and contained samples from her song "One in a Million". Collaborator Timbaland was involved in the song's creation, having previously claimed that Aaliyah appeared to him in a dream and stressed that Tink was "the one".

In August 2015, Timbaland confirmed that he had unreleased vocals from Aaliyah and stated a "sneak peek" would be coming soon.

In September 2015, "Aaliyah by <a href="Xyrena">Xyrena</a>", an official tribute fragrance was announced.

On December 19, 2015, <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a> uploaded a snippet of a new Aaliyah song title "He Keeps Me Shakin" on his <a href="Instagram">Instagram</a> account and said it would be released December 25, 2015, on the Timbaland mixtape "King Stays King". On August 24, 2017 <a href="MAC%20Cosmetics">MAC Cosmetics</a> announced that an Aaliyah collection will be made available in the summer of 2018 

Aaliyah has been credited for helping redefine <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>, <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> in the 1990s, "leaving an indelible imprint on the music industry as a whole." According to "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", Aaliyah revolutionized <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> with her sultry mix of <a href="pop%20music">pop</a>, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>. In a 2001 review of her eponymous album, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" professed that Aaliyah's impact on R&B and pop has been enormous. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote Aaliyah ranks among the "elite" artists of the R&B genre, as she "played a major role in popularizing the stuttering, futuristic production style that consumed hip-hop and urban soul in the late 1990s." Bruce Britt of "music world" on Broadcast Music, Inc's. website stated that by combining "schoolgirl charm with urban grit", Aaliyah helped define the teen-oriented sound that has resulted in contemporary pop phenom's like Brandy, Christina Aguilera and Destiny's Child.

Described as one of "R&B's most important artists" during the 1990s, her second studio album, "<a href="One%20in%20a%20Million%20%28Aaliyah%20album%29">One in a Million</a>", became one of the most influential R&B albums of the decade. Music critic <a href="Simon%20Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a> cited "Are You That Somebody?" as "the most radical pop single" of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah "knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line", and consequently "helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of <a href="Destiny%27s%20Child">Destiny's Child</a> owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'." Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah "had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years." Music publication "Popdust" called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground due mainly to her influence on the underground alternative music scene, which consists of heavy sampling and references to her music by underground artists. "Popdust" also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah did with <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a> and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are somewhat cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, <a href="MTV%20Hive">MTV Hive</a> mentioned that it's easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R&B movements. With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, Aaliyah earned the <a href="honorific%20nicknames%20in%20popular%20music">nicknames</a> "Princess of R&B" and "Queen of Urban Pop", as she "proved she was a muse in her own right". Ernest Hardy of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" dubbed her as the "undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on". Aaliyah has been referred to as a <a href="pop%20icon">pop icon</a> and a <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> icon for her impact and contributions to those respective genres. Japanese pop singer <a href="Hikaru%20Utada">Hikaru Utada</a> has said several times that "It was when I heard Aaliyah's "<a href="Age%20Ain%27t%20Nothing%20but%20a%20Number">Age Ain't Nothing but a Number</a>" that I got hooked on R&B.", after which Utada released her debut album "<a href="First%20Love%20%28Hikaru%20Utada%20album%29">First Love</a>" with heavy R&B influences. Another Japanese pop singer <a href="Crystal%20Kay">Crystal Kay</a> has expressed how she admired Aaliyah when she was growing up and how she would practice dancing while watching her music videos.

Aaliyah was honored at the <a href="2001%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2001 MTV Video Music Awards</a> by <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>, <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a>, <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>, <a href="Ginuwine">Ginuwine</a> and her brother, Rashad, who all paid tribute to her. In the same year, the United States <a href="Social%20Security%20Administration">Social Security Administration</a> ranked the name Aaliyah one of the 100 most popular names for newborn girls. Aaliyah was ranked as one of "The Top 40 Women of the Video Era" in <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s 2003 "The Greatest" series. She was also ranked at number 18 on <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">BET's</a> "Top 25 Dancers of All Time". Aaliyah appeared on both 2000 and 2001 list of "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>" Hot 100 in position 41 and the latter at 14. In 2002 <a href="VH1">VH1</a> created the 100 sexiest artist list and Aaliyah was ranked at number 36. In memory of Aaliyah, the <a href="Entertainment%20Industry%20Foundation">Entertainment Industry Foundation</a> created the Aaliyah Memorial Fund to donate money raised to charities she supported. In December 2009, "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine ranked Aaliyah at number 70 on its Top Artists of the Decade, while her <a href="Aaliyah%20%28album%29">eponymous album</a> was ranked at number 181 on the magazine's Top 200 Albums of the Decade. She is listed by "Billboard" as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years, and 27th most successful R&B artist overall. In 2012, VH1 ranked her number 48 in "VH1's Greatest Women in Music". Also in 2012, Aaliyah was ranked at number 10 on <a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a> magazine's 100 hottest female singers of all-time list and number 22 on their 90 hottest women of the 90's list. In 2014, "<a href="NME">NME</a>" ("New Musical Express") ranked Aaliyah at number 18 on <a href="NME">NME</a>'s 100 most influential artist list. Aaliyah's dress that she wore at the 2000 <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award">MTV Video Music Award</a>'s was featured in the most memorable fashion moments at the VMA's list by the fashion publication <a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a> In October 2015 Aaliyah was featured in the 10 women who became Denim Style icons list created by the fashion publication <a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>.

Aaliyah's music has influenced numerous artists including <a href="Adele">Adele</a>, <a href="The%20Weeknd">The Weeknd</a>, <a href="Ciara">Ciara</a>, <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>, <a href="Monica%20%28entertainer%29">Monica</a>, <a href="Chris%20Brown">Chris Brown</a>, <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>, <a href="Azealia%20Banks">Azealia Banks</a>, <a href="Sevyn%20Streeter">Sevyn Streeter</a>, <a href="Keyshia%20Cole">Keyshia Cole</a>, <a href="J.%20Cole">J.

Canadian R&B singer <a href="Keshia%20Chant%C3%A9">Keshia Chanté</a> who was said to play as her in her pending biopic back in 2008, complimented the singer's futuristic style in music and fashion.
Chanté backed out of the biopic after speaking to Diane Haughton, but has expressed a willingness to do the project if "the right production comes along and the family's behind it". Keisha also mentioned that Aaliyah had been part of her life "since I was 6."
R&B singer and friend <a href="Brandy%20Norwood">Brandy</a> said about the late singer "She came out before Monica and I did, she was our inspiration. At the time, record companies did not believe in kid acts and it was just inspiring to see someone that was winning and winning being themselves. When I met her I embraced her, I was so happy to meet her." Rapper <a href="Drake%20%28rapper%29">Drake</a> said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. <a href="Solange%20Knowles">Solange Knowles</a> remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. <a href="Adam%20Levine">Adam Levine</a>, the lead vocalist of the <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a> group <a href="Maroon%205">Maroon 5</a>, remembers that listening to "<a href="Are%20You%20That%20Somebody%3F">Are You That Somebody?</a>" convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now you see a lot of artists doing that and finding success," her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album "One in a Million" was "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R&B sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which "really stood out" at its time, was being replicated.

In 2012, British singer-songwriter <a href="Katy%20B">Katy B</a> released the song "Aaliyah" as a tribute to Aaliyah's legacy and lasting impression on R&B music. The song first appeared on Katy B's "Danger" EP and featured <a href="Jessie%20Ware">Jessie Ware</a> on guest vocals. In 2016, Swedish singer-songwriter <a href="Erik%20Hassle">Erik Hassle</a> released a song titled "If Your Man Only Knew" which serves as a tribute to Aaliyah's 1996 single "<a href="If%20Your%20Girl%20Only%20Knew">If Your Girl Only Knew</a>".

There has been continuing belief that Aaliyah would have achieved greater career success had it not been for her death. Emil Wilbekin mentioned the deaths of <a href="The%20Notorious%20B.I.G.">The Notorious B.I.G.</a> and <a href="Tupac%20Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a> in conjunction with hers and added: "Her just-released third album and scheduled role in a sequel to "The Matrix" could have made her another <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a> or <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>". Director of "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Damned">Queen of the Damned</a>" <a href="Michael%20Rymer">Michael Rymer</a> said of Aaliyah, "God, that girl could have gone so far" and spoke of her having "such a clarity about what she wanted. Nothing was gonna step in her way. No ego, no nervousness, no manipulation. There was nothing to stop her."

On July 18, 2014, it was announced that <a href="Alexandra%20Shipp">Alexandra Shipp</a> replaced <a href="Zendaya">Zendaya</a> for the role of Aaliyah for the <a href="Lifetime%20%28TV%20network%29">Lifetime</a> TV biopic movie "", which premiered on November 15, 2014. Zendaya drew criticism because people felt that she was too light skinned and did not greatly resemble Aaliyah. She voiced her strong respect for Aaliyah before dropping out of the project. She explained her choice to withdraw from the film in videos on Instagram. Aaliyah's family has been vocal in their disapproving of the film. Her cousin Jomo Hankerson stated the family would prefer a "major studio release along the lines" of "<a href="What%27s%20Love%20Got%20to%20Do%20with%20It%20%28film%29">What's Love Got to Do with It</a>", the biopic based on the life of <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a>. Aaliyah's family has consulted a lawyer to stop Lifetime from using "any of the music, or any of the photographs and videos" they own and Jomo Hankerson claimed the TV network "didn't reach out." On August 9, 2014, it was announced that Chattrisse Dolabaille and Izaak Smith had been cast as Aaliyah's collaborators Missy Elliott and Timbaland. Dolabaille received criticism for her appearance in comparison with that of Missy Elliot. Despite negative reviews, the film's premiere drew 3.2 million viewers, becoming the second highest rated television movie of 2014.
In February 2015, a tribute dinner was held for Aaliyah by The Sugar Club in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, Ireland.

Armour

An armour (<a href="British%20English">British English</a>) or armor (<a href="American%20English">American English</a>; <a href="American%20and%20British%20English%20spelling%20differences%23-our%2C%20-or">see spelling differences</a>) is a protective covering that is used to prevent damage from being inflicted to an object, individual or vehicle by direct contact <a href="weapon">weapon</a>s or <a href="projectile">projectile</a>s, usually during combat, or from damage caused by a potentially dangerous environment or action (e.g., cycling, construction sites, etc.).

<a href="Personal%20armour">Personal armour</a> is used to protect soldiers and <a href="war%20animal">war animal</a>s. <a href="Vehicle%20armour">Vehicle armour</a> is used on <a href="warship">warship</a>s and <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a>s.

A second use of the term armour describes <a href="Division%20%28military%29%23Armoured%20division">armoured forces</a>, <a href="Armour%23Armoured%20fighting%20vehicles">armoured weapons</a>, and their role in combat. After the evolution of <a href="armoured%20warfare">armoured warfare</a>, <a href="mechanised%20infantry">mechanised infantry</a> and their weapons came to be referred to collectively as "armour".

The word "armour" began to appear in the Middle Ages as a derivative of Old French. It is dated from 1297 as a "mail, defensive covering worn in combat". The word originates from the Old French "armure", itself derived from the Latin "armatura" meaning "arms and/or equipment", with the root "armare" meaning "arms or gear".

Armour has been used throughout <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a>. It has been made from a variety of materials, beginning with rudimentary leather protection and evolving through <a href="Mail%20%28armour%29">mail</a> and metal plate into today's modern <a href="composite%20armour">composites</a>. For much of <a href="military%20history">military history</a> the manufacture of metal personal armour has dominated the technology and employment of armour. Armour drove the development of many important technologies of the Ancient World, including wood <a href="laminate">lamination</a>, mining, <a href="Refining%20%28metallurgy%29">metal refining</a>, vehicle manufacture, leather processing, and later decorative metal working. Its production was influential in the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a>, and furthered commercial development of metallurgy and engineering. Armour was the single most influential factor in the development of <a href="firearm">firearm</a>s, which in turn revolutionised warfare.

Significant factors in the development of armour include the economic and technological necessities of its production. For instance, <a href="plate%20armour">plate armour</a> first appeared in <a href="Middle%20Ages">Medieval Europe</a> when water-powered trip hammers made the formation of plates faster and cheaper. Also, modern militaries usually do not equip their forces with the best armour available because it would be prohibitively expensive. At times the development of armour has paralleled the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armourers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.

Well-known armour types in <a href="European%20history">European history</a> include the <a href="lorica%20hamata">lorica hamata</a>, <a href="lorica%20squamata">lorica squamata</a>, and the <a href="lorica%20segmentata">lorica segmentata</a> of the <a href="Roman%20legions">Roman legions</a>, the <a href="mail%20%28armour%29">mail</a> <a href="hauberk">hauberk</a> of the early medieval age, and the full steel plate harness worn by later <a href="medieval">medieval</a> and <a href="renaissance">renaissance</a> <a href="knight">knight</a>s, and breast and back plates worn by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914–15). The <a href="samurai">samurai</a> warriors of feudal Japan utilised <a href="Japanese%20armour">many types of armour</a> for hundreds of years up to the 19th century.

<a href="Cuirass">Cuirass</a>es and helmets were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century."Tankō", worn by foot soldiers and "keikō", worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early <a href="Japanese%20armour">Japanese armour</a> constructed from iron plates connected together by leather thongs. Japanese lamellar armour ("keiko") passed through Korea and reached Japan around the 5th century. These early Japanese lamellar armours took the form of a sleeveless jacket, leggings and a helmet.

Armour did not always cover all of the body; sometimes no more than a helmet and leg plates were worn. The rest of the body was generally protected by means of a large shield. Examples of armies equipping their troops in this fashion were the Aztecs (13th to 15th century CE).

In East Asia many types of armour were commonly used at different times by various cultures including, <a href="scale%20armour">scale armour</a>, <a href="lamellar%20armour">lamellar armour</a>, <a href="laminar%20armour">laminar armour</a>, <a href="plated%20mail">plated mail</a>, <a href="Chainmail">mail</a>, <a href="plate%20armour">plate armour</a> and <a href="brigandine">brigandine</a>. Around the dynastic Tang, Song, and early Ming Period, cuirasses and plates (mingguangjia) were also used, with more elaborate versions for officers in war. The Chinese, during that time used partial plates for "important" body parts instead of covering their whole body since too much plate armour hinders their martial arts movement. The other body parts were covered in cloth, leather, lamellar, or Mountain pattern. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armour was made out of various animals, with more exotic ones such as the rhinoceros.

<a href="Mail%20%28armour%29">Mail</a>, sometimes called "chainmail", made of interlocking iron rings is believed to have first appeared some time after 300 BC. Its invention is credited to the <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, the Romans were thought to have adopted their design.

Gradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. Hardened leather and <a href="splint%20armour">splinted</a> construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The <a href="coat%20of%20plates">coat of plates</a> was developed, an armour made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat.

Early plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th–15th century, were made of iron. Iron armour could be <a href="Carburising">carburised</a> or <a href="Case%20hardening">case hardened</a> to give a surface of harder steel. Plate armour became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labour and labour had become much more expensive after the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>, though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger <a href="Bloomery">blooms</a>. Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.

The small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the <a href="bascinet">bascinet</a>, as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century.
Probably the most recognised style of armour in the World became the <a href="plate%20armour">plate armour</a> associated with the <a href="knight">knight</a>s of the European <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, but continuing to the early 17th century <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> in all European countries.

By about 1400 the full harness of plate armour had been developed in armouries of Lombardy. Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armour.

In the early 15th century, advances in weaponry allowed infantry to defeat armoured knights on the battlefield. The quality of the metal used in armour deteriorated as armies became bigger and armour was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14–15th centuries armour seldom weighed more than 15 kg, then by the late 16th century it weighed 25 kg. The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th century armour therefore gave substantial resistance.

In the early years of low velocity firearms, full suits of armour, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range. In effect, rather than making plate armour obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armour into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebuseers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 18th century. It was the only way they could be mounted and survey the overall battlefield with safety from distant musket fire.

The horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate <a href="barding">barding</a>. This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight. Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armour.

Gradually, starting in the mid-16th century, one plate element after another was discarded to save weight for foot soldiers.

Back and breast plates continued to be used throughout the entire period of the 18th century and through Napoleonic times, in many European (heavy) cavalry units, until the early 20th century. From their introduction, <a href="musket">musket</a>s could pierce plate armour, so cavalry had to be far more mindful of the fire. In Japan armour continued to be used until the end of the samurai era, with the last major fighting in which armour was used happening in 1868. <a href="Japanese%20armour">Samurai armour</a> had one last short lived use in 1877 during the <a href="Satsuma%20Rebellion">Satsuma Rebellion</a>.

Though the age of the knight was over, armour continued to be used in many capacities. Soldiers in the American Civil War bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected body armour for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely—some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives, but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.

At the start of World War I, thousands of the French <a href="Cuirassier">Cuirassier</a>s rode out to engage the German Cavalry. By that period, the shiny armour plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic style helmets. Their armour was meant to protect only against <a href="sabre">sabre</a>s and light <a href="lance">lance</a>s. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity <a href="rifle">rifle</a>s and <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, unlike the foot soldiers, who at least had a <a href="trench">trench</a> to protect them.

Today, <a href="ballistic%20vest">ballistic vest</a>s, also known as <a href="flak%20jacket">flak jacket</a>s, made of ballistic cloth (e.g. <a href="kevlar">kevlar</a>, <a href="dyneema">dyneema</a>, <a href="twaron">twaron</a>, <a href="Ultra-high-molecular-weight%20polyethylene">spectra</a> etc.) and ceramic or metal plates are common among police forces, <a href="security%20guard">security staff</a>, <a href="prison%20officer">corrections officers</a> and some branches of the military.

The US Army has adopted <a href="Interceptor%20body%20armour">Interceptor body armour</a>, which uses Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (E-S.A.P.I) in the chest, sides and back of the armour. Each plate is rated to stop a range of ammunition including 3 hits from a <a href="7.62%C3%9751%20NATO">7.62×51 NATO</a> AP round at a range of . <a href="Dragon%20Skin%20body%20armour">Dragon Skin body armour</a> is another ballistic vest which is currently in testing with mixed results.

The first modern production technology for armour plating was used by navies in the construction of the <a href="Ironclad%20warship">Ironclad warship</a>, reaching its pinnacle of development with the <a href="battleship">battleship</a>. The first <a href="tanks">tanks</a> were produced during World War I. Aerial armour has been used to protect pilots and aircraft systems since the First World War.

In modern ground forces' usage, the meaning of armour has expanded to include the role of troops in combat. After the evolution of <a href="armoured%20warfare">armoured warfare</a>, <a href="mechanised%20infantry">mechanised infantry</a> were mounted in armoured fighting vehicles and replaced <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> in many situations. In modern armoured warfare, armoured units equipped with tanks and <a href="infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">infantry fighting vehicle</a>s serve the historic role of both the <a href="heavy%20cavalry">battle cavalry</a>, <a href="light%20cavalry">light cavalry</a> and <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>s, and belong to the armoured branch.

The first <a href="ironclad">ironclad</a> battleship, with iron armour over a wooden hull, "<a href="French%20battleship%20La%20Gloire">La Gloire</a>", was launched by the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> in 1859 prompting the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> to build a counter. The following year they launched <a href="HMS%20Warrior%20%281860%29">HMS "Warrior"</a>, which was twice the size and had iron armour over an iron hull. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hampton%20Roads">first battle between two ironclads</a> took place in 1862 during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the <a href="Ship%20of%20the%20line">unarmoured line-of-battle ship</a> as the most powerful warship afloat.

Ironclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, coastal defence ships, and long-range <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s. The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel which carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea), more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.

The rapid pace of change in the ironclad period meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were complete, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the <a href="naval%20ram">ram</a> or the <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>, which a number of naval designers considered the crucial weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term "ironclad" dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a>s.

<a href="Armoured%20train">Armoured train</a>s saw use during the 19th century in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> (1861–1865), the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> (1870–1871), the <a href="First%20Boer%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second</a> Boer Wars (1880–81 and 1899–1902),the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a> (1919–1921); the <a href="World%20War%20I">First</a> (1914–1918) and <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World Wars</a> (1939–1945) and the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a> (1946–1954). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> (1918–1920).

<a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">Armoured cars</a> saw use during World wars 1 and 2.

During the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> on 15 November 1899, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, then a war-correspondent, was travelling on board an armoured train when it was ambushed by "Boer commandos". Churchill and many of the train's garrison were captured, though many others escaped, including wounded placed on the train's engine.

Ancient <a href="siege%20engines">siege engines</a> were usually protected by wooden armour, often covered with wet hides or thin metal to prevent being easily burned.

Medieval <a href="war%20wagon">war wagon</a>s were horse-drawn wagons that were similarly armoured. These contained guns or crossbowmen that could fire through gun-slits.

The first modern <a href="Armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">AFVs</a> were <a href="armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured cars</a>, developed circa 1900. These started as ordinary wheeled motor-cars protected by iron shields, typically mounting a <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the stalemate of <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> during on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> spurred the development of the <a href="tank">tank</a>. It was envisioned as an armoured machine that could advance under fire from enemy rifles and machine guns, and respond with its own heavy guns. It utilized <a href="caterpillar%20track">caterpillar track</a>s to cross ground broken up by shellfire and trenches.

With the development of effective <a href="anti-aircraft%20artillery">anti-aircraft artillery</a> in the period before the Second World War, military pilots, once the "knights of the air" during the First World War, became far more vulnerable to ground fire. As a response armour plating was added to aircraft to protect aircrew and vulnerable areas such as fuel tanks and engine.

Tank armour has progressed from the Second World War armour forms, now incorporating not only harder <a href="Composite%20armour">composites</a>, but also <a href="reactive%20armour">reactive armour</a> designed to defeat <a href="shaped%20charge">shaped charge</a>s. As a result of this, the <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a> (MBT) conceived in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era can survive multiple <a href="Rocket-propelled%20grenade">RPG</a> strikes with minimal effect on the crew or the operation of the vehicle. The <a href="light%20tank">light tank</a>s that were the last descendants of the <a href="light%20cavalry">light cavalry</a> during the Second World War have almost completely disappeared from the world's militaries due to increased lethality of the weapons available to the vehicle-mounted infantry.

The <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a> (APC) was devised during World War I. It allows the safe and rapid movement of infantry in a combat zone, minimising casualties and maximising mobility. APCs are fundamentally different from the previously used armoured <a href="half-track">half-track</a>s in that they offer a higher level of protection from artillery <a href="Air%20burst">burst</a> fragments, and greater mobility in more terrain types. The basic APC design was substantially expanded to an <a href="Infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">Infantry fighting vehicle</a> (IFV) when properties of an armoured personnel carrier and a <a href="light%20tank">light tank</a> were combined in one vehicle.

Naval armour has fundamentally changed from the Second World War doctrine of thicker plating to defend against <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29">shells</a>, <a href="bomb">bomb</a>s and <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es. Passive defence naval armour is limited to <a href="kevlar">kevlar</a> or steel (either single layer or as <a href="spaced%20armour">spaced armour</a>) protecting particularly vital areas from the effects of nearby impacts. Since ships cannot carry enough armour to completely prevent penetration by <a href="anti-ship%20missile">anti-ship missile</a>s, they depend more on destroying an incoming missile before it hits, or causing it to miss its target.

Although the role of the ground attack aircraft significantly diminished after the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, it re-emerged during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and in the recognition of this, the US Air Force authorised the design and production of what became the <a href="A-10%20Thunderbolt%20II">A-10</a> dedicated anti-armour and <a href="ground-attack%20aircraft">ground-attack aircraft</a> that first saw action in the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>.

Armoured fighting vehicle

An armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) is an armed <a href="combat%20vehicle">combat vehicle</a> protected by <a href="vehicle%20armour">armour</a>, generally combining <a href="operational%20mobility">operational mobility</a> with <a href="Military%20tactics">tactical</a> <a href="Offensive%20%28military%29">offensive</a> and <a href="defense%20%28military%29">defensive</a> capabilities. AFVs can be wheeled or <a href="tracked">tracked</a>. <a href="Tank">Tank</a>s, <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured cars</a>, armoured <a href="self-propelled%20gun">self-propelled gun</a>s, and <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s are all examples of AFVs. It is not uncommon for AFVs in general to be simply referred to as "armour".

The concept of a highly mobile and protected fighting unit has been around for centuries; from <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>'s war elephants to <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo</a>'s war machines, military strategists endeavoured to maximize the mobility and survivability of their soldiers. Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics. This classification is not absolute; at different times different countries will classify the same vehicle in different roles. For example, <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s were generally replaced by <a href="infantry%20fighting%20vehicle">infantry fighting vehicle</a>s in a similar role, but the latter has some capabilities lacking in the former. There may also be hybrid vehicles, such as the <a href="Stryker">Stryker</a> family of AFVs; the <a href="M1128%20Mobile%20Gun%20System">M1128 Mobile Gun System</a>, an <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured car</a> which mounts a large 105 mm gun normally used in <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a>s and <a href="tank">tank</a>s, but can theoretically be reconfigured to the <a href="M1126%20Infantry%20Carrier%20Vehicle">M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicle</a>.

Successful general-purpose armoured fighting vehicles often also serve as the base of a whole family of specialized vehicles, for example, the <a href="M113%20armored%20personnel%20carrier">M113</a> and <a href="MT-LB">MT-LB</a> tracked carriers, and the <a href="MOWAG%20Piranha">MOWAG Piranha</a> wheeled AFV.

The AFV classification did not exist prior to the key innovations leading to the invention of the <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion engine</a>, armour plating, the <a href="continuous%20track">continuous track</a> and the advent of <a href="armoured%20warfare">armoured warfare</a> in the 20th century.

Modern armoured fighting vehicles represent the realization of an ancient concept - that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower. Armies have deployed war machines and cavalries with rudimentary armour in battle for millennia. Use of these animals and engineering designs sought to achieve a balance between the conflicting <a href="paradox">paradox</a>ical needs of mobility, firepower and protection.

<a href="Siege%20engine">Siege engine</a>s, such as <a href="battering%20ram">battering ram</a>s and <a href="siege%20tower">siege tower</a>s, would often be armoured in order to protect their crews from enemy action. <a href="Polyidus%20of%20Thessaly">Polyidus of Thessaly</a> developed a very large movable siege tower, the "<a href="helepolis">helepolis</a>", as early as 340 BC, and Greek forces used such structures in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Rhodes%20%28305%20BC%29">Siege of Rhodes</a> (305 BC).

The idea of a protected fighting vehicle has been known since antiquity. Frequently cited is <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>'s 15th-century sketch of a <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci%27s%20fighting%20vehicle">mobile, protected gun-platform</a>; the drawings show a conical, wooden shelter with apertures for cannons around the circumference. The machine was to be mounted on four wheels which would be turned by the crew through a system of <a href="Hand%20crank%23Hand-powered%20cranks">hand cranks</a> and <a href="Gear%23Cage%20gear">cage (or "lantern") gears</a>. Leonardo claimed: "I will build armored wagons which will be safe and invulnerable to enemy attacks. There will be no obstacle which it cannot overcome." Modern replicas have demonstrated that the human crew would have been able to move it over only short distances.

<a href="Hussite">Hussite</a> forces in <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> developed <a href="war%20wagon">war wagon</a>s - <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> weapon-platforms - around 1420 during the <a href="Hussite%20Wars">Hussite Wars</a>. These heavy wagons were given protective sides with firing slits; their heavy firepower came from either a cannon or from a force of hand-gunners and crossbowmen, supported by <a href="infantry">infantry</a> using pikes and flails. Heavy <a href="arquebus">arquebus</a>es mounted on wagons were called "arquebus à croc". These carried a ball of about .

The first modern AFVs were armed cars, dating back virtually to the invention of the <a href="Car">motor car</a>. The British inventor <a href="Frederick%20Richard%20Simms">F.R. Simms</a> designed and built the <a href="Motor%20Scout">Motor Scout</a> in 1898. It was the first armed, petrol-engine powered vehicle ever built. It consisted of a <a href="De%20Dion-Bouton">De Dion-Bouton</a> <a href="Quadracycle">quadricycle</a> with a <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim machine gun</a> mounted on the front bar. An iron shield offered some protection for the driver from the front, but it lacked all-around protective armour.

The <a href="armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured car</a> was the first modern fully armoured fighting vehicle. The first of these was the <a href="Motor%20War%20Car">Simms' Motor War Car</a>, designed by <a href="Frederick%20Richard%20Simms">Simms</a> and built by <a href="Vickers%23Vickers%2C%20Sons%20%26amp%3B%20Maxim">Vickers, Sons & Maxim</a> in 1899. The vehicle had Vickers armour 6 mm thick and was powered by a four-cylinder 3.3-litre 16 <a href="Horsepower">hp</a> Cannstatt Daimler engine giving it a maximum speed of around . The armament, consisting of two <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim gun</a>s, was carried in two turrets with 360° traverse.

Another early armoured car of the period was the French <a href="Charron%2C%20Girardot%20et%20Voigt%201902">Charron, Girardot et Voigt 1902</a>, presented at the "Salon de l'Automobile et du cycle" in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, on 8 March 1902. The vehicle was equipped with a <a href="Hotchkiss%20machine%20gun">Hotchkiss machine gun</a>, and with 7 mm armour for the gunner. Armoured cars were first used in large numbers on both sides during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> as scouting vehicles.

The development of the AFV took a great leap forward during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, when Britain and France developed the tracked <a href="tank">tank</a> to break the stalemate on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. The tank was envisioned as an armoured machine that could cross ground under fire from <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s and respond with fire from mounted guns. It was to move on <a href="caterpillar%20track">caterpillar track</a>s to enable it to cross ground broken up by shellfire and trenches.

In Great Britain, the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, formed the <a href="Landships%20Committee">Landships Committee</a> on 20 February 1915. The <a href="Director%20of%20Naval%20Construction">Director of Naval Construction</a> for the Royal Navy, <a href="Eustace%20Tennyson%20d%27Eyncourt">Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt</a>, was appointed to head the Committee in view of his experience with the engineering methods it was felt might be required. The first design, <a href="Little%20Willie">Little Willie</a>, ran for the first time in September 1915 and served to develop the form of the track, but an improved design - better able to cross trenches - swiftly followed, and in January 1916 the prototype, nicknamed "Mother", was adopted as the design for future tanks. Production models of <a href="Male%20tank">"Male"</a> tanks (armed with naval cannon and machine guns) and <a href="Female%20tank">"Females"</a> (carrying only machine-guns) would go on to fight in history's first tank action at <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">the Somme</a> in September 1916. Great Britain produced about 2,600 tanks of various types during the war.

In 1916 the French pioneered the use of a full 360° rotating <a href="gun%20turret">turret</a> in a tank for the first time, designing the <a href="Renault%20FT">Renault FT</a> light tank, with the turret containing the tank's main armament. In addition to the traversible turret, another innovative feature of the FT was its engine located at the rear. This pattern, with the gun located in a mounted turret and the engine at the back, became the standard for most succeeding tanks across the world. The FT was the most numerous tank of the War; over 3,000 were made by late 1918.

The tank eventually proved highly successful, and as technology improved it became a weapon that could cross large distances at much higher speeds than supporting <a href="infantry">infantry</a> and <a href="artillery">artillery</a>. The need to provide the units that would fight alongside the tank led to the development of a wide range of specialised AFVs, especially during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> (1939-1945).

The <a href="Armoured%20personnel%20carrier">Armoured personnel carrier</a>, designed to transport infantry troops to the frontline, emerged towards the end of World War I. During the first actions with <a href="tank">tank</a>s it had become clear that close contact with infantry was essential in order to secure ground won by the tanks. Troops on foot were vulnerable to enemy fire, but they could not be transported in the tank because of the intense heat and noxious atmosphere. In 1917 Lieutenant G.R. Rackham was ordered to design an armoured vehicle that could fight and carry troops or supplies. The <a href="Mark%20IX%20tank">Mark IX tank</a> was built by <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong, Whitworth & Co.</a>, although just three vehicles were finished at the time of the <a href="Armistice">Armistice</a> in November 1918, and only 34 were built in total.

Different tank classifications emerged in the interwar period. The <a href="tankette">tankette</a> was conceived as a mobile, two-man model, mainly intended for reconnaissance. In 1925 <a href="Sir%20John%20Carden%2C%206th%20Baronet">Sir John Carden</a> and <a href="Vivian%20Loyd">Vivian Loyd</a> produced the first such design – the <a href="Carden%20Loyd%20tankette">Carden Loyd tankette</a>. Tankettes saw use in the Italian <a href="Regio%20Esercito">Royal Army</a> during the <a href="Second%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">Italian invasion of Ethiopia</a> (1935-1936), the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> (1936-1939), and almost everywhere Italian soldiers fought during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> used tankettes for <a href="jungle%20warfare">jungle warfare</a>.

The British <a href="Gun%20Carrier%20Mark%20I">Gun Carrier Mark I</a>, the first <a href="Self-propelled%20artillery">Self-propelled artillery</a>, was fielded in 1917. It was based on the first <a href="tank">tank</a>, the British <a href="Mark%20I%20%28tank%29">Mark I</a>, and carried a heavy field-gun. The next major advance was the <a href="Birch%20gun">Birch gun</a> (1925), developed for the motorised warfare experimental brigade (the <a href="Experimental%20Mechanized%20Force">Experimental Mechanized Force</a>). This mounted a field gun, capable of the usual artillery trajectories, on a tank-style chassis.

During World War II, most major military powers developed self-propelled artillery vehicles. These had mounted guns on a tracked chassis (often that of an obsolete or superseded tank) and provided an armoured superstructure to protect the gun and its crew. The first British design, <a href="Bishop%20%28artillery%29">"Bishop"</a>, carried the <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2025%20pounder">25 pdr gun-howitzer</a>, but in a mounting that severely limited the gun's performance. It was replaced by the more effective <a href="Sexton%20%28artillery%29">Sexton</a>. The Germans built many lightly armored self-propelled anti-tank guns using captured French equipment (for example <a href="Marder%20I">Marder I</a>), their own obsolete light tank chassis (<a href="Marder%20II">Marder II</a>), or ex-Czech chassis (<a href="Marder%20III">Marder III</a>). These led to better-protected tank destroyers, built on a medium-tank chassis such as the <a href="Jagdpanzer%20IV">Jagdpanzer IV</a> or the <a href="Jagdpanther">Jagdpanther</a>.

The <a href="Self-propelled%20anti-aircraft%20weapon">Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon</a> debuted in WWI. The German 77 mm anti-aircraft gun was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks, and the British <a href="QF%203%20inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3 inch 20 cwt</a> was mounted on trucks for use on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. Although the <a href="Birch%20gun">Birch gun</a> was a general purpose artillery piece on an armoured tracked chassis, it was capable of elevation for anti-aircraft use. <a href="Vickers%20Armstrong">Vickers Armstrong</a> developed one of the first SPAAGs based on the chassis of the Mk.E 6-ton light tank/Dragon Medium Mark IV tractor, mounting a Vickers QF-1 "Pom-Pom" gun of 40 mm. The Germans fielded the SdKfz 10/4 and 6/2, cargo halftracks mounting single 20 mm or 37 mm AA guns (respectively) by the start of the War.

Rocket launchers such as the Soviet <a href="Katyusha%20rocket%20launcher">Katyusha</a> originated in the late 1930s. The <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> fielded self-propelled rocket artillery in World War II - the <a href="Panzerwerfer">Panzerwerfer</a> and <a href="Wurfrahmen%2040">Wurfrahmen 40</a> equipped half-track armoured fighting vehicles. 

By the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, most modern armies had vehicles to carry infantry, artillery and <a href="anti-aircraft%20weapon">anti-aircraft weapon</a>ry. Most modern AFVs are superficially similar in design to their World War II counterparts, but with significantly better armour, weapons, engines, electronics, and suspension. The increase in the capacity of <a href="Military%20transport%20aircraft">transport aircraft</a> makes possible and practicable the transport of AFVs by air. Many armies are replacing some or all of their traditional heavy vehicles with lighter airmobile versions, often with wheels instead of tracks.

The level of armour protection between AFVs varies greatly – a <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a> will normally be designed to take hits from other tank guns and anti-tank <a href="missile%23Anti-tank">missiles</a>, whilst light <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> vehicles are often only armoured "just in case". Whilst heavier armour provides better protection, it makes vehicles less mobile (for a given engine power), limits its air-transportability, increases cost, uses more fuel and may limit the places it can go – for example, many bridges may be unable to support the weight of a main battle tank. A trend toward <a href="composite%20armour">composite armour</a> is taking place in place of steel – composites are stronger for a given weight, allowing the tank to be lighter for the same protection as steel armour, or better protected for the same weight. Armour is being supplemented with <a href="active%20protection%20system">active protection system</a>s on a number of vehicles, allowing the AFV to protect itself from incoming projectiles.

The level of protection also usually varies considerably throughout the individual vehicle too, depending on the role of the vehicle and the likely direction of attack. For example, a main battle tank will usually have the heaviest armour on the hull front and the turret, lighter armour on the sides of the hull and the thinnest armour on the top and bottom of the tank. Other vehicles – such as the <a href="MRAP">MRAP</a> family – may be primarily armoured against the threat from <a href="Improvised%20explosive%20device">IEDs</a> and so will have heavy, <a href="sloped%20armour">sloped armour</a> on the bottom of the hull.

Weaponry varies by a very wide degree between AFVs – lighter vehicles for infantry carrying, reconnaissance or specialist roles may have only a <a href="Cannon">Cannon</a> or <a href="Machine%20gun">Machine gun</a> (or no armament at all), whereas heavy <a href="self%20propelled%20artillery">self propelled artillery</a> will carry large guns, <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a> or <a href="rocket%20%28weapon%29">rocket</a> launchers. These weapons may be mounted on a <a href="weapon%20mount%23Pintle">pintle</a>, affixed directly to the vehicle or placed in a <a href="gun%20turret">turret</a> or cupola.

The greater the recoil a weapon on an AFV is, the larger the turret ring needs to be. A larger turret ring necessitates a larger vehicle. To avoid listing to the side, turrets are usually located at the centre of the vehicle on vehicles that are capable of amphibious operations.

<a href="Grenade%20launcher">Grenade launcher</a>s provide a versatile launch platform for a plethora of munitions including, <a href="Smoke%20grenade">smoke</a>, phosphorus, tear gas, illumination, anti-personnel, infrared and radar-jamming rounds.

Turret stabilization is an important capability because it enables firing on the move and prevents crew fatigue.

Modern AFVs have primarily used either petrol (gasoline) or diesel piston engines. More recently gas turbines have been used. Most early AFVs used <a href="petrol%20engine">petrol engine</a>s, as they offer a good <a href="power-to-weight%20ratio">power-to-weight ratio</a>. However, they fell out of favour during <a href="World%20War%20Two">World War Two</a> due to the flammability of the fuel.

Most current AFVs are powered by a <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>; modern technology including the use of <a href="turbocharger">turbo-charging</a> help to overcome the lower power-to-weight ratio of diesel engines compared to petrol.

<a href="Gas%20turbine">Gas turbine</a> (turboshaft) engines offer a very high power-to-weight ratio and were starting to find favour in the late 20th century – however they offer very poor fuel consumption and as such some armies are switching from gas turbines back to diesel engines (i.e. the Russian <a href="T-80">T-80</a> used a gas turbine engine, whereas the later <a href="T-90">T-90</a> does not). The US <a href="M1%20Abrams">M1 Abrams</a> is a notable example of a gas turbine powered tank.

Notable armoured fighting vehicles extending from post-World War I to today.

The <a href="tank">tank</a> is an all terrain AFV designed to fill almost all battlefield roles and to engage enemy forces by the use of <a href="direct%20fire">direct fire</a> in the frontal assault role. Though several configurations have been tried, particularly in the early experimental "golden days" of tank development, a standard, mature design configuration has since emerged to a generally accepted pattern. This features a main <a href="tank%20gun">tank gun</a> or <a href="artillery">artillery</a> <a href="gun">gun</a>, mounted in a fully rotating <a href="turret">turret</a> atop a tracked automotive hull, with various additional secondary weapon systems throughout.

Philosophically, the tank is, by its very nature, an offensive weapon. Being a protective encasement with at least one gun position, it is essentially a <a href="Pillbox%20%28military%29">pillbox</a> or small <a href="fortress">fortress</a> (though these are static fortifications of a purely defensive nature) that can move toward the enemy – hence its offensive utility. Psychologically, the tank is a <a href="force%20multiplier">force multiplier</a> that has a positive morale effect on the infantry it accompanies. It also instills fear in the opposing force who can often hear and even feel their arrival.

Tanks were classified either by size or by role.

Classification by relative size was common, as this also tended to influence the tanks' role.
Over time, tanks tended to be designed with heavier armour and weapons, increasing the weight of all tanks, so these classifications are relative to the average for the nation's tanks for any given period. An older tank design might be reclassified over time, such as a tank being first deployed as a medium tank, but in later years relegated to light tank roles.

Tanks were also classified by roles that were independent of size, such as <a href="cavalry%20tank">cavalry tank</a>, <a href="cruiser%20tank">cruiser tank</a>, <a href="fast%20tank">fast tank</a>, <a href="infantry%20tank">infantry tank</a>, <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a>, "assault" tank, or "breakthrough" tank. Military theorists initially tended to assign tanks to traditional military infantry, cavalry, and artillery roles, but later developed more specialized roles unique to tanks.

In modern use, the heavy tank has fallen out of favour, being supplanted by more heavily armed and armoured descendant of the medium tanks – the universal <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>. The light tank has, in many armies, lost favour to cheaper, faster, lighter <a href="Armoured%20car%20%28military%29">armoured cars</a>; however, light tanks (or similar vehicles with other names) are still in service with a number of forces as <a href="reconnaissance%20vehicle">reconnaissance vehicle</a>s, most notably the <a href="Naval%20Infantry%20%28Russia%29">Russian Marines</a> with the <a href="PT-76">PT-76</a>, the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> with the <a href="FV107%20Scimitar">Scimitar</a>, and the <a href="Chinese%20Army">Chinese Army</a> with the <a href="Type%2063%20%28tank%29">Type 63</a>.
Modern <a href="Main%20battle%20tank%23Main%20battle%20tank%20%28late%20twentieth%20century%29">main battle tanks</a> or "universal tanks" incorporate recent advances in automotive, artillery, armour, and electronic technology to combine the best characteristics of the historic medium and heavy tanks into a single, all around type. They are also the most expensive to mass-produce. It is distinguished by its high level of firepower, mobility and armour protection relative to other vehicles of its era. It can cross comparatively rough terrain at high speeds, but its heavy-dependency on fuel, maintenance, and ammunition makes it <a href="Military%20logistics">logistically</a> demanding. It has the heaviest <a href="Vehicle%20armour">armour</a> of any AFVs on the battlefield, and carries a powerful <a href="precision-guided%20munition">precision-guided munition</a> weapon systems that may be able to engage a wide variety of both ground targets and air targets. Despite significant advances in <a href="anti-tank%20warfare">anti-tank warfare</a>, it still remains the most versatile and fearsome land-based weapon-systems of the 21st-century, valued for its <a href="fear">shock action</a> and high <a href="survivability">survivability</a>.
A tankette is a tracked armed and armoured vehicle resembling a small "ultra-light tank" roughly the size of a car, mainly intended for light infantry support or <a href="reconnaissance">scouting</a>. They were one or two-man vehicles armed with a machine gun. Colloquially it may also simply mean a "small tank".

Tankettes were designed and built by several nations between the 1920s and 1940s. They were very popular with smaller countries. Some saw some combat (with limited success) in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. However, the vulnerability of their light armour eventually caused the concept to be abandoned.

The term "super-heavy tank" has been used to describe armoured fighting vehicles of extreme size, generally over 75 tonnes. Programs have been initiated on several occasions with the aim of creating an invincible <a href="siegeworks">siegeworks</a>/<a href="Breakthrough%20%28military%29">breakthrough</a> vehicle for penetrating enemy formations and fortifications without fear of being destroyed in combat. Examples were designed in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> (such as the <a href="Panzer%20VIII%20Maus">Panzer VIII Maus</a>), along with a few in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. However, few working prototypes were built and there are no clear evidence any of these vehicles saw combat, as their immense size would have made most designs impractical.
A flame tank is an otherwise-standard <a href="tank">tank</a> equipped with a <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a>, most commonly used to supplement <a href="combined%20arms">combined arms</a> attacks against <a href="fortification">fortification</a>s, confined spaces, or other obstacles. The type only reached significant use in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, during which the United States, <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, Japan and the United Kingdom (including members of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a>) all produced flamethrower-equipped tanks. Usually, the flame projector replaced one of the tank's machineguns, however, some flame projectors replaced the tank's main gun. Fuel for the flame weapon was generally carried inside the tank, although a few designs mounted the fuel externally, such as the armoured trailer used on the <a href="Churchill%20Crocodile">Churchill Crocodile</a>.

Flame tanks have been superseded by <a href="thermobaric%20weapon">thermobaric weapon</a>s such as the Russian <a href="TOS-1">TOS-1</a>.
The idea for this tank was developed during World War I by British and French. The <a href="infantry">infantry</a> tank was designed to work in concert with infantry in the assault, moving mostly at a walking pace, and carrying heavy armour to survive defensive fire. Its main purpose was to suppress enemy fire, crush obstacles such as barbed-wire entanglements, and protect the infantry on their advance into and through enemy lines by giving mobile <a href="overwatch%20%28military%20tactic%29">overwatch</a> and <a href="cover%20%28military%29">cover</a>. The French <a href="Renault%20FT">Renault FT</a> was the first iteration of this concept.

The British and French retained the concept between the wars and into the Second World War era. Because infantry tanks did not need to be fast, they could carry heavy armour. One of the best-known infantry tanks was the <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda II</a> of World War II. Other examples include the French <a href="Renault%20R35">R-35</a>, the British <a href="Valentine%20Tank">Valentine</a>, and the British <a href="Churchill%20Tank">Churchill</a>.

A cruiser tank, or cavalry tank, was designed to move fast and exploit penetrations of the enemy front. The idea originated in "<a href="Plan%201919">Plan 1919</a>", a British plan to break the trench deadlock of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in part via the use of high-speed tanks. The first cruiser tank was the British <a href="Medium%20Mark%20A%20Whippet">Whippet</a>.

Between the wars, this concept was implemented in the "fast tanks" pioneered by <a href="J.%20Walter%20Christie">J. Walter Christie</a>. These led to the Soviet <a href="BT%20Tank">BT tank series</a> and the British <a href="Cruiser%20tank">cruiser tank series</a>.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, British cruiser tanks were designed to complement <a href="infantry%20tank">infantry tank</a>s, exploiting gains made by the latter to attack and disrupt the enemy rear areas. In order to give them the required speed, cruiser designs sacrificed armour and armament compared to the infantry tanks. Pure British cruisers were generally replaced by more capable medium tanks such as the <a href="Sherman%20Tank">US Sherman</a> and, to a lesser extent, the <a href="Cromwell%20tank">Cromwell</a> by 1943.

The Soviet fast tank ("bistrokhodniy tank", or <a href="BT%20tank">BT tank</a>) classification also came out of the infantry/cavalry concept of armoured warfare and formed the basis for the British cruisers after 1936. The T-34 was a development of this line of tanks as well, though their armament, armour, and all-round capability places them firmly in the medium tank category.
The <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured car</a> is a wheeled, often lightly armoured, vehicle adapted as a fighting machine. Its earliest form consisted of a motorised ironside chassis fitted with firing ports. By <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, this had evolved into a mobile fortress equipped with command equipment, searchlights, and machine guns for self-defence. It was soon proposed that the requirements for the armament and layout of armoured cars be somewhat similar to those on naval craft, resulting in turreted vehicles. The first example carried a single revolving cupola with a <a href="Vickers%20gun">Vickers gun</a>; modern armoured cars may boast heavier armament – ranging from twin machine guns to large calibre cannon.

Some multi-axled wheeled fighting vehicles can be quite heavy, and superior to older or smaller tanks in terms of armour and armament. Others are often used in military marches and processions, or for the escorting of important figures. Under peacetime conditions, they form an essential part of most standing armies. Armoured car units can move without the assistance of transporters and cover great distances with fewer logistical problems than tracked vehicles.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, armoured cars were used for reconnaissance alongside scout cars. Their guns were suitable for some defence if they encountered enemy <a href="armoured%20vehicles">armoured vehicles</a>, but they were not intended to engage enemy <a href="tanks">tanks</a>. <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">Armoured cars</a> have since been used in the offensive role against tanks with varying degrees of success, most notably during the <a href="South%20African%20Border%20War">South African Border War</a>, <a href="Toyota%20War">Toyota War</a>, the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Kuwait">Invasion of Kuwait</a>, and other <a href="Low%20intensity%20conflict">lower-intensity conflicts</a>.

An "aerosani" (, literally "aerosled") is a type of propeller-driven <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a>, running on skis, used for communications, mail deliveries, medical aid, emergency recovery and border patrolling in northern <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, as well as for recreation. Aerosanis were used by the Soviet <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> during the <a href="Winter%20War">Winter War</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

The first aerosanis may have been built by young <a href="Igor%20Sikorsky">Igor Sikorsky</a> in 1909–10, before he built multi-engine airplanes and helicopters. They were very light <a href="plywood">plywood</a> vehicles on skis, propelled by old airplane engines and propellers.

A scout car is a military armored <a href="reconnaissance%20vehicle">reconnaissance vehicle</a>, capable of off-road mobility and often carrying mounted weapons such as <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s for offensive capabilities and crew protection. They often only carry an operational crew aboard, which differentiates them from wheeled <a href="armored%20personnel%20carrier">armored personnel carrier</a>s (APCs) and <a href="Infantry%20Mobility%20Vehicle">Infantry Mobility Vehicle</a>s (IMVs), but early scout cars, such as the open-topped US <a href="M3%20Scout%20Car">M3 Scout Car</a> could carry a crew of seven. The term is often used synonymously with the more general term <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armored car</a>, which also includes armored civilian vehicles. They are also differentiated by being designed and built for purpose, as opposed to improved <a href="Technical%20%28vehicle%29">technicals</a> which might serve in the same role.

A reconnaissance vehicle, also known as a scout vehicle, is a <a href="military%20vehicle">military vehicle</a> used for forward <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>. Both tracked and wheeled reconnaissance vehicles are in service. In some nations, light tanks such as the <a href="M551%20Sheridan">M551 Sheridan</a> and <a href="AMX-13">AMX-13</a> are also used by scout platoons. Reconnaissance vehicles are usually designed with a low profile or small size and are lightly armoured, relying on speed and cover to escape detection. Their armament ranges from a medium machine gun to a large cannon. Modern examples are often fitted with <a href="ATGM">ATGM</a>s and a wide range of sensors.

Some <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s and <a href="infantry%20mobility%20vehicle">infantry mobility vehicle</a>, such as the <a href="M113">M113</a>, <a href="TPz%20Fuchs">TPz Fuchs</a>, and <a href="Cadillac%20Gage%20Commando">Cadillac Gage Commando</a> double in the reconnaissance role.

An internal security vehicle (ISV), also known as an armoured security vehicle (ASV), is a combat vehicle used for supporting contingency operations. Security vehicles are typically armed with a turreted <a href="heavy%20machine%20gun">heavy machine gun</a> and auxiliary <a href="medium%20machine%20gun">medium machine gun</a>. The vehicle is designed to minimize firepower dead space and the vehicles weapons can be depressed to a maximum of 12°. <a href="Non-lethal%20weapon">Non-lethal</a> <a href="water%20cannon">water cannon</a>s and <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> cannons can provide suppressive fire in lieu of unnecessary deadly fire.

The vehicle must be protected against weapons typical of riots. Protection from <a href="incendiary%20device">incendiary device</a>s is achieved though coverage of the air intake and exhaust ports as well as a strong locking mechanism on the fuel opening. Turret and door locks prevent access to the interior of the vehicle by rioters. Vision blocks, ballistic glass and window shutters and outside <a href="Closed-circuit%20television">surveillance cameras</a> allow protected observation from within the vehicle. Wheeled 4x4 and 6x6 configurations are typical of security vehicles. Tracked security vehicles are often cumbersome and leave negative political connotations for being perceived as an imperial invading force.

An improvised fighting vehicle is a combat vehicle resulting from modifications to a civilian or military non-combat vehicle in order to give it a fighting capability. Such modifications usually consist of the grafting of <a href="Vehicle%20armour">armour plating</a> and <a href="weapon%20systems">weapon systems</a>. Various militaries have procured such vehicles, ever since the introduction of the first <a href="automobile">automobile</a>s into military service.

During the early days, the absence of a doctrine for the military use of automobiles or of an industry dedicated to producing them, lead to much improvisation in the creation of early <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured cars</a>, and other such vehicles. Later, despite the advent of <a href="arms%20industry">arms industries</a> in many countries, several armies still resorted to using ad hoc contraptions, often in response to unexpected military situations, or as a result of the development of new <a href="Military%20tactics">tactics</a> for which no available vehicle was suitable. The construction of improvised fighting vehicles may also reflect a lack of means for the force that uses them. This is especially true in <a href="Developing%20country">developing countries</a>, where various armies and <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a> forces have used them, as they are more affordable than military-grade combat vehicles.

Modern examples include military gun truck used by units of regular armies or other official government armed forces, based on a conventional cargo <a href="truck">truck</a>, that is able to carry a large weight of weapons and armour. They have mainly been used by regular armies to escort military convoys in regions subject to ambush by <a href="Guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a> forces. "<a href="Narco%20tank">Narco tank</a>s", used by <a href="Mexico">Mexican</a> drug cartels in the <a href="Mexican%20Drug%20War">Mexican Drug War</a>, are built from such trucks, which combines <a href="operational%20mobility">operational mobility</a>, <a href="Military%20tactics">tactical</a> <a href="Offensive%20%28military%29">offensive</a>, and <a href="defense%20%28military%29">defensive</a> capabilities.

Troop-carrying AFVs are divided into three main types – armoured personnel carriers (APCs), infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and infantry mobility vehicles (IMV). The main difference between the three is their intended role – the APC is designed purely to transport troops and is armed for self-defense only – whereas the IFV is designed to provide close-quarters and anti-armour fire support to the infantry it carries. IMV is a wheeled armored personnel carrier serving as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle.

<a href="Armoured%20personnel%20carrier">Armoured personnel carrier</a>s (APCs) are intended to carry infantry quickly and relatively safely to the point where they are deployed. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a>, 8 August 1918, the British <a href="Mk%20V%20tank%23Mark%20V%20series">Mk V* (Mark Five Star) tank</a> carried a small number of machine gunners as an experiment, but the men were debilitated by the conditions inside the vehicle. Later that year the first purpose-built APC, the British <a href="Mark%20IX%20tank">Mk IX</a> (Mark Nine), appeared. In 1944, the Canadian general <a href="Guy%20Simonds">Guy Simonds</a> ordered the conversion of redundant armoured vehicles to carry troops (generically named "<a href="Kangaroo%20%28armoured%20personnel%20carrier%29">Kangaroos</a>"). This proved highly successful, even without training, and the concept was widely used in the <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a>. Post-war, specialised designs were built, such as the Soviet <a href="BTR-60">BTR-60</a> and US <a href="M113%20armored%20personnel%20carrier">M113</a>.

An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), also known as a mechanized infantry combat vehicle (MICV), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry <a href="infantry">infantry</a> into battle and provide <a href="Direct%20fire">direct</a> <a href="fire%20support">fire support</a>. The first example of an IFV was the West German <a href="Sch%C3%BCtzenpanzer%20Lang%20HS.30">Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30</a> which served in the <a href="Bundeswehr">Bundeswehr</a> from 1958 until the early 1980s.
IFVs are similar to <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s (APCs) and <a href="infantry%20carrier%20vehicle">infantry carrier vehicle</a>s (ICVs), designed to transport a <a href="Section%20%28military%20unit%29">section</a> or <a href="squad">squad</a> of infantry (generally between five and ten men) and their equipment. They are differentiated from APCs— which are purely "troop-transport" vehicles armed only for self-defense— because they are designed to give direct fire support to the dismounted infantry and so usually have significantly enhanced armament. IFVs also often have improved <a href="vehicle%20armour">armour</a> and some have firing ports (allowing the infantry to fire <a href="firearm">personal weapons</a> while mounted).

They are typically armed with an <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a> of 20 to 40 mm calibre, 7.62mm machine guns, <a href="anti-tank%20missile">anti-tank missile</a>s (ATGMs) and/or <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a>s (SAMs). IFVs are usually <a href="Caterpillar%20track">tracked</a>, but some wheeled vehicles fall into this category. IFVs are generally less heavily armed and armoured than <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>s. They sometimes carry <a href="anti-tank%20warfare">anti-tank</a> missiles to protect and support infantry against armoured threats, such as the NATO <a href="BGM-71%20TOW">TOW</a> missile and Soviet <a href="9M117%20Bastion">Bastion</a>, which offer a significant threat to tanks. Specially equipped IFVs have taken on some of the roles of light tanks; they are used by reconnaissance organizations, and light IFVs are used by airborne units which must be able to fight without the heavy firepower of tanks.
An infantry mobility vehicle (IMV) or protected patrol vehicle (PPV) is a wheeled <a href="armored%20personnel%20carrier">armored personnel carrier</a> (APC) serving as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle. Examples include the <a href="ATF%20Dingo">ATF Dingo</a>, <a href="AMZ%20Dzik">AMZ Dzik</a>, <a href="AMZ%20Tur">AMZ Tur</a>, <a href="Mungo%20ESK">Mungo ESK</a>, and <a href="Bushmaster%20IMV">Bushmaster IMV</a>. This term also applies to the vehicles currently being fielded as part of the <a href="MRAP">MRAP</a> program.

IMVs were developed in response to the threats of modern counter insurgency warfare, with an emphasis on <a href="Ambush">Ambush</a> Protection and <a href="Improvised%20Explosive%20Device">Mine</a>-Resistance. Similar vehicles existed long before the term IMV was coined, such as the French <a href="V%C3%A9hicule%20de%20l%27Avant%20Blind%C3%A9">VAB</a> and South African <a href="Buffel">Buffel</a>. The term is coming more into use to differentiate light 4x4 wheeled APCs from the traditional 8x8 wheeled APCs. It is a <a href="neologism">neologism</a> for what might have been classified in the past as an armoured <a href="scout%20car">scout car</a>, such as the <a href="BRDM">BRDM</a>, but the IMV is distinguished by having a requirement to carry dismountable infantry. The up-armoured <a href="M1114">M1114</a> Humvee variant can be seen as an adaptation of the unarmoured Humvee to serve in the IMV role.

Many modern military vehicles, ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance, through <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s and <a href="tank">tank</a>s, are manufactured with amphibious capabilities. Contemporary wheeled armoured amphibians include the French <a href="V%C3%A9hicule%20de%20l%27Avant%20Blind%C3%A9">Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé</a> and <a href="V%C3%A9hicule%20Blind%C3%A9%20L%C3%A9ger">Véhicule Blindé Léger</a>. The latter is a small, lightly armoured <a href="4x4">4x4</a> all-terrain vehicle that is fully amphibious and can swim at 5.4 km/h. The VAB ("Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé" - "Armoured Vanguard Vehicle") is a fully amphibious <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a> powered in the water by two water jets, that entered service in 1976 and produced in numerous configurations, ranging from basic personnel carrier, anti-tank missile platform.

During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> the <a href="Soviet%20bloc">Soviet bloc</a> states developed a number of amphibious APCs, fighting vehicles and tanks, both wheeled and tracked. Most of the vehicles the Soviets designed were amphibious, or could ford deep water. Wheeled examples are the <a href="BRDM-1">BRDM-1</a> and <a href="BRDM-2">BRDM-2</a> <a href="4x4">4x4</a> armoured scout cars, as well as the <a href="BTR-60">BTR-60</a>, <a href="BTR-70">BTR-70</a>, <a href="BTR-80">BTR-80</a> and <a href="BTR-94">BTR-94</a> <a href="8x8">8x8</a> armoured personnel carriers and the <a href="BTR-90">BTR-90</a> infantry fighting vehicle.

The United States started developing a long line of <a href="Landing%20Vehicle%20Tracked">Landing Vehicle Tracked</a> (LVT) designs from ca. 1940. The US Marine Corps currently uses the AAV7-A1 <a href="Assault%20Amphibious%20Vehicle">Assault Amphibious Vehicle</a>, which was to be succeeded by the <a href="Expeditionary%20Fighting%20Vehicle">Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle</a>, which was capable of planing on water and can achieve water speeds of 37–46 km/h. The EFV project has been cancelled.

A significant amount of tracked armoured vehicles that are primarily intended for land-use, have some amphibious cability, tactically useful inland, reducing dependence on bridges. They use their tracks, sometimes with added propeller or water jets for propulsion. As long as the banks have a shallow enough slopes to enter or leave the water they can cross rivers and water obstacles.

Some heavy tanks can operate amphibiously with a fabric skirt to add <a href="buoyancy">buoyancy</a>. The <a href="M4%20Sherman">Sherman</a> <a href="DD%20tank">DD tank</a> used in the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a> had this setup. When in water the waterproof float screen was raised and propellers deployed. Some modern vehicles use a similar skirt.

Modern engineering AFV's utilize chassis based on main battle tank platforms: these vehicles are as well armoured and protected as tanks, designed to keep up tanks, conduct obstacle breaching operations to help tanks get to wherever it needs to be, perform utility functions necessary to expedite mission objectives of tanks, and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield. These vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture. In the United States the term "combat engineer vehicle (CEV)" is used, in the United Kingdom the term "<a href="Armoured%20Vehicle%20Royal%20Engineers">Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers</a> (AVRE)" is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term "armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)" is used. There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes, or lifting booms.

It should be noted that while the term "armoured engineer vehicle" is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank-based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank-based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces. Thus, "armoured engineer vehicle" used generically would refer to AEV, AVLB, Assault Breachers, and so on. Good examples of this type of vehicle include the UK <a href="Trojan%20Armoured%20Vehicle%20Royal%20Engineers">Trojan AVRE</a>, the Russian IMR, and the US <a href="M728%20Combat%20Engineer%20Vehicle">M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle</a>.

An assault breacher vehicle (ABV), also known as a explosive ordnance disposal vehicle (EODV), or simply Breacher, is especially designed to clear pathways for troops and other vehicles through <a href="minefields">minefields</a> and along <a href="roadside%20bomb">roadside bomb</a>s and <a href="Improvised%20Explosive%20Device">Improvised Explosive Device</a>s. These vehicles are based on a tank-chassis with 1,500+ horsepower engines, but fitted with a 50-caliber machine gun and a front-mounted 5-meter-wide plow, supported by metallic skis that glide on the dirt and typically equipped with at least of <a href="Mine%20Clearing%20Line%20Charge">Mine Clearing Line Charge</a>s: rockets carrying <a href="C-4%20%28explosive%29">C-4</a> explosives up to 100–150 meters forward, detonating hidden bombs at a safe distance, so that troops and vehicles can pass through safely. They were called ""the answer"" to the deadliest threat facing NATO troops in modern asymmetrical conflict.

The armored <a href="bulldozer">bulldozer</a> is a basic tool of <a href="combat%20engineering">combat engineering</a>. These <a href="combat%20engineering%20vehicle">combat engineering vehicle</a>s combine the earth moving capabilities of the bulldozer with armor which protects the vehicle and its operator in or near combat. Most are civilian bulldozers modified by addition of <a href="vehicle%20armor">vehicle armor</a>/military equipment, but some are <a href="tank">tank</a>s stripped of armament and fitted with a dozer blade. Some tanks have bulldozer blades while retaining their armament, but this does not make them armored bulldozers as such, because combat remains the primary role – earth moving is a secondary task.

An armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) is a type of <a href="Vehicle%20recovery%20%28military%29">vehicle recovery</a> armoured fighting vehicle used to repair battle- or mine-damaged as well as broken-down armoured vehicles during combat, or to tow them out of the danger zone for more extensive repairs. To this end the term ""Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle" (ARRV)" is also used.

ARVs are normally built on the <a href="chassis">chassis</a> of a <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a> (MBT), but some are also constructed on the basis of other armoured fighting vehicles, mostly <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s (APCs). ARVs are usually built on the basis of a vehicle in the same class as they are supposed to recover; a tank-based ARV is used to recover tanks, while an APC-based one recovers APCs, but does not have the power to tow a much heavier tank.

An armoured vehicle-launched bridge (AVLB) is a combat support vehicle, sometimes regarded as a subtype of <a href="combat%20engineering%20vehicle">combat engineering vehicle</a>, designed to assist militaries in rapidly deploying <a href="tank">tank</a>s and other armoured fighting vehicles across rivers. The AVLB is usually a tracked vehicle converted from a tank chassis to carry a folding metal bridge instead of weapons. The AVLB's job is to allow armoured or infantry units to cross water, when a river too deep for vehicles to wade through is reached, and no bridge is conveniently located (or sufficiently sturdy, a substantial concern when moving 60-ton tanks).

The bridge layer unfolds and launches its cargo, providing a ready-made bridge across the obstacle in only minutes. Once the span has been put in place, the AVLB vehicle detaches from the bridge, and moves aside to allow traffic to pass. Once all of the vehicles have crossed, it crosses the bridge itself and reattaches to the bridge on the other side. It then retracts the span ready to move off again. A similar procedure can be employed to allow crossings of small chasms or similar obstructions. AVLBs can carry bridges of or greater in length. By using a tank chassis, the bridge layer is able to cover the same terrain as <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>s, and the provision of armour allows them to operate even in the face of enemy fire. However, this is not a universal attribute: some exceptionally sturdy 6x6 or 8x8 truck chassis have lent themselves to bridge-layer applications.
The combat engineer section carriers are used to transport <a href="sapper">sapper</a>s (<a href="combat%20engineer">combat engineer</a>s) and can be fitted with a <a href="bulldozer">bulldozer</a>'s blade and other mine-breaching devices. They are often used as APCs because of their carrying ability and heavy protection. They are usually armed with <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s and grenade launchers and usually tracked to provide enough tractive force to push blades and rakes. Some examples are the U.S. <a href="M113%20Armored%20Personnel%20Carrier">M113 APC</a>, <a href="IDF%20Puma">IDF Puma</a>, <a href="Nagmachon">Nagmachon</a>, Husky, and U.S. <a href="M1132%20Engineer%20Support%20Vehicle">M1132 ESV</a> (a <a href="Stryker">Stryker</a> variant).

An anti-aircraft vehicle, also known as a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon (SPAA) or self-propelled air defense system (SPAD), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability. The Russian equivalent of SPAAG is ZSU (from "zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka" – "anti-aircraft self-propelled mount"). Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, autocannons, larger guns, or missiles, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles. Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as APCs and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment. Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly traversing turret with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. Today, missiles (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns.

Self-propelled <a href="artillery">artillery</a> vehicles give mobility to <a href="artillery">artillery</a>. Within the term are covered <a href="self-propelled%20gun">self-propelled gun</a>s (or <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s) and <a href="rocket%20artillery">rocket artillery</a>. They are highly mobile, usually based on tracked chassis carrying either a large howitzer or other field gun or alternatively a <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range <a href="indirect-fire">indirect</a> bombardment support on the battlefield.

In the past, self-propelled artillery has included direct-fire "Gun Motor Carriage" vehicles such as <a href="assault%20gun">assault gun</a>s and <a href="tank%20destroyer">tank destroyer</a>s (also known as self-propelled anti-tank guns). These have been heavily armoured vehicles, the former providing danger-close fire-support for infantry and the latter acting as specialized anti-tank vehicles.

Modern self-propelled artillery vehicles may superficially resemble tanks, but they are generally lightly armoured, too lightly to survive in direct-fire combat. However, they protect their crews against <a href="shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel</a> and small arms and are therefore usually included as armoured fighting vehicles. Many are equipped with <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s for defence against enemy infantry.

The key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster. Before the towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and set up the guns. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought — usually towed — to the new location. By comparison self-propelled artillery in combination with modern communications can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance.

Conversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach, so despite the advantages of the self-propelled artillery, towed guns remain in the <a href="arsenal">arsenal</a>s of many modern armies.
An assault gun is a gun or howitzer mounted on a motor vehicle or armoured chassis, designed for use in the <a href="direct%20fire">direct fire</a> role in support of <a href="infantry">infantry</a> when attacking other infantry or <a href="fortified">fortified</a> positions.

Historically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed <a href="casemate">casemate</a> on a tank chassis. The use of a casemate instead of a <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a> limited these weapons <a href="field%20of%20fire%20%28weaponry%29">field of fire</a>, but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armour to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.
A mortar carrier is a <a href="self-propelled%20artillery">self-propelled artillery</a> vehicle carrying a <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> as its primary weapon. Mortar carriers cannot be fired while on the move and some must be dismounted to fire. In U.S. Army doctrine, mortar carriers provide close and immediate indirect fire support for maneuver units while allowing for rapid displacement and quick reaction to the tactical situation. The ability to relocate not only allows fire support to be provided where it is needed faster but also allows these units to avoid <a href="counter-battery%20fire">counter-battery fire</a>. Mortar carriers have traditionally avoided direct contact with the enemy. Many units report never using secondary weapons in combat.

Prior to the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>, American 120 mm mortar platoons reorganized from six <a href="M1064%20mortar%20carrier">M1064 mortar carrier</a>s and two M577 fire direction centers (FDC) to four M1064 and one FDC. The urban environment of Iraq made it difficult to utilize mortars. New technologies such as mortar ballistic computers and communication equipment and are being integrated. Modern era combat is becoming more reliant on <a href="direct%20fire">direct fire</a> support from mortar carrier <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s.
A multiple rocket launcher is a type of unguided <a href="rocket%20artillery">rocket artillery</a> system. Like other <a href="rocket">rocket</a> artillery, multiple rocket launchers are less accurate and have a much lower (sustained) rate of fire than batteries of traditional <a href="artillery">artillery</a> guns. However, they have the capability of simultaneously dropping many hundreds of kilograms of explosive, with devastating effect.

The Korean <a href="Hwacha">Hwacha</a> is an example of an early weapon system with a resemblance to the modern-day multiple rocket launcher. The first modern multiple rocket launcher was the German "<a href="Nebelwerfer">Nebelwerfer</a>" of the 1930s, a small towed artillery piece. Only later in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> did the Allies deploy similar weapons in the form of the <a href="Mattress%20%28rocket%29">Land Mattress</a>.

The first self-propelled multiple rocket launchers – and arguably the most famous – were the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="Katyusha%20rocket%20launcher">BM-13 Katyushas</a>, first used during World War II and exported to Soviet allies afterwards. They were simple systems in which a rack of launch rails was mounted on the back of a truck. This set the template for modern multiple rocket launchers. The Americans mounted tubular launchers atop <a href="M4%20Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> tanks to create the <a href="T34%20Calliope">T34 Calliope</a> rocket launching tank, only used in small numbers, as their closest equivalent to the Katyusha.

Tank destroyers and tank hunters are armed with an <a href="anti-tank%20gun">anti-tank gun</a> or missile launcher, and are designed specifically to engage enemy armoured vehicles. Many have been based on a tracked tank chassis, while others are wheeled. Since World War II, main battle tanks have largely replaced gun-armed tank destroyers; although lightly armoured anti tank guided missile (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank engagements.

In post-<a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> conflict, the resurgence of <a href="expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary warfare</a> has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called "protected gun systems", which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers, but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low intensity operations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. These have the advantage of easier deployment, as only the largest air transports can carry a main battle tank, and their smaller size makes them more effective in urban combat.

Many forces' IFVs carry anti-tank missiles in every infantry platoon, and attack helicopters have also added anti-tank capability to the modern battlefield. But there are still dedicated anti-tank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, or intended for airborne use. There have also been dedicated anti-tank vehicles built on ordinary armoured personnel carrier or armoured car chassis. Examples include the U.S. M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle) and the Norwegian NM142, both on an <a href="M113">M113</a> chassis, several Soviet ATGM launchers based on the <a href="BRDM-2">BRDM reconnaissance car</a>, the British FV438 <a href="Swingfire">Swingfire</a> and <a href="FV102%20Striker">FV102 Striker</a> and the German Raketenjagdpanzer series built on the chassis of the HS 30 and Marder IFV.

An armoured train is a railway train protected with <a href="vehicle%20armour">armour</a>. They are usually equipped with railroad cars armed with <a href="artillery">artillery</a> and <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s. They were mostly used during the late 19th and early 20th century, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of firepower. Their use was discontinued in most countries when road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and because armoured trains were too vulnerable to track sabotage as well as attacks from the air. However, the <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n Federation used improvised armoured trains in the <a href="Second%20Chechen%20War">Second Chechen War</a> in the late 1990s and 2000s.

The railroad cars on an armoured train were designed for many tasks such as carrying guns and machine guns, infantry units, anti-aircraft guns. During World War II, the Germans would sometimes put a "Fremdgerät" (such as a captured French <a href="Somua%20S-35">Somua S-35</a> or Czech <a href="PzKpfw%2038%28t%29">PzKpfw 38(t)</a> light tank, or <a href="Panzer%20II">Panzer II</a> light tank) on a flatbed car which could be quickly offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy <a href="Partisan%20%28military%29">partisans</a>.

Different types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains.

Armoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a <a href="draisine">draisine</a>. One such example was the 'Littorina' armoured trolley which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92mm <a href="MG-13">MG13</a> machine gun turrets from <a href="Panzer%20I">Panzer I</a> light tanks.

Anton Drexler

Anton Drexler (13 June 1884 – 24 February 1942) was a <a href="German%20people">German</a> <a href="far-right">far-right</a> political leader of the 1920s who was instrumental in the formation of the pan-German and anti-Semitic <a href="German%20Workers%27%20Party">German Workers' Party</a> ("Deutsche Arbeiterpartei" – DAP), the antecedent of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> ("Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei" – NSDAP). Drexler served as mentor to <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> during his early days in politics.

Born in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, Drexler was a machine-fitter before becoming a railway toolmaker and <a href="locksmith">locksmith</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. He joined the <a href="Fatherland%20Party%20%28Germany%29">Fatherland Party</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. 

In March 1918 Drexler founded a branch of "Der Freie Arbeiterausschuss für einen guten Frieden" (Free Workers' Committee for a Good Peace) league. Thereafter in 1918, <a href="Karl%20Harrer">Karl Harrer</a> (a journalist and member of the <a href="Thule%20Society">Thule Society</a>), convinced Drexler and several others to form the "<a href="Politischer%20Arbeiterzirkel">Politischer Arbeiterzirkel</a>" (Political Workers' Circle) in 1918. The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and <a href="Antisemitism">racism directed against Jews</a>. Drexler was a poet and a member of the <a href="V%C3%B6lkisch%20movement">völkisch</a> agitators. 

Together with Harrer, <a href="Gottfried%20Feder">Gottfried Feder</a> and <a href="Dietrich%20Eckart">Dietrich Eckart</a>, he founded the German Workers' Party (DAP) in Munich on 5 January 1919.

At a meeting of the Party in Munich in September 1919, the main speaker was Gottfried Feder. When he had finished speaking, Adolf Hitler got involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Feder's arguments against capitalism and proposed that <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> should break away from <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> and found a new South German nation with <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments he made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills, and according to Hitler, the "professor" left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat. Drexler approached Hitler and thrust a booklet into his hand. It was "My Political Awakening" and, according to Hitler, it reflected the ideals he already believed in. Impressed with Hitler, Drexler invited him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party. In less than a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a DAP member and should come to a "committee" meeting to discuss it. Hitler was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party). Hitler attended the "committee" meeting held at the run-down Alte Rosenbad beer-house.

Hitler began to make the party more public, and he organized their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people, for 24 February 1920 in the <a href="Staatliches%20Hofbr%C3%A4uhaus%20in%20M%C3%BCnchen">Hofbräuhaus</a> in Munich. It was in this speech that Hitler, for the first time, enunciated the <a href="National%20Socialist%20Program%23German%20Party%20program">twenty-five points of the "German Worker's Party"'s manifesto</a> that had been drawn up by Drexler, Feder, and Hitler. Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem with a clear foreign policy (abrogation of The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, a <a href="German%20Question">Greater Germany</a>, Eastern expansion, exclusion of Jews from citizenship). On the same day the party was renamed the "Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei" – NSDAP (Nazi Party). Such was the significance of this particular move in publicity that Karl Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement.

By 1921, Hitler was rapidly becoming the undisputed leader of the Party. In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the NSDAP in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival <a href="German%20Socialist%20Party">German Socialist Party</a> (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed; he rejoined the party as member 3,680. Drexler was thereafter moved to the purely symbolic position of honorary president, and left the Party in 1923.

Drexler was also a member of a "völkisch" political club for affluent members of Munich society known as the <a href="Thule%20Society">Thule Society</a>. His membership in the NSDAP ended when it was temporarily outlawed in 1923 following the <a href="Beer%20Hall%20Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a>, in which Drexler had not taken part. In 1924 he was elected to the Bavarian state parliament for another party, in which he served as vice-president until 1928. He had no part in the NSDAP's refounding in 1925, and rejoined only after Hitler had come to power in 1933. He founded a splinter group, the "Nationalsozialer Volksbund", but this dissolved in 1928. He received the party's <a href="Blood%20Order">Blood Order</a> in 1934 and was still occasionally used as a <a href="Nazi%20propaganda">propaganda</a> tool until about 1937, but he was never again allowed any real power or to play an active part in the movement.

Drexler died in Munich in February 1942.

All Quiet on the Western Front

All Quiet on the Western Front () is a novel by <a href="Erich%20Maria%20Remarque">Erich Maria Remarque</a>, a German veteran of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The book describes the German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many of these soldiers upon returning home from the front.

The novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper "<a href="Vossische%20Zeitung">Vossische Zeitung</a>" and in book form in late January 1929. The book and its sequel, "<a href="The%20Road%20Back">The Road Back</a>" (1930), were among the books banned and <a href="Nazi%20book%20burnings">burned</a> in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. "All Quiet on the Western Front" sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print.

In 1930, the book was adapted as an Academy-Award-winning <a href="All%20Quiet%20on%20the%20Western%20Front%20%281930%20film%29">film of the same name</a>, directed by <a href="Lewis%20Milestone">Lewis Milestone</a>. It was adapted again in 1979 by <a href="Delbert%20Mann">Delbert Mann</a>, this time as <a href="All%20Quiet%20on%20the%20Western%20Front%20%281979%20film%29">a television film</a> starring <a href="Richard%20Thomas%20%28actor%29">Richard Thomas</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a>.

The English translation by <a href="Arthur%20Wesley%20Wheen">Arthur Wesley Wheen</a> gives the title as " All Quiet on the Western Front". The literal translation of "Im Westen nichts Neues" is "In the West Nothing New," with "West" being the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>; the phrase refers to the content of an official communiqué at the end of the novel.

<a href="Brian%20O%20Murdoch">Brian Murdoch's</a> 1993 translation would render the phrase as "there was nothing new to report on the Western Front" within the narrative. Explaining his retention of the original book-title, he says:
Although it does not match the German exactly, Wheen's title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.
The phrase "all quiet on the Western Front" has become a colloquial expression meaning stagnation, or lack of visible change, in any context.

The book tells the story of Paul Bäumer, a German soldier who—urged on by his school teacher—joins the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German army</a> shortly after the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. His class was "scattered over the platoons amongst <a href="Frisians">Frisian</a> fishermen, peasants, and labourers." Bäumer arrives at the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> with his friends and schoolmates (Leer, Müller, Kropp and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older soldier, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul's mentor. While fighting at the front, Bäumer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions of trench warfare.

At the very beginning of the book, Erich Maria Remarque says "This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped (its) shells, were destroyed by the war." The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of <a href="artillery">artillery</a> fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits (meaning lower chances of survival), and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail.

The battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance, except for the impending possibility of injury or death for Bäumer and his comrades. Only pitifully small pieces of land are gained, about the size of a football field, which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken. "We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces."

Paul's visit on leave to his home highlights the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war; however, he finds that he does "not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world." He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him "stupid and distressing" questions about his war experiences, not understanding "that a man cannot talk of such things." An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to Paris while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their "own little sector" of the war but nothing of the big picture.

Indeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender, yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave, he stays up with her, exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other. He thinks to himself, "Ah! Mother, Mother! How can it be that I must part from you? Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say, and we shall never say it." In the end, he concludes that he "ought never to have come [home] on leave."

Paul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die, in pain for hours. He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war.
They are then sent on what Paul calls a "good job." They must guard a supply depot in a village that was evacuated due to being shelled too heavily. During this time, the men are able to adequately feed themselves, unlike the near-starvation conditions in the German trenches. In addition, the men enjoy themselves while living off the spoils from the village and officers' luxuries from the supply depot (such as fine cigars). While evacuating the villagers (enemy civilians), Paul and Albert are taken by surprise by artillery fired at the civilian convoy and wounded by a shell. On the train back home, Albert takes a turn for the worse and cannot complete the journey, instead being sent off the train to recuperate in a Catholic hospital.
Paul uses a combination of bartering and manipulation to stay by Albert's side. Albert eventually has his leg amputated, while Paul is deemed fit for service and returned to the front.

By now, the war is nearing its end and the German Army is retreating. In despair, Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. In the final chapter, he comments that peace is coming soon, but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims or goals left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood. When he dies at the end of the novel, the situation report from the frontline states, "All is Quiet on the Western Front."

One of the major themes of the novel is the difficulty of soldiers to revert to civilian life after having experienced extreme combat situations. Remarque comments in the preface that "[This book] will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war." This internal destruction can be found as early as the first chapter as Paul comments that, although all the boys are young, their youth has left them. In addition, the massive loss of life and negligible gains from the fighting are constantly emphasized. Soldiers' lives are thrown away by their commanding officers who are stationed comfortably away from the front, ignorant of the daily terrors of the front line.

Paul Bäumer is the main character and narrator. At 19 years of age, Paul enlists in the German Army and is deployed to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> where he experiences the severe psychological and physical effects of the war. 
Before the war, Paul was a creative, sensitive and passionate person, writing poems and having a clear love for his family. But as the war changed his attitude and personality, poems and other aspects of his past life become something Paul was no longer linked to, since the horrors of war trained him to disconnect himself from his feelings. He feels he can't tell anyone about his experiences and feels like an outsider where his family is concerned.

By the end of the book, Paul realises that he no longer knows what to do with himself and decides that he has nothing more to lose. The war appears to have snuffed out his hopes and dreams, which he feels he can never regain. After years of fighting in the war, Paul is finally killed in October 1918, on an extraordinarily quiet, peaceful day. The army report that day contains only one phrase: "All quiet on the Western Front." As Paul dies, his face is calm, "as though almost glad the end had come."

Kropp was in Paul's class at school and is described as the clearest thinker of the group as well as the smallest. Kropp is wounded towards the end of the novel and undergoes a <a href="leg%20amputation">leg amputation</a>. Both he and Bäumer end up spending time in a <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> hospital together, Bäumer suffering from shrapnel wounds to the leg and arm. Though Kropp initially plans to commit <a href="suicide">suicide</a> if he requires an amputation, the book suggests he postponed suicide because of the strength of military camaraderie. Kropp and Bäumer part ways when Bäumer is recalled to his regiment after recovering. Paul comments that saying farewell was "very hard, but it is something a soldier learns to deal with."

Haie is described as being tall and strong, and a <a href="peat">peat</a>-digger by profession. Overall, his size and behavior make him seem older than Paul, yet he is the same age as Paul and his school-friends (roughly 19 at the start of the book). Haie, in addition, has a good sense of humor. During combat, he is injured in his back, fatally (Chapter 6)—the resulting wound is large enough for Paul to see Haie's breathing lung when Himmelstoß (Himmelstoss) carries him to safety.

Müller is about 18 and a half years of age, one of Bäumer's classmates, when he also joins the German army as a volunteer to go to the war. Carrying his old school books with him to the battlefield, he constantly reminds himself of the importance of learning and education. Even while under enemy fire, he "mutters propositions in physics". He became interested in Kemmerich's boots and inherits them when Kemmerich dies early in the novel. He is killed later in the book after being shot point-blank in the stomach with a "light pistol" (flare gun). As he was dying "quite conscious and in terrible pain", he gave his boots which he inherited from Kemmerich to Paul.

Kat has the most positive influence on Paul and his comrades on the battlefield. Katczinsky was a cobbler (<a href="shoemaker">shoemaker</a>) in civilian life; he is older than Paul Bäumer and his comrades, about 40 years old, and serves as their leadership figure. He also represents a literary model highlighting the differences between the younger and older soldiers. While the older men have already had a life of professional and personal experience before the war, Bäumer and the men of his age have had little life experience or time for personal growth.

Kat is also well known for his ability to scavenge nearly any item needed, especially food. At one point he secures four boxes of lobster. Bäumer describes Kat as possessing a <a href="Extrasensory%20perception">sixth sense</a>. One night, Bäumer along with a group of other soldiers are holed up in a factory with neither rations nor comfortable bedding. Katczinsky leaves for a short while, returning with straw to put over the bare wires of the beds. Later, to feed the hungry men, Kat brings bread, a bag of horse flesh, a lump of fat, a pinch of salt and a pan in which to cook the food.

Kat is hit by shrapnel at the end of the story, leaving him with a smashed shin. Paul carries him back to camp on his back, only to discover upon their arrival that a stray splinter had hit Kat in the back of the head and killed him on the way. He is thus the last of Paul's close friends to die in battle. It is Kat's death that eventually makes Bäumer careless whether he survives the war or not, but that he can face the rest of his life without fear. "Let the months and the years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear."

One of Bäumer's non-schoolmate friends. Before the war, Tjaden was a locksmith. A big eater with a grudge against the former postman-turned corporal Himmelstoß (thanks to his strict "disciplinary actions"), he manages to forgive Himmelstoß later in the book. Throughout the book, Paul frequently remarks on how much of an eater he is, yet somehow manages to stay as "thin as a rake". The fate of Tjaden is unknown but he appears in the sequel, "<a href="The%20Road%20Back">The Road Back</a>".

Kantorek was the <a href="schoolmaster">schoolmaster</a> of Paul and his friends, including Kropp, Leer, Müller, and Behm. Behaving "in a way that cost [him] nothing," Kantorek is a strong supporter of the war and encourages Bäumer and other students in his class to join the war effort. Among twenty enlistees was Joseph Behm, the first of the class to die in battle. In an example of tragic irony, Behm was the only one who did not want to enter the war.

Kantorek is a hypocrite, urging the young men he teaches to fight in the name of patriotism, while not voluntarily enlisting himself. In a twist of fate, Kantorek is later called up as a soldier as well. He very reluctantly joins the ranks of his former students, only to be drilled and taunted by Mittelstädt, one of the students he had earlier persuaded to enlist.

Leer is an intelligent soldier in Bäumer's company, and one of his classmates. He is very popular with women; when he and his comrades meet three French women, he is the first to seduce one of them. Bäumer describes Leer's ability to attract women by saying "Leer is an old hand at the game". In chapter 11, Leer is hit by a shell fragment, which also hits Bertinck. The shrapnel tears open Leer's hip, causing him to bleed to death quickly. His death causes Paul to ask himself, "What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician in school?"

Lieutenant Bertinck is the leader of Bäumer's <a href="Company%20%28military%29">company</a>. His men have a great respect for him, and Bertinck has great respect for his men. He permits them to eat the rations of the men that had been killed in action, standing up to the chef Ginger who would only allow them their allotted share. Bertinck is genuinely despondent when he learns that few of his men had survived an engagement.

When he and the other characters are trapped in a trench under heavy attack, Bertinck, who has been injured in the firefight, spots a flamethrower team advancing on them. He gets out of cover and takes aim on the flamethrower but misses, and gets hit by enemy fire. With his next shot he kills the flamethrower, and immediately afterwards an enemy shell explodes on his position blowing off his chin. The same explosion also fatally wounds Leer.

Corporal Himmelstoss (spelled Himmelstoß in some editions) was a postman before enlisting in the war. He is a power-hungry corporal with special contempt for Paul and his friends, taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of his trainees during their basic training in preparation for their deployment. Paul later figures that the training taught by Himmelstoss made them "hard, suspicious, pitiless, and tough" but most importantly it taught them comradeship. However, Bäumer and his comrades have a chance to get back at Himmelstoss because of his punishments, mercilessly whipping him on the night before they board trains to go to the front.

Himmelstoss later joins them at the front, revealing himself as a coward who shirks his duties for fear of getting hurt or killed, and pretends to be wounded because of a scratch on his face. Paul Bäumer beats him because of it and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge, Himmelstoss joins and leads the charge. He carries Haie Westhus's body to Bäumer after he is fatally wounded. Matured and repentant through his experiences Himmelstoß later asks for forgiveness from his previous charges. As he becomes the new staff cook, to prove his friendship he secures two pounds of sugar for Bäumer and half a pound of butter for Tjaden.

Detering is a farmer who constantly longs to return to his wife and farm. He is also fond of horses and is angered when he sees them used in combat. He says, "It is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war," when the group hears several wounded horses writhe and scream for a long time before dying during a bombardment. He tries to shoot them to put them out of misery, but is stopped by Kat to keep their current position hidden. He is driven to desert when he sees a cherry tree in blossom, which reminds him of home too much and inspires him to leave. He is found by military police and court-martialed, and is never heard from again.

Hamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are temporarily stationed. He has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital. He also has a "Special Permit," certifying him as sporadically not responsible for his actions due to a head wound, though he is clearly quite sane and exploiting his permit so he can stay in the hospital and away from the war as long as possible.

A young boy of only 19 years. Franz Kemmerich had enlisted in the army for World War I along with his best friend and classmate, Bäumer. Kemmerich is shot in the leg early in the story; his injured leg has to be amputated, and he dies shortly after. In anticipation of Kemmerich's imminent death, Müller was eager to get his boots. While in the hospital, someone steals Kemmerich's watch that he intended to give to his mother, causing him great distress and prompting him to ask about his watch every time his friends visit him in the hospital. Paul later finds the watch and hands it over to Kemmerich's mother, only to lie and say Franz died instantly and painlessly when questioned.

A student in Paul's class who is described as youthful and overweight. Behm was the only student that was not quickly influenced by Kantorek's patriotism to join the war, but eventually, due to pressure from friends and Kantorek, he joins the war. He is the first of Paul's friends to die. He is blinded in <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> and believed to be dead by his friends. The next day, when he is seen walking blindly around <a href="no-man%27s-land">no-man's-land</a>, it is discovered that he was only unconscious. However, he is killed before he can be rescued.

From November 10 to December 9, 1928, "All Quiet on the Western Front" was published in serial form in <a href="Vossische%20Zeitung">Vossische Zeitung</a> magazine. It was released in book form the following year to smashing success, selling one and a half million copies that same year. Although publishers had worried that interest in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> had waned more than 10 years after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">armistice</a>, Remarque's realistic depiction of trench warfare from the perspective of young soldiers struck a chord with the war's survivors—soldiers and civilians alike—and provoked strong reactions, both positive and negative, around the world.

With "All Quiet on the Western Front", Remarque emerged as an eloquent spokesman for a generation that had been, in his own words, "destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells." Remarque's harshest critics, in turn, were his countrymen, many of whom felt the book denigrated the German war effort, and that Remarque had exaggerated the horrors of war to further his pacifist agenda. The strongest voices against Remarque came from the emerging <a href="Nazi%20Party">National Socialist Party</a> and its ideological allies. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power, "All Quiet on the Western Front" became one of the first <a href="degenerate%20art">degenerate books</a> to be publicly burnt; in 1930 screenings of the <a href="All%20Quiet%20on%20the%20Western%20Front%20%281930%20film%29">Academy Award-winning film based on the book</a> were met with Nazi-organized protests and mob attacks on both movie theatres and audience members.

However, objections to Remarque’s portrayal of the German army personnel during World War I were not limited to the Nazis. Dr. Karl Kroner () objected to Remarque’s depiction of the medical personnel as being inattentive, uncaring, or absent from frontline action. Dr. Kroner was specifically worried that the book would perpetuate German stereotypes abroad that had subsided since the First World War. He offered the following clarification: “People abroad will draw the following conclusions: if German doctors deal with their own fellow countrymen in this manner, what acts of inhumanity will they not perpetuate against helpless prisoners delivered up into their hands or against the populations of occupied territory?”

A fellow patient of Remarque’s in the military hospital in <a href="Duisburg">Duisburg</a> objected to the negative depictions of the nuns and patients, and of the general portrayal of soldiers: “There were soldiers to whom the protection of homeland, protection of house and homestead, protection of family were the highest objective, and to whom this will to protect their homeland gave the strength to endure any extremities.”

These criticisms suggest that perhaps experiences of the war and the personal reactions of individual soldiers to their experiences may be more diverse than Remarque portrays them; however, it is beyond question that Remarque gives voice to a side of the war and its experience that was overlooked or suppressed at the time. This perspective is crucial to understanding the true effects of World War I. The evidence can be seen in the lingering depression that Remarque and many of his friends and acquaintances were suffering a decade later.

In contrast, "All Quiet on the Western Front" was trumpeted by <a href="pacifists">pacifists</a> as an anti-war book. Remarque makes a point in the opening statement that the novel does not advocate any political position, but is merely an attempt to describe the experiences of the soldier.

The main artistic criticism was that it was a mediocre attempt to cash in on public sentiment. The enormous popularity the work received was a point of contention for some literary critics, who scoffed at the fact that such a simple work could be so earth-shattering. Much of this literary criticism came from <a href="Salomo%20Friedlaender">Salomo Friedlaender</a>, who wrote a book "Hat Erich Maria Remarque wirklich gelebt?" "Did Erich Maria Remarque really live?" (under pen name Mynona), which was, in its turn, criticized in: "Hat Mynona wirklich gelebt?" "Did Mynona really live?" by <a href="Kurt%20Tucholsky">Kurt Tucholsky</a>. Friedlaender’s criticism was mainly personal in nature—he attacked Remarque as being ego-centric and greedy. Remarque publicly stated that he wrote "All Quiet on the Western Front" for personal reasons, not for profit, as Friedlaender had charged. wrote a parody titled "Vor Troja nichts Neues" ("Compared to Troy, Nothing New") under the pseudonym "Emil Marius Requark".

In 1930, an American film of the novel was made, directed by <a href="Lewis%20Milestone">Lewis Milestone</a>; with a screenplay by <a href="Maxwell%20Anderson">Maxwell Anderson</a>, <a href="George%20Abbott">George Abbott</a>, <a href="Del%20Andrews">Del Andrews</a>, <a href="C.%20Gardner%20Sullivan">C.

It stars <a href="Louis%20Wolheim">Louis Wolheim</a>, <a href="Lew%20Ayres">Lew Ayres</a>, <a href="John%20Wray%20%28actor%29">John Wray</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Lucy">Arnold Lucy</a>, and <a href="Ben%20Alexander%20%28actor%29">Ben Alexander</a>.

The film won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a> in 1930 for its producer <a href="Carl%20Laemmle%20Jr.">Carl Laemmle Jr.</a>, the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Directing">Academy Award for Directing</a> for <a href="Lewis%20Milestone">Lewis Milestone</a>, and the Academy Award for Outstanding Production. It was the first all-talking non-musical film to win the Best Picture Oscar. It also received two further nominations: <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a>, for <a href="Arthur%20Edeson">Arthur Edeson</a>, and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Writing%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Writing Achievement</a> for Abbott, Anderson, and Andrews.

In 2016, it was confirmed that <a href="Roger%20Donaldson">Roger Donaldson</a> will direct a remake of "All Quiet on the Western Front" starring <a href="Travis%20Fimmel">Travis Fimmel</a> as Katczinsky.

In 1979, the film was remade for CBS television by <a href="Delbert%20Mann">Delbert Mann</a>, starring <a href="Richard%20Thomas%20%28actor%29">Richard Thomas</a> of "<a href="The%20Waltons">The Waltons</a>" as Paul Bäumer and <a href="Ernest%20Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a> as Kat. The movie was filmed in <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>.

<a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>'s album "<a href="Jump%20Up%21%20%28Elton%20John%20album%29">Jump Up!</a>" (1982) features the song, "<a href="All%20Quiet%20on%20the%20Western%20Front%20%28song%29">All Quiet on the Western Front</a>" (written by Elton and <a href="Bernie%20Taupin">Bernie Taupin</a>). The song is a sorrowful rendition of the novel's story ("It's gone all quiet on the Western Front / Male Angels sigh / ghosts in a flooded trench / As Germany dies").

<a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, during his Nobel Laureate lecture, cited this book as one that had a profound effect on this songwriting.

African Americans

African Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans) are an <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a> of <a href="Americans">Americans</a> with total or partial ancestry from any of the <a href="Black%20people">black</a> racial groups of Africa. The term may also be used to include only those individuals who are descended from <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">enslaved Africans</a>. As a compound adjective the term is usually hyphenated as <a href="wikt%3AAfrican-American">African-American</a>.

Black and African Americans constitute the third largest <a href="racial%20and%20ethnic%20group%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial and ethnic group in the United States</a> (after <a href="White%20Americans">White Americans</a> and <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic and Latino Americans</a>). Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States. On average, African Americans are of <a href="West%20Africa">West</a>/<a href="Central%20Africa">Central Africa</a>n and <a href="Europe">European</a> descent, and some also have <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> ancestry. According to US Census Bureau data, <a href="African%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">African immigrants</a> generally do not self-identify as African American. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities (~95%). Immigrants from some <a href="Afro-Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, <a href="Afro-Latin%20Americans">Central American</a> and <a href="Afro-Latin%20American">South American</a> nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term.

<a href="African-American%20history">African-American history</a> starts in the 16th century, with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as <a href="Slavery">slaves</a> to Spanish America, and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English <a href="Colony">colonies</a> in North America. After the founding of the United States, <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">black people continued to be enslaved</a>, with four million denied freedom from bondage prior to the Civil War. Due largely to notions of <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a>, they were treated as <a href="second-class%20citizen">second-class citizen</a>s. The <a href="Naturalization%20Act%20of%201790">Naturalization Act of 1790</a> limited U.S. citizenship to whites only, and only white men of property could vote. These circumstances were changed by <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>, development of the <a href="African-American%20culture">black community</a>, participation in the great <a href="Military%20history%20of%20African%20Americans">military conflicts of the United States</a>, the elimination of <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a>, and the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> which sought political and social freedom. In 2008, <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> became the first African American to be elected <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>.

The first African slaves arrived via <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Santo%20Domingo">Santo Domingo</a> to the <a href="San%20Miguel%20de%20Gualdape">San Miguel de Gualdape</a> colony (most likely located in the <a href="Winyah%20Bay">Winyah Bay</a> area of present-day <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>), founded by Spanish explorer <a href="Lucas%20V%C3%A1zquez%20de%20Ayll%C3%B3n">Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón</a> in 1526.

The ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a>. De Ayllón and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned. The settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>, whence they had come.

The first recorded Africans in <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a> (including most of the future United States) were "20 and odd negroes" who came to <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown</a>, Virginia via <a href="Old%20Point%20Comfort">Cape Comfort</a> in August 1619 as <a href="indentured%20servant">indentured servant</a>s. As English settlers died from harsh conditions, more and more Africans were brought to work as laborers.
Typically, young men or women would sign a <a href="Indenture">contract of indenture</a> in exchange for transportation to the New World. The landowner received 50 acres of land from the state (<a href="headright">headright</a>s) for each servant purchased (around £6 per person, equivalent to 9 months income in the 17th century) from a ship's captain.

An indentured servant (who could be white or black) would work for several years (usually four to seven) without wages. The status of indentured servants in early Virginia and Maryland was similar to slavery. Servants could be bought, sold, or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away. Unlike slaves, they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out, their children did not inherit their status, and on their release from contract they received "a year's provision of corn, double apparel, tools necessary", and a small cash payment called "freedom dues".

Africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom. They raised families, married other Africans and sometimes <a href="Interracial%20marriage">intermarried</a> with Native Americans or <a href="English%20American">English settlers</a>.
By the 1640s and 1650s, several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own. In 1640, the Virginia General Court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when they sentenced <a href="John%20Punch%20%28slave%29">John Punch</a>, a Negro, to lifetime servitude under his master Hugh Gwyn for running away.

One of Dutch African arrivals, <a href="Anthony%20Johnson%20%28American%20Colonial%29">Anthony Johnson</a>, would later own one of the first black "slaves", <a href="John%20Casor">John Casor</a>, resulting from the court ruling of a civil case.

The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century. The <a href="Dutch%20West%20India%20Company">Dutch West India Company</a> introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into <a href="New%20Amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> (present-day New York City). All the colony's slaves, however, were freed upon its surrender to the British.
<a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> was the first British colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641. In 1662 Virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women (who were of African descent and thus foreigners) took the status of the mother, rather than that of the father, as under English common law. This principle was called "<a href="partus%20sequitur%20ventrum">partus sequitur ventrum</a>".

By an act of 1699, the colony ordered all free blacks deported, virtually defining as slaves all people of African descent who remained in the colony. In 1670 the colonial assembly passed a law prohibiting free and baptized negroes (and Indians) from purchasing Christians (in this act meaning English or European whites) but allowing them to buy people "of their owne nation".

The earliest African-American congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the <a href="First%20Great%20Awakening">Great Awakening</a>. By 1775, Africans made up 20% of the population in the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">American colonies</a>, which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English.

During the 1770s, Africans, both enslaved and free, helped rebellious English colonists secure American Independence by defeating the British in the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>. Africans and Englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated.

Blacks played a role in both sides in the American Revolution. Activists in the Patriot cause included <a href="James%20Armistead">James Armistead</a>, <a href="Prince%20Whipple">Prince Whipple</a> and <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell%20%28American%20soldier%29">Oliver Cromwell</a>.

Slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the <a href="U.S.%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a> through provisions such as Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as the <a href="3/5%20compromise">3/5 compromise</a>. Slavery, which by then meant almost exclusively African Americans, was the most important political issue in the <a href="antebellum%20United%20States">antebellum United States</a>, leading to one crisis after another. Among these were the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a>, the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a>, the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act">Fugitive Slave Act</a>, and the <a href="Dred%20Scott%20decision">Dred Scott decision</a>.
Prior to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, eight serving presidents owned slaves, a practice protected by the U.S. Constitution. By 1860, there were 3.5 to 4.4 million enslaved blacks in the U.S. due to the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a>, and another 488,000–500,000 African Americans lived free (with legislated limits) across the country. With legislated limits imposed upon them in addition to "unconquerable prejudice" from whites according to <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, some blacks who weren't enslaved left the U.S. for <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a> in Africa. Liberia began as a settlement of the <a href="American%20Colonization%20Society">American Colonization Society</a> (ACS) in 1821, with the abolitionist members of the ACS believing blacks would face better chances for freedom and equality in Africa.

The slaves not only constituted a large investment, they produced America's most valuable product and export: <a href="King%20Cotton">cotton</a>. They not only helped build the <a href="U.S.%20Capitol">U.S. Capitol</a>, they built the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> and other <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a> buildings. (<a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> was a slave trading center.) Similar building projects existed in slaveholding states.

In 1863, during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> signed the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>. The proclamation declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were free. Advancing Union troops enforced the proclamation with Texas being the last state to be emancipated, in 1865.
Slavery in Union-held Confederate territory continued, at least on paper, until the passage of the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a> in 1865. Prior to the Civil War, only white men of property could vote, and the <a href="Naturalization%20Act%20of%201790">Naturalization Act of 1790</a> limited U.S. citizenship to whites only. The <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">14th Amendment</a> (1868) gave African-Americans citizenship, and the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">15th Amendment</a> (1870) gave African-American males the right to vote (only males could vote in the U.S. at the time).

African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves, as well as schools and community/civic associations, to have space away from white control or oversight. While the post-war Reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, that period ended in 1876. By the late 1890s, Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> and <a href="disfranchisement%20after%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">disenfranchisement</a>. Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with Jim Crow laws, with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat. For those places that were racially mixed, non whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with. Most African Americans obeyed the Jim Crow laws, in order to avoid <a href="ethnic%20violence">racially motivated violence</a>. To maintain self-esteem and dignity, African Americans such as <a href="Anthony%20Overton">Anthony Overton</a> and <a href="Mary%20McLeod%20Bethune">Mary McLeod Bethune</a> continued to build their own <a href="Historically%20black%20colleges%20and%20universities">schools</a>, <a href="Black%20church">churches</a>, banks, social clubs, and other businesses.

In the last decade of the 19th century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States, a period often referred to as the "<a href="nadir%20of%20American%20race%20relations">nadir of American race relations</a>". These discriminatory acts included <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a>—upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in "<a href="Plessy%20v.%20Ferguson">Plessy v. Ferguson</a>" in 1896—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government, voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities.

The desperate conditions of African Americans in the South sparked the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a> of the early 20th century which led to a growing African-American community in the <a href="Northern%20United%20States">Northern United States</a>. The rapid influx of blacks disturbed the racial balance within Northern cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and white Northerners. Urban riots—whites attacking blacks—became a northern problem. The <a href="Red%20Summer">Red Summer</a> of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of race riots that occurred in more than three dozen cities, such as the <a href="Chicago%20race%20riot%20of%201919">Chicago race riot of 1919</a> and the <a href="Omaha%20race%20riot%20of%201919">Omaha race riot of 1919</a>. Overall, blacks in Northern cities experienced <a href="Racism%20in%20the%20United%20States">systemic discrimination</a> in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of "targeted violence, restrictive covenants, <a href="redlining">redlining</a> and racial steering". While many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics toward African Americans, many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions, a process known as <a href="white%20flight">white flight</a>.
By the 1950s, the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> was gaining momentum. A 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of <a href="Emmett%20Till">Emmett Till</a>, a 14-year-old boy from Chicago. Spending the summer with relatives in <a href="Money%2C%20Mississippi">Money, Mississippi</a>, Till was killed for allegedly having <a href="wolf-whistle">wolf-whistle</a>d at a white woman. Till had been badly beaten, one of his eyes was gouged out, and he was shot in the head. The visceral response to his mother's decision to have an open-casket funeral mobilized the black community throughout the U.S. Vann R. Newkirk| wrote "the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a>". The state of Mississippi tried two defendants, but they were speedily acquitted by an <a href="all-white%20jury">all-white jury</a>. One hundred days after Emmett Till's murder, <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a> refused to give up her seat on the bus in Alabama—indeed, Parks told Emmett's mother <a href="Mamie%20Till">Mamie Till</a> that "the photograph of Emmett’s disfigured face in the casket was set in her mind when she refused to give up her seat on the Montgomery bus." 

The <a href="March%20on%20Washington%20for%20Jobs%20and%20Freedom">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on Presidents <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>. Johnson put his support behind passage of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and <a href="Trade%20union">labor unions</a>, and the <a href="Voting%20Rights%20Act">Voting Rights Act</a> of 1965, which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections. By 1966, the emergence of the <a href="Black%20Power">Black Power</a> movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority.

During the postwar period, many African Americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other Americans. Average black income stood at 54 percent of that of white workers in 1947, and 55 percent in 1962. In 1959, median family income for whites was $5,600, compared with $2,900 for nonwhite families. In 1965, 43 percent of all black families fell into the poverty bracket, earning under $3,000 a year. The Sixties saw improvements in the social and economic conditions of many black Americans.

From 1965 to 1969, black family income rose from 54 to 60 percent of white family income. In 1968, 23 percent of black families earned under $3,000 a year, compared with 41 percent in 1960. In 1965, 19 percent of black Americans had incomes equal to the national median, a proportion that rose to 27 percent by 1967. In 1960, the median level of education for blacks had been 10.8 years, and by the late Sixties the figure rose to 12.2 years, half a year behind the median for whites.

Politically and economically, African Americans have made substantial strides during the post-civil rights era. In 1989, <a href="Douglas%20Wilder">Douglas Wilder</a> became the first African American elected governor in U.S. history. <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> became the second African-American Supreme Court Justice. In 1992 <a href="Carol%20Moseley-Braun">Carol Moseley-Braun</a> of <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> became the first African-American woman elected to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>. There were 8,936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 black mayors.

In 2005, the number of Africans immigrating to the United States, in a single year, surpassed the peak number who were involuntarily brought to the United States during the <a href="Atlantic%20Slave%20Trade">Atlantic Slave Trade</a>. On November 4, 2008, <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> <a href="United%20States%20Senator">Senator</a> <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">defeated</a> <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> Senator <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a> to become the first African American to be elected President. At least 95 percent of African-American voters voted for Obama. He also received overwhelming support from young and educated whites, a majority of <a href="Asian%20Americans">Asians</a>, <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanics</a>, and <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> picking up a number of new states in the Democratic electoral column. Obama lost the overall white vote, although he won a larger proportion of white votes than any previous nonincumbent Democratic presidential candidate since <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. Obama was <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">reelected</a> for a second and <a href="term%20limit">final term</a>, by a similar margin on November 6, 2012.

In 1790, when the first <a href="United%20States%20Census">U.S. Census</a> was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, the African-American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country. The vast majority were slaves, with only 488,000 counted as "<a href="Freedman">freemen</a>". By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.

In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the South. Large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions, and to escape <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a> and racial violence. The <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a>, as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million <a href="black%20people">black people</a> moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, <a href="New%20Great%20Migration">that trend reversed</a>, with more African Americans moving south to the <a href="Sun%20Belt">Sun Belt</a> than leaving it.

The following table of the African-American population in the United States over time shows that the African-American population, as a percentage of the total population, declined until 1930 and has been rising since then.
By 1990, the African-American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.

At the time of the <a href="United%20States%20Census%202000">2000 Census</a>, 54.8% of African Americans lived in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>. In that year, 17.6% of African Americans lived in the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeast</a> and 18.7% in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>, while only 8.9% lived in the <a href="Western%20United%20States">western</a> states. The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas, however. California, the nation's most populous state, has the fifth largest African-American population, only behind New York, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of <a href="Black%20Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin</a>, many of whom may be of <a href="Afro-Brazilian">Brazilian</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20people">Puerto Rican</a>, <a href="Dominican%20American">Dominican</a>, <a href="Afro-Cuban">Cuban</a>, <a href="Haitian%20Americans">Haitian</a>, or other <a href="Afro-Latin%20American">Latin American</a> descent. The only self-reported "ancestral" groups larger than African Americans are the <a href="Irish%20American">Irish</a> and <a href="German%20Americans">Germans</a>. Because many African Americans trace their ancestry to colonial American origins, some simply self-identify as "<a href="American%20ethnicity">American</a>".

According to the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 US Census</a>, nearly 3% of people who self-identified as black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country. Self-reported <a href="West%20Indian%20American">non-Hispanic black immigrants from the Caribbean</a>, mostly from Jamaica and Haiti, represented 0.9% of the US population, at 2.6 million. Self-reported black immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also represented 0.9%, at about 2.8 million. Additionally, self-identified <a href="Black%20Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Black Hispanics</a> represented 0.4% of the United States population, at about 1.2 million people, largely found within the Puerto Rican and Dominican communities. Self-reported black immigrants hailing from other countries in the Americas, such as Brazil and Canada, as well as several European countries, represented less than 0.1% of the population. Mixed-Race Hispanic and non-Hispanic Americans who identified as being part black, represented 0.9% of the population. Of the 12.6% of United States residents who identified as black, around 10.3% were "native black American" or ethnic African Americans, who are direct descendants of West/Central Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves. These individuals make up well over 80% of all blacks in the country. When including <a href="Multiracial%20American">people of mixed-race origin</a>, about 13.5% of the US population self-identified as black or "mixed with black". However, according to the U.S. census bureau, evidence from the 2000 Census indicates that many African and Caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as "Black, African Am., or Negro". Instead, they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the "Some Other Race" write-in entry. As a result, the census bureau devised a new, separate "African American" ethnic group category in 2010 for ethnic African Americans. Following lobbying led by the <a href="Arab%20American%20Institute">Arab American Institute</a>, a national organization representing <a href="Arab%20Americans">Arab Americans</a>, the census bureau also announced in 2014 that it may establish an additional new ethnic category for populations from the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> and the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a>.

Almost 58% of African Americans lived in <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a>s in 2000. With over 2 million black residents, <a href="New%20York%20City%2C%20New%20York">New York City</a> had the largest black urban population in the United States in 2000, overall the city has a 28% black population. <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago</a> has the second largest black population, with almost 1.6 million African Americans in its metropolitan area, representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population.

After 100 years of African-Americans leaving the south in large numbers seeking better opportunities in the west and north, a movement known as the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a>, there is now a reverse trend, called the <a href="New%20Great%20Migration">New Great Migration</a>. A growing percentage of African-Americans from the west and north are migrating to the southern region of the U.S. for economic and cultural reasons. New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles have the highest decline in African Americans, while Atlanta, <a href="Dallas%2CTexas">Dallas</a>, and <a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston</a> have the highest increase respectively.

Among cities of 100,000 or more, <a href="Detroit">Detroit, Michigan</a> had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2010, with 82%. Other large cities with African-American majorities include <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a> (79.4%), <a href="Miami%20Gardens%2C%20Florida">Miami Gardens, Florida</a> (76.3%), <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore, Maryland</a> (63%), <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a> (62.5%), <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a> (61%), <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans, Louisiana</a> (60%), <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a> (56.6%), <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint, Michigan</a> (56.6%), <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a> (55.0%), <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a> (54.7%), <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta, Georgia</a> (54%, see <a href="African%20Americans%20in%20Atlanta">African Americans in Atlanta</a>), <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a> (53.3%), <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a> (52.35%), <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> (50.7%), <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> (50.6%), <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a> (50.6%), <a href="Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana">Baton Rouge, Louisiana</a> (50.4%), and <a href="Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</a> (50.4%).

The nation's most affluent community with an African-American majority resides in <a href="View%20Park%E2%80%93Windsor%20Hills%2C%20California">View Park–Windsor Hills, California</a> with an annual median income of $159,618. Other largely affluent predominately African-American communities include <a href="Prince%20George%27s%20County%2C%20Maryland">Prince George's County</a> in Maryland (namely <a href="Mitchellville%2C%20Maryland">Mitchellville</a>, <a href="Woodmore%2C%20Maryland">Woodmore</a>, and <a href="Upper%20Marlboro%2C%20Maryland">Upper Marlboro</a>), <a href="DeKalb%20County%2C%20Georgia">Dekalb County</a> in Georgia, <a href="Charles%20City%20County%2C%20Virginia">Charles City County</a> in Virginia, <a href="Baldwin%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Baldwin Hills</a> in California, <a href="Hillcrest%2C%20Rockland%20County%2C%20New%20York">Hillcrest</a> and <a href="Uniondale%2C%20New%20York">Uniondale</a> in New York, and <a href="Cedar%20Hill%2C%20Texas">Cedar Hill</a>, <a href="DeSoto%2C%20Texas">DeSoto</a>, and <a href="Missouri%20City%2C%20Texas">Missouri City</a> in Texas. <a href="Queens">Queens County, New York</a> is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans.

<a href="Seatack%2C%20Virginia">Seatack, Virginia</a> is currently the oldest African-American community in the United States. It survives today with a vibrant and active civic community.

By 2012, African Americans had advanced greatly in education attainment. They still lagged overall compared to white or Asian Americans but surpassed other ethnic minorities, with 19 percent earning bachelor's degrees and 6 percent earning advanced degrees. Between 1995 and 2009, freshmen college enrollment for African Americans increased by 73 percent and only 15 percent for whites. Black women are enrolled in college more than any other race and gender group, leading all with 9.7% enrolled according to the 2011 U.S. Census Bureau. Predominantly <a href="black%20school">black school</a>s for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the U.S. before the 1970s. By 1972, however, desegregation efforts meant that only 25% of Black students were in schools with more than 90% non-white students. However, since then, a trend towards re-segregation affected communities across the country: by 2011, 2.9 million African-American students were in such overwhelmingly minority schools, including 53% of Black students in school districts that were formerly under desegregation orders.

<a href="Historically%20black%20colleges%20and%20universities">Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)</a>, which were originally set up when segregated colleges did not admit African Americans, continue to thrive and educate students of all races today. The majority of HBCUs were established in the <a href="southeastern%20United%20States">southeastern United States</a>, <a href="List%20of%20colleges%20and%20universities%20in%20Alabama">Alabama</a> has the most HBCUs of any state.

As late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. By 1969, <a href="illiteracy">illiteracy</a> as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans.

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed a high-school education, less than whites or Asians, but more than Hispanics. On many college entrance, standardized tests and grades, African Americans have historically lagged behind whites, but some studies suggest that the <a href="Achievement%20gap%20in%20the%20United%20States">achievement gap</a> has been closing. Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a>, desegregation, and multiculturalism.

The average high school graduation rate of blacks in the United States has steadily increased to 71% in 2013. Separating this statistic into component parts shows it varies greatly depending upon the state and the school district examined. 38% of black males graduated in the state of New York but in Maine 97% graduated and exceeded the white male graduation rate by 11 percentage points. In much of the southeastern United States and some parts of the southwestern United States the graduation rate of white males was in fact below 70% such as in Florida where a 62% of white males graduated high school. Examining specific school districts paints an even more complex picture. In the Detroit school district the graduation rate of black males was 20% but 7% for white males. In the New York City school district 28% of black males graduate high school compared to 57% of white males. In Newark County 76% of black males graduated compared to 67% for white males. Further academic improvement has occurred in 2015. Roughly 23% of all blacks have bachelor's degrees. In 1988, 21% of whites had obtained a bachelor's degree versus 11% of blacks. In 2015, 23% of blacks had obtained a bachelor's degree versus 36% of whites. Foreign born blacks, 9% of the black population, made even greater strides. They exceed native born blacks by 10 percentage points.
In Chicago, <a href="Marva%20Collins">Marva Collins</a>, an African-American educator, created a low cost private school specifically for the purpose of teaching low-income African-American children whom the public school system had labeled as being "<a href="learning%20disabled">learning disabled</a>". One article about Marva Collins' school stated,
Working with students having the worst of backgrounds, those who were working far below grade level, and even those who had been labeled as 'unteachable,' Marva was able to overcome the obstacles. News of third grade students reading at ninth grade level, four-year-olds learning to read in only a few months, outstanding test scores, disappearance of behavioral problems, second-graders studying Shakespeare, and other incredible reports, astounded the public. During the 2006–2007 school year, Collins' school charged $5,500 for tuition, and parents said that the school did a much better job than the Chicago public school system. Meanwhile, during the 2007–2008 year, Chicago public school officials claimed that their budget of $11,300 per student was not enough.

Economically, African Americans have benefited from the advances made during the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights era</a>, particularly among the educated, but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalization when considered as a whole. The <a href="Racial%20inequality%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial disparity in poverty rates</a> has narrowed. The black middle class has grown substantially. In 2010, 45% of African Americans owned their homes, compared to 67% of all Americans. The <a href="African-American%20poverty">poverty rate among African Americans</a> has decreased from 26.5% in 1998 to 24.7% in 2004, compared to 12.7% for all Americans.

African Americans have a combined buying power of over $892 billion currently and likely over $1.1 trillion by 2012. In 2002, African American-owned businesses accounted for 1.2 million of the US's 23 million businesses. African American-owned businesses account for approximately 2 million <a href="US%20businesses">US businesses</a>. Black-owned businesses experienced the largest growth in number of businesses among minorities from 2002 to 2011.

In 2004, African-American men had the third-highest earnings of American <a href="minority%20group">minority group</a>s after Asian Americans and non-Hispanic whites.

Twenty-five percent of blacks had <a href="white-collar%20worker">white-collar</a> occupations (management, professional, and related fields) in 2000, compared with 33.6% of Americans overall. In 2001, over half of African-American households of married couples earned $50,000 or more. Although in the same year African Americans were over-represented among the nation's poor, this was directly related to the disproportionate percentage of African-American families headed by single women; such families are collectively poorer, regardless of ethnicity.

In 2006, the median earnings of African-American men was more than black and non-black American women overall, and in all educational levels. At the same time, among American men, income disparities were significant; the median income of African-American men was approximately 76 cents for every dollar of their European American counterparts, although the gap narrowed somewhat with a rise in educational level.

Overall, the median earnings of African-American men were 72 cents for every dollar earned of their Asian American counterparts, and $1.17 for every dollar earned by Hispanic men. On the other hand, by 2006, among American women with post-secondary education, African-American women have made significant advances; the median income of African-American women was more than those of their Asian-, European- and Hispanic American counterparts with at least some college education.

The US <a href="public%20sector">public sector</a> is the single most important source of employment for African Americans. During 2008–2010, 21.2% of all Black workers were public employees, compared with 16.3% of non-Black workers. Both before and after the onset of the <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a>, African Americans were 30% more likely than other workers to be employed in the public sector.

The public sector is also a critical source of decent-paying jobs for Black Americans. For both men and women, the median wage earned by Black employees is significantly higher in the public sector than in other industries.

In 1999, the median income of African-American families was $33,255 compared to $53,356 of European Americans. In times of economic hardship for the nation, African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and <a href="underemployment">underemployment</a>, with the black underclass being hardest hit. The phrase "last hired and first fired" is reflected in the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> unemployment figures. Nationwide, the October 2008 unemployment rate for African Americans was 11.1%, while the nationwide rate was 6.5%.

The income gap between black and white families is also significant. In 2005, employed blacks earned 65% of the wages of whites, down from 82% in 1975. "The New York Times" reported in 2006 that in <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, New York, the median income among African-American families exceeded that of white families, which the newspaper attributed to the growth in the number of two-parent black families. It noted that Queens was the only county with more than 65,000 residents where that was true.

In 2011, it was reported that <a href="African-American%20family%20structure">72% of black babies were born to unwed mothers</a>. The poverty rate among single-parent black families was 39.5% in 2005, according to Williams, while it was 9.9% among married-couple black families. Among white families, the respective rates were 26.4% and 6% in poverty.

The life expectancy for Black men in 2008 was 70.8 years. Life expectancy for Black women was 77.5 years in 2008. In 1900, when information on Black life expectancy started being collated, a Black man could expect to live to 32.5 years and a Black woman 33.5 years. In 1900, White men lived an average of 46.3 years and White women lived an average of 48.3 years. African-American life expectancy at birth is persistently five to seven years lower than <a href="European%20Americans">European Americans</a>.

Black people have higher rates of obesity, diabetes and <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a> than the US average. For adult Black men, the rate of obesity was 31.6% in 2010. For adult Black women, the rate of obesity was 41.2% in 2010. African Americans have higher rates of mortality than does any other racial or ethnic group for 8 of the top 10 causes of death. In 2013, among men, black men had the highest rate of getting cancer, followed by white, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI), and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) men. Among women, white women had the highest rate of getting cancer, followed by black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women.
Violence has an impact upon African-American life expectancy. A report from the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a> states "In 2005, homicide victimization rates for blacks were 6 times higher than the rates for whites". The report also found that "94% of black victims were killed by blacks."

<a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> is one of the top three causes of death for African-American men aged 25–54 and for African-American women aged 35–44 years. In the United States, African Americans make up about 48% of the total HIV-positive population and make up more than half of new HIV cases. The main route of transmission for women is through unprotected heterosexual sex. African-American women are 19 times more likely to contract HIV than other women.

Washington, D.C. has the nation's highest rate of HIV/AIDS infection, at 3%. This rate is comparable to what is seen in West Africa, and is considered a severe epidemic. Dr. Ray Martins, Chief Medical Officer at the Whitman-Walker Clinic, the largest provider of HIV care in Washington D.C., estimated that the actual underlying percent with HIV/AIDS in the city is "closer to five percent".

According to a Gallup survey conducted from June to September 2012, 4.6 percent of Black or African Americans self identify as <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a>; this is greater than the estimated 3.4 percent of American adults that self identify as LGBT in the total population.

The majority of African Americans are <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>, many of whom follow the historically black churches. The term Black church refers to churches which minister to predominantly African-American congregations. Black congregations were first established by freed slaves at the end of the 17th century, and later when slavery was abolished more African Americans were allowed to create a unique form of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> that was culturally influenced by African spiritual traditions.

According to a 2007 survey, more than half of the African-American population are part of the historically black churches. The largest Protestant denomination among African Americans are the <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a>, distributed mainly in four denominations, the largest being the <a href="National%20Baptist%20Convention%2C%20USA%2C%20Inc.">National Baptist Convention, USA</a> and the <a href="National%20Baptist%20Convention%20of%20America%2C%20Inc.">National Baptist Convention of America</a>. The second largest are the <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>s, the largest denominations are the <a href="African%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">African Methodist Episcopal Church</a> and the <a href="African%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Zion%20Church">African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church</a>.

<a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostals</a> are distributed among several different religious bodies, with the <a href="Church%20of%20God%20in%20Christ">Church of God in Christ</a> as the largest among them by far. About 16% of African-American Christians are members of white Protestant communions, these denominations (which include the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Christ">United Church of Christ</a>) mostly have a 2 to 3% African-American membership. There are also large numbers of <a href="Roman%20Catholics">Roman Catholics</a>, constituting 5% of the African-American population. Of the total number of <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, 22% are black.

Some African Americans follow <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. Historically, between 15 and 30% of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas were <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s, but most of these Africans were converted to Christianity during the era of American slavery. During the twentieth century, some African Americans converted to Islam, mainly through the influence of <a href="Black%20nationalism">black nationalist</a> groups that preached with distinctive Islamic practices; including the <a href="Moorish%20Science%20Temple%20of%20America">Moorish Science Temple of America</a>, and the largest organization, the <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation of Islam</a>, founded in the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963, prominent members included activist <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> and boxer <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>.

Malcolm X is considered the first person to start the movement among African Americans towards mainstream Islam, after he left the Nation and made the <a href="Hajj">pilgrimage to Mecca</a>. In 1975, <a href="Warith%20Deen%20Mohammed">Warith Deen Mohammed</a>, the son of <a href="Elijah%20Muhammad">Elijah Muhammad</a> took control of the Nation after his father's death and guided the majority of its members to <a href="Sunni%20Islam">orthodox Islam</a>. However, a few members rejected these changes, in particular <a href="Louis%20Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a>, who revived the Nation of Islam in 1978 based on its original teachings.

<a href="African-American%20Muslims">African-American Muslims</a> constitute 20% of the total <a href="Islam%20in%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Muslim population</a>, the majority are <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> or orthodox Muslims, some of these identify under the community of <a href="W.%20Deen%20Mohammed">W. Deen Mohammed</a>. The Nation of Islam led by Louis Farrakhan has a membership ranging from 20,000–50,000 members.

There are relatively few African-American <a href="Jews">Jews</a>; estimates of their number range from 20,000 to 200,000. Most of these Jews are part of mainstream groups such as the <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a>, <a href="Conservative%20Judaism">Conservative</a>, or <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a> branches of <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>; although there are significant numbers of people who are part of non-mainstream Jewish groups, largely the <a href="Black%20Hebrew%20Israelites">Black Hebrew Israelites</a>, whose beliefs include the claim that African Americans are descended from the Biblical <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a>.

Confirmed <a href="Atheism">atheists</a> are less than one half of one-percent, similar to numbers for <a href="Hispanic">Hispanic</a>s.

African Americans have a long and diverse history of <a href="African-American%20Businesses">business ownership</a>. Although the first <a href="African-American%20Businesses">African-American business</a> is unknown, slaves captured from West Africa are believed to have established commercial enterprises as peddlers and skilled craftspeople as far back as the 17th century. Around 1900, Booker T. Washington became the most famous proponent of African American businesses. His critic and rival W.E.B. DuBois also commended business as a vehicle for African American advancement.

<a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">African American Vernacular English</a> (AAVE) is a <a href="Variety%20%28linguistics%29">variety</a> (<a href="dialect">dialect</a>, <a href="ethnolect">ethnolect</a>, and <a href="sociolect">sociolect</a>) of <a href="American%20English">American English</a>, commonly spoken by urban <a href="working%20class">working-class</a> and largely <a href="wiktionary%3Abidialectal">bi-dialectal</a> <a href="middle%20class">middle-class</a> African Americans. Non-linguists sometimes call it "<a href="Ebonics%20%28word%29">Ebonics</a>" (a term that also has other meanings and connotations).

African American Vernacular English evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of 16th and 17th century English of Great Britain and Ireland and various West African languages. As a result, the variety shares parts of its <a href="grammar">grammar</a> and <a href="phonology">phonology</a> with the <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern American English</a> dialect. Where African American Vernacular English differs from Standard American English (SAE) is in certain pronunciation characteristics, tense usage and grammatical structures that were derived from West African languages, particularly those belonging to the <a href="Niger-Congo%20languages">Niger-Congo</a> family.

Virtually all habitual speakers of African American Vernacular English can understand and communicate in Standard American English. As with all linguistic forms, AAVE's usage is influenced by various factors, including geographical, educational and socioeconomic background, as well as formality of setting. Additionally, there are many literary uses of this variety of English, particularly in <a href="African-American%20literature">African-American literature</a>.

Some of the new words used by the people include "fleek" which means on point and "throwing shade" which means offending someone.

Recent surveys of African Americans using a genetic testing service have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors. These studies found that on average, African Americans have 73.2-82.1% <a href="West%20African%20people">West African</a>, 16.7%-24% <a href="Europe">European</a>, and 0.8–1.2% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> genetic ancestry, with large variation between individuals. Genetics websites themselves have reported similar ranges, with some finding 1 or 2 percent Native American ancestry and <a href="Ancestry.com">Ancestry.com</a> reporting an outlying percentage of European ancestry among African Americans, 29%.

According to a genome-wide study by Bryc et al. (2009), the overall ancestry of African Americans was formed through historic admixture between West/Central Africans (more frequently females) and Europeans (more frequently males). Consequently, the 365 African Americans in their sample have a genome-wide average of 78.1% West African ancestry and 18.5% European ancestry, with large variation among individuals (ranging from 99% to 1% West African ancestry). The West African ancestral component in African Americans is most similar to that in present-day speakers from the non-<a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu</a> branches of the <a href="Niger-Congo%20languages">Niger-Congo</a> (Niger-Kordofanian) family.

Correspondingly, Montinaro et al. (2014) observed that around 50% of the overall ancestry of African Americans traces back to the Niger-Congo-speaking <a href="Yoruba%20people">Yoruba</a> of southwestern <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and southern <a href="Benin">Benin</a>, reflecting the centrality of this West Africa region in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The next most frequent ancestral component found among African Americans was derived from <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, in keeping with historical records. It constitutes a little over 10% of their overall ancestry, and is most similar to the Northwest European ancestral component also carried by <a href="Barbadians">Barbadians</a>. Zakharaia et al. (2009) found a similar proportion of Yoruba associated ancestry in their African-American samples, with a minority also drawn from <a href="Mandenka%20people">Mandenka</a> and <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu</a> populations. Additionally, the researchers observed an average European ancestry of 21.9%, again with significant variation between individuals. Bryc et al. (2009) note that populations from other parts of the continent may also constitute adequate proxies for the ancestors of some African-American individuals; namely, ancestral populations from Guinea Bissau, Senegal and Sierra Leone in West Africa and Angola in Southern Africa.

Altogether, genetic studies suggest that African Americans are a multiracial people. According to DNA analysis led in 2006 by <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Penn State</a> geneticist <a href="Mark%20D.%20Shriver">Mark D. Shriver</a>, around 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent to one European great-grandparent and his/her forebears), 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent to one European grandparent and his/her forebears), and 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent to one European parent and his/her forebears). According to Shriver, around 5 percent of African Americans also have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one Native American great-grandparent and his/her forebears).

According to a <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y-DNA</a> study by Sims et al. (2007), the majority (~60%) of African Americans belong to various subclades of the <a href="Haplogroup%20E-V38">E3a</a> (E1b1a) paternal haplogroup. This is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among West/Central African males, and is also a signature of the historical <a href="Bantu%20migration">Bantu migration</a>s. The next most frequent Y-DNA haplogroup observed among African Americans is the <a href="Haplogroup%20R1b%20%28Y-DNA%29">R1b</a> clade, which around 15% of African Americans carry. This lineage is most common today among Northwestern European males. The remaining African Americans mainly belong to the paternal <a href="Haplogroup%20I-M170">haplogroup I</a> (~7%), which is also frequent in Northwestern Europe.

According to an <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mtDNA</a> study by Salas et al. (2005), the maternal lineages of African Americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in West Africa (>55%), followed closely by West-Central Africa and Southwestern Africa (<41%). The characteristic West African haplogroups <a href="Haplogroup%20L1%20%28mtDNA%29">L1b</a>, <a href="Haplogroup%20L2%20%28mtDNA%29">L2b,c,d</a>, and <a href="Haplogroup%20L3%20%28mtDNA%29">L3b,d</a> and West-Central African haplogroups <a href="Haplogroup%20L1%20%28mtDNA%29">L1c</a> and <a href="Haplogroup%20L3%20%28mtDNA%29">L3e</a> in particular occur at high frequencies among African Americans. As with the paternal DNA of African Americans, contributions from other parts of the continent to their maternal gene pool are insignificant.

<a href="African-American%20names">African-American names</a> are part of the cultural traditions of African Americans. Prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture. Babies of that era were generally given a few common names, with children using <a href="nickname">nickname</a>s to distinguish the various people with the same name. With the rise of 1960s civil rights movement, there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins.

By the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common among African Americans to invent new names for themselves, although many of these invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re and Ja/Je, and suffixes like -ique/iqua, -isha and -aun/-awn are common, as are inventive spellings for common names. The book "Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool--The Very Last Word on First Names" places the origins of "La" names in African-American culture in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>.

Even with the rise of inventive names, it is still common for African Americans to use biblical, historical, or traditional European names. Daniel, Christopher, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew were thus among the most frequent names for African-American boys in 2013.

The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin, but has elements of it that were drawn from both French and West/Central African roots. Other names like LaTanisha, JaMarcus, DeAndre, and Shaniqua were created in the same way. Punctuation marks are seen more often within African-American names than other American names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre.

African Americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the Civil Rights Movement and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African -middle class across the United States. Unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of American government has been gained by African Americans in the post-civil rights era.

One of the most serious and long-standing issues within African-American communities is <a href="poverty">poverty</a>. Poverty is associated with higher rates of marital stress and dissolution, <a href="physical%20disorder">physical</a> and <a href="mental%20disorder">mental health</a> problems, <a href="disability%20and%20poverty">disability</a>, <a href="cognitive%20deficit">cognitive deficit</a>s, <a href="Achievement%20gap%20in%20the%20United%20States">low educational attainment</a>, and crime. In 2004, almost 25% of African-American families lived below the poverty level. In 2007, the average income for African Americans was approximately $34,000, compared to $55,000 for whites. Forty percent of prison inmates are African American. African Americans experience a higher rate of <a href="unemployment">unemployment</a> than the general population. African American males are more likely to be killed by police. This is one of the factors that led to the creation of the <a href="Black%20Lives%20Matter">Black Lives Matter</a> movement.

Collectively, African Americans are more involved in the American political process than other minority groups in the United States, indicated by the highest level of voter registration and participation in elections among these groups in 2004. African Americans collectively attain higher levels of education than immigrants to the United States. African Americans also have the highest level of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congressional representation</a> of any minority group in the U.S.

A large majority of African Americans support the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 Presidential Election</a>, Democrat <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a> received 88% of the African-American vote compared to 11% for <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Although there is an <a href="African-American%20lobby%20in%20foreign%20policy">African-American lobby in foreign policy</a>, it has not had the impact that African-American organizations have had in domestic policy.

Many African Americans were excluded from electoral politics in the decades following the end of Reconstruction. For those that could participate, until the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>, African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves; at the time, the Republicans and Democrats represented the <a href="sectionalism">sectional</a> interests of the <a href="Northern%20United%20States">North</a> and <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>, respectively, rather than any specific ideology, and both <a href="right-wing%20politics">right</a> and <a href="left-wing%20politics">left</a> were represented equally in both parties.

The African-American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, when <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> program provided economic relief to African Americans; Roosevelt's <a href="New%20Deal%20coalition">New Deal coalition</a> turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies, regardless of region. The African-American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s. In 1960, nearly a third of African Americans voted for Republican <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>.

After over 50 years, marriage rates for all Americans began to decline while divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have climbed. These changes have been greatest among African Americans. After more than 70 years of racial parity black marriage rates began to fall behind whites. Single-parent households have become common, and according to US census figures released in January 2010, only 38 percent of black children live with both their parents.

In 2008, Democrats overwhelmingly voted 70% against <a href="California%20Proposition%208">California Proposition 8</a>, African Americans voted 58% in favor of it while 42% voted against Proposition 8. On May 9, 2012, Barack Obama, the first black president, became the first US president to support same-sex marriage. After Obama's endorsement there is a rapid growth in support for same-sex marriage among African Americans. Now 59% of African Americans support same-sex marriage, which is higher than support among the national average (53%) and <a href="white%20Americans">white Americans</a> (50%).

Polls in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> have also shown an increase in support for same sex marriage among African Americans. On November 6, 2012, <a href="Maryland%20Question%206">Maryland</a>, <a href="Maine%20Question%201%2C%202012">Maine</a>, and <a href="Washington%20Referendum%2074">Washington</a> all voted for approve of same-sex marriage, along with Minnesota rejecting a <a href="Minnesota%20Amendment%201">constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage</a>. Exit polls in Maryland show about 50% of African Americans voted for same-sex marriage, showing a vast evolution among African Americans on the issue and was crucial in helping pass same-sex marriage in Maryland.

Blacks hold far more conservative opinions on abortion, <a href="Affair">extramarital sex</a>, and raising children out of wedlock than Democrats as a whole. On financial issues, however, African Americans are in line with Democrats, generally supporting a more <a href="progressive%20tax">progressive tax</a> structure to provide more government spending on social services.

<a href="Military%20history%20of%20African%20Americans">African Americans have fought in every war</a> in the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States">history of the United States</a>.

The gains made by African Americans in the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> and in the <a href="Black%20Power%20movement">Black Power movement</a> not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways. Prior to the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination, or <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a>. They were often the victims of extreme cruelty and violence, sometimes resulting in deaths: by the post World War II era, African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality. In the words of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to "rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal ..."

The Civil Rights Movement marked an enormous change in American social, political, economic and civic life. It brought with it <a href="boycott">boycott</a>s, <a href="sit-in">sit-in</a>s, <a href="nonviolent">nonviolent</a> demonstrations and marches, court battles, bombings and other violence; prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate; forged enduring civic, economic and religious alliances; and disrupted and realigned the nation's two major political parties.

Over time, it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another. The movement resulted in the removal of codified, "de jure" racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the <a href="Free%20Speech%20Movement">Free Speech Movement</a>, the <a href="Disability">disabled</a>, the <a href="Feminist%20movement">women's movement</a>, <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, and <a href="migrant%20workers">migrant workers</a>.

Some activists and academics contend that news media coverage of African-American news concerns or dilemmas is inadequate or the news media present distorted images of African Americans. To combat this, <a href="Robert%20L.%20Johnson">Robert L. Johnson</a> founded <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">Black Entertainment Television</a>, a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States. Most programming on the network consists of <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">rap</a> and <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> music videos and urban-oriented movies and series. The channel also shows syndicated television series, original programs, and some public affairs programs. On Sunday mornings, BET broadcasts a lineup of network-produced Christian programming; other, non-affiliated Christian programs are also shown during the early morning hours daily. BET is now a global network that reaches 90 million households in the United States, Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

In addition to BET there is <a href="BET%20Her">BET Her</a>, which is a spin-off cable television channel of BET, created originally as "BET on Jazz" to showcase <a href="jazz">jazz</a> music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians. Programming has been expanded to include a block of urban programs as well as some R&B, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>, and <a href="world%20music">world music</a>.

<a href="TV%20One%20%28Radio%20One%29">TV One</a> is another African-American-oriented network and a direct competitor to BET, targeting African-American adults with a broad range of programming. The network airs original lifestyle and entertainment-oriented shows, movies, fashion and music programming, as well as classic series such as <a href="227%20%28TV%20series%29">227</a>, <a href="Good%20Times">Good Times</a>, <a href="Martin%20%28TV%20series%29">Martin</a>, <a href="Boston%20Public">Boston Public</a> and <a href="Showtime%20at%20the%20Apollo">It's Showtime at the Apollo</a>. The network primarily owned by <a href="Radio%20One%20%28company%29">Radio One</a>. Founded and controlled by <a href="Cathy%20Hughes">Catherine Hughes</a>, it is one of the nation's largest radio broadcasting companies and the largest African-American-owned radio broadcasting company in the United States.

Other African-American networks scheduled to launch in 2009 are the Black Television News Channel founded by former Congressman <a href="J.%20C.%20Watts">J. C. Watts</a> and <a href="Better%20Black%20Television">Better Black Television</a> founded by <a href="Master%20P">Percy Miller</a>. In June 2009, <a href="NBC%20News">NBC News</a> launched a new website named <a href="The%20Grio">The Grio</a> in partnership with the production team that created the black documentary film "<a href="Meeting%20David%20Wilson">Meeting David Wilson</a>". It is the first African-American video <a href="news%20site">news site</a> that focuses on underrepresented stories in existing national news. <a href="The%20Grio">The Grio</a> consists of a broad spectrum of original video packages, news articles, and contributor blogs on topics including breaking news, politics, health, business, entertainment and Black History.

From their earliest presence in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, African Americans have significantly contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, cuisine, clothing styles, music, language, and social and technological innovation to American culture. The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States, such as <a href="Sweet%20potato">yams</a>, <a href="peanut">peanut</a>s, <a href="rice">rice</a>, <a href="okra">okra</a>, <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="grits">grits</a>, <a href="watermelon">watermelon</a>, <a href="indigo%20dye">indigo dye</a>s, and <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, can be traced to West African and African-American influences. Notable examples include <a href="George%20Washington%20Carver">George Washington Carver</a>, who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 products from pecans; and <a href="George%20Crum">George Crum</a>, a local legend associates him with the creation of the potato chip in 1853. <a href="Soul%20food">Soul food</a> is a variety of cuisine popular among African Americans. It is closely related to the <a href="cuisine%20of%20the%20Southern%20United%20States">cuisine of the Southern United States</a>. The descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid-1960s, when "<a href="wikt%3Asoul">soul</a>" was a common definer used to describe African-American culture (for example, <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>). African Americans were the first peoples in the United States to make fried chicken, along with <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> immigrants to the South. Although the Scottish had been frying chicken before they emigrated, they lacked the spices and flavor that African Americans had used when preparing the meal. The Scottish American settlers therefore adopted the African-American method of seasoning chicken. However, fried chicken was generally a rare meal in the African-American community, and was usually reserved for special events or celebrations.

<a href="African-American%20music">African-American music</a> is one of the most pervasive African-American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music. <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">Hip hop</a>, <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a>, <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>, <a href="blues">blues</a>, and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music, including <a href="blues">blues</a>, <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a>, <a href="Barbershop%20music">barbershop</a>, <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a>, <a href="Bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a>, <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, and <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a>.

African-American-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> genre in the world, including <a href="Country%20music">country</a> and <a href="techno">techno</a>. African-American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.

African Americans have also had an important role in American dance. <a href="Bill%20T.%20Jones">Bill T. Jones</a>, a prominent modern choreographer and dancer, has included historical African-American themes in his work, particularly in the piece "Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land". Likewise, <a href="Alvin%20Ailey">Alvin Ailey</a>'s artistic work, including his "Revelations" based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s, has had a significant influence on modern dance. Another form of dance, <a href="Stepping%20%28African-American%29">Stepping</a>, is an African-American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.

Many African-American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans. <a href="African-American%20literature">African-American literature</a> is a major genre in American literature. Famous examples include <a href="Langston%20Hughes">Langston Hughes</a>, <a href="James%20Baldwin%20%28writer%29">James Baldwin</a>, <a href="Richard%20Wright%20%28author%29">Richard Wright</a>, <a href="Zora%20Neale%20Hurston">Zora Neale Hurston</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Ellison">Ralph Ellison</a>, Nobel Prize winner <a href="Toni%20Morrison">Toni Morrison</a>, and <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>.

African-American inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international <a href="innovation">innovation</a>. <a href="Norbert%20Rillieux">Norbert Rillieux</a> created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals. Moreover, Rillieux left <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> in 1854 and went to France, where he spent ten years working with the Champollions deciphering <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphics</a> from the <a href="Rosetta%20Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>. Most slave inventors were nameless, such as the slave owned by the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> President Jefferson Davis who designed the ship propeller used by the Confederate navy.

By 1913 over 1,000 inventions were patented by black Americans. Among the most notable inventors were <a href="Jan%20Matzeliger">Jan Matzeliger</a>, who developed the first machine to mass-produce shoes, and <a href="Elijah%20McCoy">Elijah McCoy</a>, who invented automatic lubrication devices for steam engines. <a href="Granville%20Woods">Granville Woods</a> had 35 patents to improve electric railway systems, including the first system to allow moving trains to communicate. <a href="Garrett%20A.%20Morgan">Garrett A. Morgan</a> developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask.

<a href="Lewis%20Howard%20Latimer">Lewis Howard Latimer</a> invented an improvement for the incandescent light bulb. More recent inventors include <a href="Frederick%20McKinley%20Jones">Frederick McKinley Jones</a>, who invented the movable refrigeration unit for food transport in trucks and trains. <a href="Lloyd%20Quarterman">Lloyd Quarterman</a> worked with six other black scientists on the creation of the atomic bomb (code named the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>.) Quarterman also helped develop the first nuclear reactor, which was used in the atomically powered <a href="submarine">submarine</a> called the Nautilus.

A few other notable examples include the first successful <a href="Cardiac%20surgery">open heart surgery</a>, performed by Dr. <a href="Daniel%20Hale%20Williams">Daniel Hale Williams</a>, and the air conditioner, patented by Frederick McKinley Jones. Dr. <a href="Mark%20Dean%20%28computer%20scientist%29">Mark Dean</a> holds three of the original nine patents on the computer on which all PCs are based. More current contributors include <a href="Otis%20Boykin">Otis Boykin</a>, whose inventions included several novel methods for manufacturing electrical components that found use in applications such as guided missile systems and computers, and Colonel <a href="Frederick%20D.%20Gregory">Frederick Gregory</a>, who was not only the first black <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a> pilot but the person who redesigned the cockpits for the last three space shuttles. Gregory was also on the team that pioneered the microwave instrumentation landing system.

The term "African American" carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than to ancestry, and were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry; people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law. The terms (such as "<a href="colored">colored</a>", "<a href="person%20of%20color">person of color</a>", or "<a href="negro">negro</a>") were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a> and <a href="oppression">oppression</a>. There developed among blacks in America a growing desire for a term of self-identification of their own choosing.

In the 1980s, the term "African American" was advanced on the model of, for example, <a href="German-American">German-American</a> or <a href="Irish-American">Irish-American</a> to give descendants of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery era</a> a <a href="Cultural%20heritage">heritage</a> and a cultural base. The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after <a href="Jesse%20Jackson">Jesse Jackson</a> publicly used the term in front of a national audience in 1988. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.

Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for "African American" versus "Black American", although they have a slight preference for "Black American" in personal settings and "African American" in more formal settings.

Many African Americans have expressed a preference for the term "African American" because it was formed in the same way as the terms for the many other ethnic groups currently living in the nation. Some argued further that, because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the United States under <a href="Slavery">chattel slavery</a>, most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.

The term "African American" embraces pan-Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as <a href="Marcus%20Garvey">Marcus Garvey</a>, <a href="W.%20E.%20B.%20Du%20Bois">W. E. B. Du Bois</a> and <a href="George%20Padmore">George Padmore</a>. The term "Afro-Usonian", and variations of such, are more rarely used.

Since 1977, in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion, the United States government has officially classified black people (revised to "black" or "African American" in 1997) as "having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa." Other federal offices, such as the <a href="United%20States%20Census">United States Census</a> Bureau, adhere to the <a href="Office%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget">Office of Management and Budget</a> standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts. In preparation for the United States 2010 Census, a marketing and outreach plan, called "2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan" (ICC) recognized and defined African Americans as black people born in the United States. From the ICC perspective, African Americans are one of three groups of black people in the United States.

The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity. The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the U.S. as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background. The U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes black or African-American people as "A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa" through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook (1978) and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, derived from the 1977 Office of Management and Budget classification.

Historically, "race mixing" between <a href="Black%20%28people%29">black</a> and <a href="White%20American">white</a> people was taboo in the United States. So-called <a href="anti-miscegenation%20laws">anti-miscegenation laws</a>, barring blacks and whites from marrying or having sex, were established in <a href="colonial%20America">colonial America</a> as early as 1691, and endured in many Southern states until the Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in "<a href="Loving%20v.%20Virginia">Loving v. Virginia</a>" (1967). The taboo among American whites surrounding white-black relations is a historical consequence of the oppression and <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> of African Americans. Historian David Brion Davis notes the racial mixing that occurred during slavery was frequently attributed by the <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">planter class</a> to the "lower-class white males" but Davis concludes that "there is abundant evidence that many slaveowners, sons of slaveowners, and overseers took black mistresses or in effect raped the wives and daughters of slave families." A famous example was Thomas Jefferson's mistress, <a href="Sally%20Hemings">Sally Hemings</a>.

<a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> historian <a href="Henry%20Louis%20Gates%20Jr.">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</a> wrote in 2009 that "African Americans [...] are a racially mixed or mulatto people—deeply and overwhelmingly so" (see <a href="%23Genetics">genetics</a>). After the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, Chinese American men married African-American women in high proportions to their total marriage numbers due to few Chinese American women being in the United States. African slaves and their descendants have also had a history of cultural exchange and <a href="Miscegenation">intermarriage</a> with <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, although they did not necessarily retain social, cultural or linguistic ties to Native peoples. There are also increasing intermarriages and offspring between non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics of any race, especially between Puerto Ricans and African Americans (American-born blacks). According to author M.M. Drymon, many African Americans identify as having <a href="Scotch-Irish%20American">Scots-Irish</a> ancestry.

Racially mixed marriages have become increasingly accepted in the United States since the Civil Rights Movement and up to the present day. Approval in national opinion polls have risen from 36% in 1978, to 48% in 1991, 65% in 2002, 77% in 2007. A Gallup poll conducted in 2013 found that 84% of whites and 96% of blacks approved of interracial marriage, and 87% overall.

In her book "The End of Blackness", as well as in an essay on the liberal website "<a href="Salon.com">Salon</a>", author <a href="Debra%20Dickerson">Debra Dickerson</a> has argued that the term "black" should refer strictly to the descendants of Africans who were brought to America as slaves, and not to the sons and daughters of black immigrants who lack that ancestry. In her opinion, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, who is the son of a Kenyan immigrant, although technically black, is not African-American. She makes the argument that grouping all people of African descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American community of slave descendants, in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds. "Lumping us all together", Dickerson wrote, "erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress".

Similar viewpoints have been expressed by <a href="Stanley%20Crouch">Stanley Crouch</a> in a "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" piece, <a href="Charles%20Steele%2C%20Jr.">Charles Steele, Jr.</a> of the <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> and African-American columnist <a href="David%20Ehrenstein">David Ehrenstein</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were "<a href="Magic%20Negro">Magic Negro</a>s", a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white (as cultural protagonists/drivers) agenda. Ehrenstein went on to say "He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history."

Former Secretary of State <a href="Condoleezza%20Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a> (who was famously mistaken for a "recent American immigrant" by French President <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>), said "descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start, and I think you continue to see some of the effects of that." She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African Americans and instead prefers the term "black" or "white" to denote the African and European U.S. founding populations.

Before the independence of the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> until the abolition of slavery in 1865, an African-American slave was commonly known as a "<a href="negro">negro</a>". "<a href="Free%20negro">Free negro</a>" was the legal status in the territory of an African-American person who was not a slave. The term "<a href="colored">colored</a>" later also began to be used until the second quarter of the 20th century, when it was considered outmoded and generally gave way again to the exclusive use of "negro". By the 1940s, the term was commonly capitalized ("Negro"); but by the mid-1960s, it was considered disparaging. By the end of the 20th century, "negro" had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a <a href="pejorative">pejorative</a>. The term is rarely used by younger black people, but remained in use by many older African Americans who had grown up with the term, particularly in the southern U.S. The term remains in use in some contexts, such as the <a href="United%20Negro%20College%20Fund">United Negro College Fund</a>, an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 39 private historically black colleges and universities, as well as in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> where Spanish and Portuguese are spoken. Pronounced slightly differently, it is the word for the color "black", and is rarely perceived as a pejorative.

There are many other deliberately insulting terms. Many were in common use (e.g., "<a href="nigger">nigger</a>"), but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century. One exception is the use, among the black community, of the slur "nigger" rendered as "<a href="nigga">nigga</a>", representing the pronunciation of the word in <a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">African American Vernacular English</a>. This usage has been popularized by the <a href="rap">rap</a> and <a href="hip-hop">hip-hop</a> music cultures and is used as part of an in-group lexicon and speech. It is not necessarily derogatory and, when used among black people, the word is often used to mean "<a href="homie">homie</a>" or "friend".

Acceptance of intra-group usage of the word "nigga" is still debated, although it has established a foothold among younger generations. The <a href="NAACP">NAACP</a> denounces the use of both "nigga" and "nigger". Mixed-race usage of "nigga" is still considered taboo, particularly if the speaker is white. However, trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even among white youth due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture.

Whether or not the original Artistic License is a <a href="free%20software%20license">free software license</a> is largely unsettled. The <a href="Free%20Software%20Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> explicitly called the original Artistic License a non-free license, criticizing it as being "too vague; some passages are too clever for their own good, and their meaning is not clear". The FSF recommended that the license not be used on its own, but approved the common AL/GPL <a href="dual-licensing">dual-licensing</a> approach for Perl projects.

In response to this, <a href="Bradley%20Kuhn">Bradley Kuhn</a>, who later worked for the Free Software Foundation, made a minimal redraft to clarify the ambiguous passages.

Afrikaans

Afrikaans () is a <a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">West Germanic language</a> spoken in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a> and <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>. It evolved from the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch vernacular</a> of <a href="South%20Holland">South Holland</a> (<a href="Hollandic%20dialect">Hollandic dialect</a>) spoken by the mainly <a href="Afrikaners">Dutch settlers</a> of what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century. Hence, it is a <a href="daughter%20language">daughter language</a> of Dutch, and was previously referred to as "Cape Dutch" (a term also used to refer collectively to the <a href="Cape%20Dutch">early Cape settlers</a>) or "kitchen Dutch" (a derogatory term used to refer to Afrikaans in its earlier days). However, it is also variously described as a <a href="Creole%20language">creole</a> or as a partially <a href="Creolisation">creolised</a> language. The term is ultimately derived from Dutch "" meaning "African Dutch". It is the first language of most of the <a href="Afrikaners">Afrikaners</a> and <a href="Coloureds">Coloureds</a> of Southern Africa.

Although Afrikaans has adopted words from other languages, including <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, the <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu languages</a>, <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a> and the <a href="Khoisan%20languages">Khoisan languages</a>, an estimated 90 to 95% of the vocabulary of Afrikaans is of Dutch origin. Therefore, <a href="Differences%20between%20Afrikaans%20and%20Dutch">differences with Dutch</a> often lie in the more <a href="analytic%20language">analytic</a> <a href="Morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphology</a> and grammar of Afrikaans, and a spelling that expresses Afrikaans pronunciation rather than standard Dutch. There is a large degree of <a href="mutual%20intelligibility">mutual intelligibility</a> between the two languages—especially in written form.

With about 7 million native speakers in South Africa, or 13.5% of the population, it is the third-most-spoken language in the country. It has the widest geographical and racial distribution of all the eleven official <a href="languages%20of%20South%20Africa">languages of South Africa</a>, and is widely spoken and understood as a second or third language. It is the majority language of the western half of South Africa—the provinces of the <a href="Northern%20Cape">Northern Cape</a> and <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a>—and the first language of 75.8% of <a href="Coloured">Coloured</a> South Africans (4.8 million people), 60.8% of White South Africans (2.7 million); 4.6% of <a href="Asian%20South%20African">Asian South African</a>s (58,000 people), and 1.5% of black South Africans (600,000 people).

In addition, many native speakers of <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu languages</a> and <a href="South%20African%20English">English</a> also speak Afrikaans as a second language. It is taught in schools, with about 10.3 million second-language students. One reason for the expansion of Afrikaans is its development in the public realm: it is used in newspapers, radio programs, TV, and several translations of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> have been published since the first one was completed in 1933.

In neighbouring <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, Afrikaans is widely spoken as a second language and used as a "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>", while as a native language it is spoken in 10.4% of households, mainly concentrated in the capital <a href="Windhoek">Windhoek</a>, Walvis Bay, Swakopmund and the southern regions of <a href="Hardap%20Region">Hardap</a> and <a href="%C7%81Karas%20Region">ǁKaras</a>. It, along with <a href="German%20language%20in%20Namibia">German</a>, was among the official <a href="languages%20of%20Namibia">languages of Namibia</a> until the country <a href="independence%20of%20Namibia">became independent</a> in 1990, 25% of the population of <a href="Windhoek">Windhoek</a> spoke Afrikaans at home. Both Afrikaans and German are recognised regional languages in Namibia, although only <a href="Namlish">English</a> has official status within the government.

Estimates of the total number of Afrikaans speakers range between 15 and 23 million.

The term is ultimately derived from the Dutch term " meaning "African Dutch".

The Afrikaans language arose in the <a href="Dutch%20Cape%20Colony">Dutch Cape Colony</a>, through a gradual divergence from European Dutch dialects, during the course of the 18th century. As early as the mid-18th century and as recently as the mid-20th century, Afrikaans was known in standard Dutch as a "kitchen language" (), lacking the prestige accorded, for example, even by the educational system in Africa, to languages spoken outside Africa. Other early epithets setting apart ' ("Cape Dutch", i.e. Afrikaans) as putatively beneath official Dutch standards included ', ' and ' ("mutilated/broken/uncivilised Dutch"), as well as " ("incorrect Dutch").

An estimated 90 to 95% of Afrikaans vocabulary is ultimately of Dutch origin, and there are few lexical differences between the two languages. Afrikaans has a considerably more regular morphology, grammar, and spelling. There is a degree of <a href="mutual%20intelligibility">mutual intelligibility</a> between the two languages, particularly in written form.

Afrikaans acquired some lexical and syntactical borrowings from other languages such as <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>, <a href="Khoisan%20languages">Khoisan languages</a>, <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, and of the <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu languages</a>, and Afrikaans has also been significantly influenced by <a href="South%20African%20English">South African English</a>. Dutch speakers are confronted with fewer non-cognates when listening to Afrikaans than the other way round. Mutual intelligibility thus tends to be asymmetrical, as it is easier for Dutch speakers to understand Afrikaans than for Afrikaans speakers to understand Dutch.

In general, mutual intelligibility between Dutch and Afrikaans is better than between Dutch and <a href="West%20Frisian%20language">Frisian</a> or <a href="North%20Germanic%20languages%23Mutual%20intelligibility">between</a> <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a> and <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a>. The South African poet writer <a href="Breyten%20Breytenbach">Breyten Breytenbach</a>, attempting to visualize the language distance for <a href="English-speaking%20world">anglophones</a> once remarked that the differences between (Standard) Dutch and Afrikaans are comparable to those between the <a href="Received%20Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a> and <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern American English</a>.

A relative majority of the first settlers whose descendants today are the <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a>s were from the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Seven%20United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20Netherlands">United Provinces</a> (now <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>), though up to one-sixth of the community was also of French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> origin, and a seventh from Germany.

The workers and slaves who contributed to the development of Afrikaans were imported by Dutch traders from parts of eastern Africa, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (modern <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>). A number were also indigenous <a href="Khoisan">Khoisan</a> people, who were valued as interpreters and domestic servants. Many of the slaves cohabited with the earliest Dutch settlers, with the result that 75% of children born to slaves in the Dutch Cape Colony between 1652 and 1672 had one Dutch parent. This resulted in the formation of a new ethnic group, the <a href="Cape%20Coloured">Cape Coloured</a>s, who adopted various forms of speech utilising a Dutch vocabulary.

Beginning in about 1815, Afrikaans started to replace Malay as the language of instruction in <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> schools in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, written with the <a href="Arabic%20alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a>: see <a href="Arabic%20Afrikaans">Arabic Afrikaans</a>. Later, Afrikaans, now written with the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>, started to appear in newspapers and political and religious works in around 1850.

In 1875, a group of Afrikaans-speakers from the Cape formed the "" ("Society for Real Afrikaners"), and published a number of books in Afrikaans including grammars, dictionaries, religious materials and histories. In 1925, Afrikaans was recognised by the South African government as a real language, rather than simply a slang version of Dutch proper.

Afrikaans was considered a Dutch <a href="dialect">dialect</a> in South Africa until the early 20th century, when it became recognised as a distinct language under South African law, alongside Standard Dutch, which it eventually replaced as an official language.

Before the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20South%20Africa%23Boer%20Wars">Boer Wars</a> (1880–81 and 1899–1902), "and indeed for some time afterwards, Afrikaans was regarded as inappropriate for educated discourse. Rather, Afrikaans was described derogatorily as ‘a kitchen language’ or as ‘a bastard jargon', suitable for communication mainly between the Boers and their servants." 23 years after the Second Boer War ended in 1902, mostly due to the efforts of the Afrikans Language Movement on 8 May 1925, the Official Languages of the Union Act No 8 of 1925 was passed at a joint sitting of the House of Assembly and the Senate, in which 'Dutch' was "<a href="Official%20Languages%20of%20the%20Union%20Act%2C%201925">declared to include Afrikaans</a>". The <a href="South%20African%20Constitution%20of%201961">Constitution of 1961</a> reversed the position of Afrikaans and Dutch, so that English and Afrikaans were the official languages and Afrikaans was deemed to include Dutch. The <a href="South%20African%20Constitution%20of%201983">Constitution of 1983</a> removed any mention of Dutch altogether.

The <a href="Afrikaans%20Language%20Monument">Afrikaans Language Monument</a> (') is located on a hill overlooking <a href="Paarl">Paarl</a>, <a href="Western%20Cape%20Province">Western Cape Province</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. Officially opened on 10 October 1975, it commemorates the 50th anniversary of Afrikaans being declared an official language of South Africa in distinction to <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>. It was erected in Paarl on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the ' (Society of Real <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a>s), an organisation which helped to strengthen Afrikaners' identity and pride in their language.

The linguist Paul Roberge suggested the earliest 'truly Afrikaans' texts are <a href="doggerel">doggerel verse</a> from 1795 and a dialogue transcribed by a Dutch traveller in 1825. Printed material among the Afrikaners at first used only standard European Dutch. By the mid-19th century, more and more were appearing in Afrikaans, which was very much still regarded as a set of regional dialects.

In 1861, L.H. Meurant published his ' ("Conversation between Claus Truthsayer and John Doubter"), which is considered by some to be the first authoritative Afrikaans text. <a href="Abu%20Bakr%20Effendi">Abu Bakr Effendi</a> also compiled his <a href="Arabic%20Afrikaans">Arabic Afrikaans</a> <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> instruction book between 1862 and 1869, although this was only published and printed in 1877. The first Afrikaans grammars and dictionaries were published in 1875 by the ' ("Society for Real Afrikaners") in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>.

The main Afrikaans dictionary is the ' (WAT) ("Dictionary of the Afrikaans Language"), which is as yet incomplete owing to the scale of the project, but the one-volume dictionary in household use is the ' (HAT). The official <a href="orthography">orthography</a> of Afrikaans is the ", compiled by .

A major landmark in the development of the language was the translation of the whole <a href="Bible">Bible</a> into Afrikaans. Before this, most Cape Dutch-Afrikaans speakers had to rely on the Dutch . This had its origins with the <a href="Synod%20of%20Dordrecht">Synod of Dordrecht</a> of 1618 and was thus in an <a href="archaism">archaic</a> form of Dutch. This was hard for Dutch and Cape Dutch speakers to understand, and increasingly unintelligible for Afrikaans speakers.

C. P. Hoogehout, , and <a href="Stephanus%20Jacobus%20du%20Toit">Stephanus Jacobus du Toit</a> were the first <a href="Bible%20translations%20%28Afrikaans%29">Afrikaans Bible</a> translators. Important landmarks in the translation of the Scriptures were in 1878 with C. P. Hoogehout's translation of the " (<a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Gospel of Mark</a>, lit. Gospel according to Mark); however, this translation was never published. The manuscript is to be found in the South African National Library, Cape Town.

The first official translation of the entire Bible into Afrikaans was in 1933 by <a href="Totius%20%28poet%29">J. D. du Toit</a>, E. E. van Rooyen, J. D. Kestell, H. C. M. Fourie, and <a href="BB%20Keet">BB Keet</a>. This monumental work established Afrikaans as "", that is "a pure and proper language" for religious purposes, especially amongst the deeply <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> Afrikaans religious community that previously had been sceptical of a <a href="Bible%20translation">Bible translation</a> that varied from the Dutch version that they were used to.

In 1983, a fresh translation marked the 50th anniversary of the 1933 version and provided a much-needed revision. The final editing of this edition was done by E. P. Groenewald, A. H. van Zyl, P. A. Verhoef, J. L. Helberg and W. Kempen.


Afrikaans belongs to its own <a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">West Germanic</a> sub-group, the <a href="Low%20Franconian%20languages">Low Franconian languages</a>. Its closest relative is the <a href="mutual%20intelligibility">mutually-intelligible</a> mother language, <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch language</a>. Other West Germanic languages related to Afrikaans are <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="English%20language">English</a> and the <a href="Frisian%20languages">Frisian languages</a> and the unstandardised languages <a href="Low%20German">Low German</a> and <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>.

Some state that instead of "Afrikaners", which refers to an ethnic group, the terms ' or ' (lit. Afrikaans speakers) should be used for people of any ethnic origin who speak Afrikaans. Linguistic identity has not yet established which terms shall prevail, and all three are used in common parlance. The white Afrikaans-speaking community started being referred to colloquially as "The Boere". The terms ' (farm boy) and ' (farm girl) became popular among young white Afrikaners for expressing national pride, regardless of whether or not they actually grew up on a farm.

Afrikaans is also widely spoken in Namibia. Before independence, Afrikaans had equal status with German as an official language. Since independence in 1990, Afrikaans has had constitutional recognition as a national, but not official, language. There is a much smaller number of Afrikaans speakers among Zimbabwe's white minority, as most have left the country since 1980. Afrikaans was also a medium of instruction for schools in <a href="Bophuthatswana">Bophuthatswana</a>, an Apartheid-era <a href="Bantustan">Bantustan</a>.

Many South Africans living and working in Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the <a href="UAE">UAE</a> and <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> are also Afrikaans-speaking. They have access to Afrikaans websites, news sites such as <a href="http%3A//www.netwerk24.com/">Netwerk24.com</a> and <a href="http%3A//www.sake24.com/">Sake24</a>, and radio broadcasts over the web, such as those from <a href="Radio%20Sonder%20Grense">Radio Sonder Grense</a>, <a href="Bokradio">Bokradio</a> and <a href="Radio%20Pretoria">Radio Pretoria</a>.

Afrikaans has been influential in the development of <a href="South%20African%20English">South African English</a>. Many Afrikaans loanwords have found their way into South African English, such as ' ("pickup truck"), ' ("barbecue"), ' ("tangerine"), ' (American "sneakers", British "trainers", Canadian "runners"). A few words in standard English are derived from Afrikaans, such as "<a href="aardvark">aardvark</a>" (lit. "earth pig"), "<a href="trekking">trek</a>" ("pioneering journey", in Afrikaans lit. "pull" but used also for "migrate"), "spoor" ("animal track"), ' ("Southern African grassland" in Afrikaans, lit. "field"), "commando" from Afrikaans ' meaning small fighting unit, ' ("tree snake") and ' ("segregation"; more accurately "apartness" or "the state or condition of being apart").

In 1976, secondary-school pupils in <a href="Soweto">Soweto</a> began <a href="Soweto%20riots">a rebellion</a> in response to the government's decision that Afrikaans be used as the language of instruction for half the subjects taught in non-White schools (with English continuing for the other half). Although English is the mother tongue of only 8.2% of the population, it is the language most widely understood, and the second language of a majority of South Africans. Afrikaans is more widely spoken than English in the Northern and Western Cape provinces, several hundred kilometres from Soweto.

The Black community's opposition to Afrikaans and preference for continuing English instruction was underlined when the government rescinded the policy one month after the uprising: 96% of Black schools chose English (over Afrikaans or native languages) as the language of instruction. Also, due to Afrikaans being viewed as the language of the white oppressor by some, pressure has been increased to remove Afrikaans as a teaching language in South African universities, resulting in bloody student protests in 2015.

Under <a href="Constitution%20of%20South%20Africa">South Africa's Constitution</a> of 1996, Afrikaans remains an official language, and has equal status to English and nine other languages. The new policy means that the use of Afrikaans is now often reduced in favour of English, or to accommodate the other official languages. In 1996, for example, the <a href="South%20African%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">South African Broadcasting Corporation</a> reduced the amount of television airtime in Afrikaans, while <a href="South%20African%20Airways">South African Airways</a> dropped its Afrikaans name " from its <a href="livery">livery</a>. Similarly, South Africa's <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a>s overseas now only display the name of the country in English and their host country's language, and not in Afrikaans.

In spite of these moves, the language has remained strong, and Afrikaans newspapers and magazines continue to have large circulation figures. Indeed, the Afrikaans-language general-interest family magazine ' has the largest readership of any magazine in the country. In addition, a pay-TV channel in Afrikaans called <a href="KykNet">KykNet</a> was launched in 1999, and an Afrikaans music channel, <a href="MK%20%28channel%29">MK</a> (') (lit. 'Music Channel'), in 2005. A large number of Afrikaans books are still published every year, mainly by the publishers Human & Rousseau, , , and . The Afrikaans film trilogy " (first released in 2008) caused a reawakening of the Afrikaans film Industry (which has been dead since the mid to late 1990s) and Belgian-born singer <a href="Karen%20Zoid">Karen Zoid</a>'s debut single "" (released 2001) caused a resurgence in the Afrikaans music industry as well as gave rise to the Afrikaans Rock genre.

Afrikaans has two monuments erected in its honour. The first was erected in , South Africa, in 1893, and the second, nowadays better-known <a href="Afrikaans%20Language%20Monument">Afrikaans Language Monument</a> (""), was built in <a href="Paarl">Paarl</a>, South Africa, in 1975.

When the British design magazine "<a href="Wallpaper%20%28magazine%29">Wallpaper</a>" described Afrikaans as "one of the world's ugliest languages" in its September 2005 article about the <a href="Afrikaans%20Language%20Monument">monument</a>, South African <a href="billionaire">billionaire</a> <a href="Johann%20Rupert">Johann Rupert</a> (chairman of the <a href="Richemont">Richemont Group</a>), responded by withdrawing advertising for brands such as <a href="Cartier%20SA">Cartier</a>, <a href="Van%20Cleef%20%26amp%3B%20Arpels">Van Cleef & Arpels</a>, <a href="Montblanc%20%28pens%29">Montblanc</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Dunhill">Alfred Dunhill</a> from the magazine. The author of the article, Bronwyn Davies, was an <a href="South%20African%20English">English</a>-speaking South African.

Modern Dutch and Afrikaans share over 90 percent of their vocabulary. Afrikaans speakers are able to learn Dutch within a comparatively short time. Native Dutch speakers pick up written Afrikaans even more quickly, due to its simplified grammar, whereas understanding spoken Afrikaans might need more effort. Afrikaans speakers can learn Dutch pronunciation with little training. This has enabled Dutch and Belgian companies to <a href="outsourcing">outsource</a> their <a href="call%20centre">call centre</a> operations to South Africa.

<a href="Post-apartheid%20South%20Africa">Post-apartheid South Africa</a> has seen a loss of preferential treatment by the government for Afrikaans, in terms of education, social events, media (TV and radio), and general status throughout the country, given that it now shares its place as official language with ten other languages. Nevertheless, Afrikaans remains more prevalent in the media – radio, newspapers and television – than any of the other official languages, except English. More than 300 book titles in Afrikaans are published annually. South African census figures suggest a growing number of speakers in all nine provinces, a total of 6.85 million in 2011 compared to 5.98 million a decade earlier. The South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) project that a growing majority will be <a href="Coloured">Coloured</a> Afrikaans speakers. Afrikaans speakers experience higher employment rates than other South African language groups, though half a million remain unemployed.

Despite the challenges of demotion and emigration that it faces in South Africa, the Afrikaans vernacular remains competitive, being popular in <a href="DSTV">DSTV</a> pay channels and several internet sites, while generating high newspaper and music CD sales. A resurgence in Afrikaans popular music since the late 1990s has invigorated the language, especially among a younger generation of South Africans. A recent trend is the increased availability of pre-school educational CDs and DVDs. Such media also prove popular with the extensive Afrikaans-speaking expatriate communities who seek to retain language proficiency in a household context.

After years of slumber, Afrikaans language cinema is showing signs of new vigour. The 2007 film ', the first full-length Afrikaans movie since <a href="Paljas">Paljas</a> of 1998, is seen as the dawn of a new era in Afrikaans cinema. Several short films have been created and more feature-length movies, such as ' and ' (both in 2008) have been produced, besides the 2011 Afrikaans-language film ', which was the first Afrikaans film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival. The film "" was also released in 2011. The Afrikaans Film industry started gaining international recognition via the likes of big Afrikaans Hollywood film stars, like <a href="Charlize%20Theron">Charlize Theron</a> ("<a href="Monster%20%282003%20film%29">Monster</a>") and <a href="Sharlto%20Copley">Sharlto Copley</a> ("<a href="District%209">District 9</a>") promoting their mother tongue.

Afrikaans seems to be returning to the <a href="SABC">SABC</a>. SABC3 announced early in 2009 that it would increase Afrikaans programming due to the "growing Afrikaans-language market and [their] need for working capital as Afrikaans advertising is the only advertising that sells in the current South African television market". In April 2009, SABC3 started screening several Afrikaans-language programmes. Further latent support for the language derives from its de-politicised image in the eyes of younger-generation South Africans, who less and less often view it as "the language of the oppressor". Indeed, there is a groundswell movement within Afrikaans to be inclusive, and to promote itself along with the other indigenous official languages. In Namibia, the percentage of Afrikaans speakers declined from 11.4% (2001 Census) to 10.4% (2011 Census). The major concentrations are in Hardap (41.0%), ǁKaras (36.1%), Erongo (20.5%), Khomas (18.5%), Omaheke (10.0%), Otjozondjupa (9.4%), Kunene (4.2%), and Oshikoto (2.3%).

Following early dialectal studies of Afrikaans, it was theorised that three main historical dialects probably existed after the Great Trek in the 1830s. These dialects are the Northern Cape, Western Cape, and Eastern Cape dialects. Northern Cape dialect may have resulted from contact between Dutch settlers and the <a href="Khoi-Khoi">Khoi-Khoi</a> people between the Great Karoo and the Kunene, and Eastern Cape dialect between the Dutch and the Xhosa. Remnants of these dialects still remain in present-day Afrikaans, although the standardising effect of Standard Afrikaans has contributed to a great levelling of differences in modern times.

There is also a prison <a href="cant%20%28language%29">cant</a>, known as or , which is based on Afrikaans, yet heavily influenced by <a href="Zulu%20language">Zulu</a>. This language is used as a secret language in prison and is taught to initiates.

The term " ("Cape Afrikaans") is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the entire Western Cape dialect; it is more commonly used for a particular sociolect spoken in the <a href="Cape%20Peninsula">Cape Peninsula</a> of South Africa. was once spoken by all population groups. However, it became increasingly restricted to the <a href="Cape%20Coloured">Cape Coloured</a> <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a> in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> and environs.



An example of characteristic :
The term " ("Afrikaans of the Orange River") is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the Northern Cape dialect; it is more commonly used for the regional peculiarities of standard Afrikaans spoken in the <a href="Upington">Upington</a>/<a href="Orange%20River%20wine%20district">Orange River wine district</a> of South Africa.

Some of the characteristics of are the plural form ' ("Ma-", '), variant pronunciation such as in ' ("Church") and ' ("money") and the ending ", which indicates possession.

Although Afrikaans is mainly spoken in South Africa and Namibia, smaller Afrikaans-speaking populations live in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, Australia, <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, Canada, <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>, <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, New Zealand, <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>, the UAE, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, the USA, <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, and <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>. Most Afrikaans-speaking people living outside Africa are emigrants and their descendants. Because of <a href="emigration">emigration</a> and migrant labour, more than 100,000 Afrikaans speakers may live in the United Kingdom.

Due to the early settlement of a <a href="Cape%20Malay">Cape Malay</a> community in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, who are now known as <a href="Coloured">Coloured</a>s, numerous Malay words were brought into Afrikaans. Some of these words entered Dutch via the <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian language</a> as part of the colonial heritage. Malay words in Afrikaans include:

Some words originally came from Portuguese such as ' ("umbrella") from the Portuguese ', ' ("pen/cattle enclosure") from the Portuguese ', and ' ("corn", from '). These words have become common in South Africa to an extent of being used in many other <a href="Languages%20of%20South%20Africa">South African languages</a>. Some of these words also exist in Dutch, like " "parasol", though usage is less common and meanings can slightly differ.


Some of these words also exist in Dutch, though with a more specific meaning: ' for example means "South-African tribal javelin" and ' means "South-African tribal blanket of animal hides".

Loanwords from <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu languages</a> in Afrikaans include the names of indigenous birds, such as ' and ', and plants, such as ' and '.

In Afrikaans grammar, there is no distinction between the <a href="infinitive">infinitive</a> and present forms of verbs, with the exception of the verbs 'to be' and 'to have':
In addition, verbs do not <a href="grammatical%20conjugation">conjugate</a> differently depending on the subject. For example,
Only a handful of Afrikaans verbs have a <a href="preterite">preterite</a>, namely the auxiliary ' ("to be"), the <a href="modal%20verbs">modal verbs</a>, and the verb ' ("to think"). The preterite of " ("may") is rare in contemporary Afrikaans.

All other verbs use the perfect tense ("hê" + past participle) for the past. Therefore, there is no distinction in Afrikaans between "I drank" and "I have drunk". (Also in colloquial German, the past tense is often replaced with the perfect.)

When telling a longer story, Afrikaans speakers usually avoid the perfect and simply use the present tense, or <a href="historical%20present%20tense">historical present tense</a> instead (as is possible, but less common, in English as well).

A particular feature of Afrikaans is its use of the <a href="double%20negative">double negative</a>; it is classified in Afrikaans as " and is something that is absent from the other West Germanic standard languages. For example,

Both French and San origins have been suggested for double negation in Afrikaans. While double negation is still found in <a href="Low%20Franconian%20dialects">Low Franconian dialects</a> in <a href="West-Flanders">West-Flanders</a> and in some "isolated" villages in the centre of the Netherlands (such as <a href="Garderen">Garderen</a>), it takes a different form, which is not found in Afrikaans. The following is an example:

The ' was the Middle Dutch way to negate but it has been suggested that since ' became highly non-voiced, or was needed to complement the '. With time the ' disappeared in most Dutch dialects.

The double negative construction has been fully grammaticalised in standard Afrikaans and its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as the examples below show:

A notable exception to this is the use of the negating grammar form that coincides with negating the English present participle. In this case there is only a single negation.

Certain words in Afrikaans arise due to grammar. For example, ', which literally means "must not", usually becomes '; although one does not have to write or say it like this, virtually all Afrikaans speakers will change the two words to " in the same way as "do not" shifts to "don't" in English.

The Dutch word ' ("it" in English) does not correspond to ' in Afrikaans. The Dutch words corresponding to Afrikaans ' are ', ', ' and ".




There are many parallels to the <a href="Dutch%20orthography">Dutch orthography</a> conventions and those used for Afrikaans. There are 26 letters.

In Afrikaans, many consonants are dropped from the earlier Dutch spelling. For example, ' ('only') in Dutch becomes ' in Afrikaans. Also, Afrikaans and some Dutch dialects make no distinction between and , having merged the latter into the former; while the word for "south" is written ' in Dutch, it is spelled ' in Afrikaans (as well as dialectal Dutch writings) to represent this merger. Similarly, the Dutch digraph ', normally pronounced as , is written as ', except where it replaces the Dutch <a href="affix">suffix</a> "" which is pronounced as or , as in " > ".

Another difference is the indefinite article, ' in Afrikaans and in Dutch. "A book" is ' in Afrikaans, whereas it is either ' or ' in Dutch. This "" is usually pronounced as just a <a href="weak%20vowel">weak vowel</a>, .

The <a href="diminutive">diminutive</a> suffix in Afrikaans is ', whereas in Dutch it is ', hence a "bit" is in Afrikaans and in Dutch.

The letters "c", "q", "x", and "z" occur almost exclusively in borrowings from French, English, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> and <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>. This is usually because words that had "c" and "ch" in the original Dutch are spelled with "k" and "g", respectively, in Afrikaans. Similarly original "qu" and "x" are spelt "kw" and "ks", respectively. For example, ' instead of "equatoriaal", and ' instead of "excuus".

The vowels with diacritics in non-loanword Afrikaans are: "á", "é", "è", "ê", "ë", "í", "î", "ï", "ó", "ô", "ú", "û", "ý". Diacritics are ignored when alphabetising, though they are still important, even when typing the diacritic forms may be difficult. For example, ' instead of the 3 e's alongside each other: "*", which can never occur in Afrikaans, or ', which translates to "say", whereas " is a possessive form.

A few short words in Afrikaans take initial apostrophes. In modern Afrikaans, these words are always written in lower case (except if the entire line is uppercase), and if they occur at the beginning of a sentence, the next word is capitalised. Three examples of such apostrophed words are '. The last (the indefinite article) is the only apostrophed word that is common in modern written Afrikaans, since the other examples are shortened versions of other words (' and ", respectively) and are rarely found outside of a poetic context.

Here are a few examples:
The apostrophe and the following letter are regarded as two separate characters, and are never written using a single glyph, although a single character variant of the indefinite article appears in Unicode, .

For more on the pronunciation of the letters below, see "".

Although there are many different dialects and accents, the transcription would be fairly standard.

In the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch language</a> the word ' means African, in the general sense. Consequently, Afrikaans is commonly denoted as '. This ambiguity also exists in Afrikaans itself and is either resolved in the context of its usage, or by using ' for an <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20Africa">African person</a>, and ' in the adjective sense.

A handful of Afrikaans words are exactly the same as in English. The following Afrikaans sentences, for example, are exactly the same in the two languages, in terms of both their meaning and spelling; only their pronunciation differs.

Aeolus

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Aeolus (; "Aiolos" , <a href="Greek%20language">Modern Greek</a>: "quick-moving, nimble") is a name shared by three mythical characters. These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which. <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear that he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here. 
All three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship, especially regarding the second and third Aeolus, is often ambiguous as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers.

Aeolus was also the name of the following minor characters:

The "Alford" guilty plea is named after the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> case of "<a href="North%20Carolina%20v.%20Alford">North Carolina v. Alford</a>" (1970). Henry Alford had been <a href="indictment">indicted</a> on a charge of <a href="first-degree%20murder">first-degree murder</a> in 1963. Evidence in the case included testimony from witnesses that Alford had said, after the victim's death, that he had killed the individual. Court testimony showed that Alford and the victim had argued at the victim's house. Alford left the house, and afterwards the victim received a fatal <a href="gunshot%20wound">gunshot wound</a> when he opened the door responding to a knock.

Alford was faced with the possibility of <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a> if convicted by a <a href="jury%20trial">jury trial</a>. The <a href="death%20penalty">death penalty</a> was the default sentence by <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> law at the time, if two requisites in the case were satisfied: the defendant had to have pleaded not guilty, and the jury did not instead recommend a <a href="life%20sentence">life sentence</a>. Had he pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, Alford would have had the possibility of a life sentence and would have avoided the death penalty, but he did not want to admit guilt. Nonetheless, Alford pleaded guilty to <a href="Murder%20%28United%20States%20law%29%23Degrees%20of%20murder%20in%20the%20United%20States">second-degree murder</a> and said he was doing so to avoid a death sentence, were he to be convicted of first-degree murder, after attempting to contest that charge. Alford was sentenced to 30 years in prison, after the trial judge accepted the plea bargain and ruled that the defendant had been adequately advised by his defense lawyer.
Alford appealed and requested a new trial, arguing he was forced into a guilty plea because he was afraid of receiving a death sentence. The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20North%20Carolina">Supreme Court of North Carolina</a> ruled that the defendant had voluntarily entered the guilty plea, with knowledge of what that meant. Following this ruling, Alford petitioned for a <a href="writ%20of%20habeas%20corpus">writ of habeas corpus</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Middle%20District%20of%20North%20Carolina">United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a>, which upheld the initial ruling, and subsequently to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fourth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a>, which ruled that Alford's plea was not voluntary, because it was made under fear of the death penalty. "I just pleaded guilty because they said if I didn't, they would gas me for it," wrote Alford in one of his appeals.

The case was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court Justice</a> <a href="Byron%20White">Byron White</a> wrote the majority decision, which held that for the plea to be accepted, the defendant must have been advised by a competent lawyer who was able to inform the individual that his best decision in the case would be to enter a guilty plea. The Court ruled that the defendant can enter such a plea "when he concludes that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly indicates guilt". The Court allowed the guilty plea with a simultaneous protestation of innocence only because there was enough evidence to show that the prosecution had a strong case for a conviction, and the defendant was entering such a plea to avoid this possible sentencing. The Court went on to note that even if the defendant could have shown that he would not have entered a guilty plea "but for" the rationale of receiving a lesser sentence, the plea itself would not have been ruled invalid. As evidence existed that could have supported Alford's conviction, the Supreme Court held that his guilty plea was allowable while the defendant himself still maintained that he was not guilty.

Alford died in prison, in 1975.

The "Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and Foreign Political and Legal Terms" defines the term "Alford plea" as: "A plea under which a defendant may choose to plead guilty, not because of an admission to the crime, but because the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to place a charge and to obtain conviction in court. The plea is commonly used in local and state courts in the United States." According to "<a href="University%20of%20Richmond%20Law%20Review">University of Richmond Law Review</a>", "When offering an Alford plea, a defendant asserts his innocence but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict him of the offense." "A Guide to Military Criminal Law" notes that under the Alford plea, "the defendant concedes that the prosecution has enough evidence to convict, but the defendant still refuses to admit guilt." The book "Plea Bargaining's Triumph: A History of Plea Bargaining in America" published by <a href="Stanford%20University%20Press">Stanford University Press</a> defines the plea as one in "which the defendant adheres to his/her claim of innocence even while allowing that the government has enough evidence to prove his/her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt". According to the book "Gender, Crime, and Punishment" published by <a href="Yale%20University%20Press">Yale University Press</a>, "Under the Alford doctrine, a defendant does not admit guilt but admits that the state has sufficient evidence to find him or her guilty, should the case go to trial." "Webster's New World Law Dictionary" defines Alford plea as: "A guilty plea entered as part of a plea bargain by a criminal defendant who denies committing the crime or who does not actually admit his guilt. In federal courts, such plea may be accepted as long as there is evidence that the defendant is actually guilty."

The Alford guilty plea is "a plea of guilty containing a protestation of innocence". The defendant pleads guilty, but does not have to specifically admit to the guilt itself. The defendant maintains a claim of innocence, but agrees to the entry of a conviction in the charged crime. Upon receiving an Alford guilty plea from a defendant, the court may immediately pronounce the defendant guilty and impose <a href="sentence%20%28law%29">sentence</a> as if the defendant had otherwise been convicted of the crime. Sources disagree, as may differing states' laws, as to what category of plea the "Alford" plea falls under: Some sources state that the Alford guilty plea is a form of "<a href="nolo%20contendere">nolo contendere</a>", where the defendant in the case states "no contest" to the factual matter of the case as given in the charges outlined by the prosecution. Others hold that an "Alford" plea is simply one form of a guilty plea, and, as with other guilty pleas, the judge must see there is some factual basis for the plea.

Defendants can take advantage of the ability to use the Alford guilty plea, by admitting there is enough evidence to convict them of a higher crime, while at the same time pleading guilty to a lesser charge. Defendants usually enter an Alford guilty plea if they want to avoid a possible worse sentence were they to lose the case against them at trial. It affords defendants the ability to accept a <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a>, while maintaining innocence.

This form of guilty plea has been frequently used in local and state courts in the United States, though it constitutes a small percentage of all plea bargains in the U.S. This form of plea is not allowed in courts of the <a href="United%20States%20military">United States military</a>. In 2000 the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> noted, "In an Alford plea the defendant agrees to plead guilty because he or she realizes that there is little chance to win acquittal because of the strong evidence of guilt. About 17% of State inmates and 5% of Federal inmates submitted either an Alford plea or a no contest plea, regardless of the type of attorney. This difference reflects the relative readiness of State courts, compared to Federal courts, to accept an alternative plea."

In the 1995 case "State of Idaho v. Howry" before the <a href="Idaho%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Idaho Court of Appeals</a>, the Court commented on the impact of the Alford guilty plea on later sentencing. The Court ruled, "Although an Alford plea allows a defendant to plead guilty amid assertions of innocence, it does not require a court to accept those assertions. The sentencing court may, of necessity, consider a broad range of information, including the evidence of the crime, the defendant's criminal history and the demeanor of the defendant, including the presence or absence of remorse." In the 1999 <a href="South%20Carolina%20Supreme%20Court">South Carolina Supreme Court</a> case "State v. Gaines", the Court held that Alford guilty pleas were to be held valid in the absence of a specific on-the-record ruling that the pleas were voluntary – provided that the sentencing judge acted appropriately in accordance with the rules for acceptance of a plea made voluntarily by the defendant. The Court held that a ruling that the plea was entered into voluntarily is implied by the act of sentencing.
In the 2006 case before the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fifth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a>, "Ballard v. Burton", Judge <a href="Carl%20E.%20Stewart">Carl E. Stewart</a> writing for the Court held that an Alford guilty plea is a "variation of an ordinary guilty plea". In October 2008, the United States Department of Justice defined an Alford plea as: "the defendant maintains his or her innocence with respect to the charge to which he or she offers to plead guilty".

In March 2009, the <a href="Minnesota%20House%20of%20Representatives">Minnesota House of Representatives</a> characterized the Alford plea as: "a form of a guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges on the record that the prosecutor could present enough evidence to prove guilt." The Minnesota Judicial Branch similarly states: "Alford Plea: A plea of guilty that may be accepted by a court even where the defendant does not admit guilt. In an Alford plea, defendant has to admit that he has reviewed the state's evidence, a reasonable jury could find him guilty, and he wants to take advantage of a plea offer that has been made. Court has discretion as to whether to accept this type of plea."

The <a href="U.S.%20Attorneys%27%20Manual">U.S. Attorneys' Manual</a> states that in the federal system, Alford pleas "should be avoided except in the most unusual circumstances, even if no plea agreement is involved and the plea would cover all pending charges." <a href="U.S.%20Attorney">U.S. Attorney</a>s are required to obtain the approval of the <a href="Assistant%20Attorney%20General">Assistant Attorney General</a> with supervisory responsibility over the subject matter before accepting such a plea.

In his book "American Criminal Justice" (1972), Jonathan D. Caplan comments on the Supreme Court decision, noting, "The "Alford" decision recognizes the plea-bargaining system, acknowledging that a man may maintain his innocence but still plead guilty in order to minimize his potential loss." Caplan comments on the impact of the Supreme Court's decision to require evidence of guilt in such a plea: "By requiring that there be some evidence of guilt in such a situation, the decision attempts to protect the 'really' innocent from the temptations to which plea-bargaining and defense attorneys may subject them."

<a href="Major">Major</a> Steven E. Walburn argues in a 1998 article in "The Air Force Law Review" that this form of guilty plea should be adopted for usage by the United States military. "In fairness to an accused, if, after consultation with his defense counsel, he knowingly and intelligently determines that his best interest is served by an Alford-type guilty plea, he should be free to choose this path. The system should not force him to lie under oath, nor to go to trial with no promise of the ultimate outcome concerning guilt or punishment. We must trust the accused to make such an important decision for himself. The military provides an accused facing court-martial with a qualified defense attorney. Together, they are in the best position to properly weigh the impact his decision, and the resulting conviction, will have upon himself and his family," writes Walburn. He emphasizes that when allowing these pleas, "trial counsel should establish as strong a factual basis as possible", in order to minimize the possible negative outcomes to "the public's perception of the administration of justice within the military".
Stephanos Bibas writes in a 2003 analysis for "<a href="Cornell%20Law%20Review">Cornell Law Review</a>" that Judge <a href="Frank%20H.%20Easterbrook">Frank H. Easterbrook</a> and a majority of scholars "praise these pleas as efficient, constitutional means of resolving cases". Bibas notes that prominent plea bargain critic Albert Alschuler supports the use of this form of plea, writing, "He views them as a lesser evil, a way to empower defendants within a flawed system. As long as we have plea bargaining, he maintains, innocent defendants should be free to use these pleas to enter advantageous plea bargains without lying. And guilty defendants who are in denial should be empowered to use these pleas instead of being forced to stand trial." Bibas instead asserts that this form of plea is "unwise and should be abolished". Bibas argues, "These procedures may be constitutional and efficient, but they undermine key values served by admissions of guilt in open court. They undermine the procedural values of accuracy and public confidence in accuracy and fairness, by convicting innocent defendants and creating the perception that innocent defendants are being pressured into pleading guilty. More basically, they allow guilty defendants to avoid accepting responsibility for their wrongs."

Legal scholar Jim Drennan, an expert on the court system at the Institute of Government at the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, told the "<a href="Winston-Salem%20Journal">Winston-Salem Journal</a>" in a 2007 interview that the ability to use this form of guilty plea as an option in courts had a far-reaching effect throughout the United States. Drennan commented, "We have lots of laws, but human interaction creates unique circumstances and the law has to adapt." He said of the Supreme Court case, "They had to make a decision about what to do. One of the things the court has to do is figure out how to answer new questions, and that is what happened in this case."

Anti-realism

In <a href="analytic%20philosophy">analytic philosophy</a>, anti-realism is an <a href="Epistemology">epistemological</a> position first articulated by British philosopher <a href="Michael%20Dummett">Michael Dummett</a>. The term was coined as an argument against a form of <a href="Philosophical%20realism">realism</a> Dummett saw as 'colorless reductionism'.

In anti-realism, the truth of a statement rests on its demonstrability through internal logic mechanisms, such as Frege's <a href="context%20principle">context principle</a> and Heyting's <a href="intuitionistic%20logic">intuitionistic logic</a>, in direct opposition to the realist notion that the truth of a statement rests on its correspondence to an external, independent reality. In anti-realism, this external reality is hypothetical and is not assumed.

Because it encompasses statements containing abstract ideal objects (i.e. mathematical objects), anti-realism may apply to a wide range of philosophic topics, from <a href="Physical%20body">material objects</a> to the theoretical entities of <a href="science">science</a>, <a href="mathematical%20object">mathematical statement</a>, <a href="The%20problem%20of%20other%20minds">mental states, events and processes</a>, the <a href="past">past</a> and the <a href="future">future</a>.

The term "anti-realism" was introduced by <a href="Michael%20Dummett">Michael Dummett</a> in his paper "Realism" in order to re-examine a number of classical philosophical disputes, involving such doctrines as <a href="nominalism">nominalism</a>, conceptual realism, <a href="idealism">idealism</a> and <a href="phenomenalism">phenomenalism</a>. The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in portraying these disputes as analogous to the dispute between <a href="intuitionism%20%28philosophy%20of%20mathematics%29">intuitionism</a> and <a href="Platonism">Platonism</a> in the <a href="philosophy%20of%20mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a>.

According to intuitionists (anti-realists with respect to mathematical objects), the <a href="truth">truth</a> of a mathematical statement consists in our ability to prove it. According to Platonic realists, the truth of a statement is proven in its correspondence to <a href="Objectivity%20%28philosophy%29">objective</a> reality. Thus, they are ready to accept a statement of the form "P or Q" as true <a href="Disjunction%20and%20existence%20properties">only if we can prove P or if we can prove Q.</a> In particular, we cannot in general claim that "P or not P" is true (the <a href="law%20of%20Excluded%20Middle">law of Excluded Middle</a>), since in some cases <a href="G%C3%B6del%27s%20incompleteness%20theorems">we may not be able to prove the statement "P" nor prove the statement "not P"</a>. Similarly, intuitionists object to the <a href="existence%20property">existence property</a> for classical logic, where one can prove formula_1, without being able to produce any term formula_2 of which formula_3 holds.

Dummett argues that this notion of truth lies at the bottom of various classical forms of anti-realism, and uses it to re-interpret <a href="phenomenalism">phenomenalism</a>, claiming that it need not take the form of <a href="reductionism">reductionism</a>.

Dummett's writings on anti-realism draw heavily on the later writings of <a href="Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</a>, concerning meaning and rule following, and can be seen as an attempt to integrate central ideas from the "<a href="Philosophical%20Investigations">Philosophical Investigations</a>" into the constructive tradition of <a href="analytic%20philosophy">analytic philosophy</a> deriving from <a href="Frege">Frege</a>.

Idealists maintain a <a href="skepticism">skepticism</a> about the physical world, arguing either: 1) that nothing exists outside the mind, or 2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality, even if it exists. The latter case often takes the form of a denial of the idea that we can have 'unconceptualised' experiences (see <a href="Myth%20of%20the%20Given">Myth of the Given</a>). Conversely, most realists (specifically, <a href="Indirect%20realism">indirect realists</a>) hold that perceptions or <a href="sense%20data">sense data</a> are caused by mind-independent objects. But this introduces the possibility of another kind of skepticism: since our understanding of <a href="causality">causality</a> is that the same effect can be produced by multiple causes, there is a <a href="Indeterminacy%20%28philosophy%29">lack of determinacy</a> about what one is really perceiving, as in the <a href="brain%20in%20a%20vat">brain in a vat</a> scenario.

On a more abstract level, <a href="model%20theory">model theoretic</a> arguments hold that a given set of <a href="symbol">symbol</a>s in a <a href="theory">theory</a> can be mapped onto any number of sets of real-world objects—each set being a "model" of the theory—provided the relationship between the objects is the same. (Compare with <a href="symbol%20grounding">symbol grounding</a>.)

In <a href="philosophy%20of%20science">philosophy of science</a>, anti-realism applies chiefly to claims about the non-reality of "unobservable" <a href="entity">entities</a> such as <a href="electron">electron</a>s or <a href="gene">gene</a>s, which are not detectable with human senses. One prominent position in the philosophy of science is <a href="instrumentalism">instrumentalism</a>, which is a non-realist position which takes a purely agnostic view towards the existence of unobservable entities, in which the unobservable entity X serves as an instrument to aid in the success of theory Y does not require proof for the existence or non-existence of X.

Some scientific anti-realists, however, deny that unobservables exist, even as non-truth conditioned instruments.

In the <a href="philosophy%20of%20mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a>, realism is the claim that mathematical entities such as 'number' have an observer-independent existence. <a href="Mathematical%20empiricism">Empiricism</a>, which associates numbers with concrete physical objects, and <a href="Mathematical%20Platonism">Platonism</a>, in which numbers are abstract, non-physical entities, are the preeminent forms of mathematical realism.

The "<a href="epistemic">epistemic</a> argument" against Platonism has been made by <a href="Paul%20Benacerraf">Paul Benacerraf</a> and <a href="Hartry%20Field">Hartry Field</a>. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are "<a href="abstract%20object">abstract</a>" entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact <a href="causal">causal</a>ly with physical entities ("the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time") Whilst our knowledge of physical objects is based on our ability to <a href="perception">perceive</a> them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.

Field developed his views into <a href="Mathematical%20fictionalism">fictionalism</a>. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of <a href="mathematical%20structuralism">mathematical structuralism</a>, according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.

Anti-realist arguments hinge on the idea that a satisfactory, <a href="Naturalism%20%28philosophy%29">naturalistic</a> account of thought processes can be given for mathematical reasoning. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special <a href="Intuition%20%28knowledge%29">intuition</a> that involves contact with the Platonic realm, as in the argument given by <a href="Sir%20Roger%20Penrose">Sir Roger Penrose</a>.

Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by <a href="Jerrold%20Katz">Jerrold Katz</a> in his book "<a href="Realistic%20Rationalism">Realistic Rationalism</a>".

A more radical defense is to deny the separation of physical world and the platonic world, i.e. the <a href="mathematical%20universe%20hypothesis">mathematical universe hypothesis</a>. In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.

Arsenal Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, England, that plays in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the top flight of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>. The club <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20England%20by%20competitive%20honours%20won">has won</a> 13 <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23Total%20titles%20won">League titles</a>, a record 13 <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, two <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cups</a>, the <a href="Football%20League%20Centenary%20Trophy">League Centenary Trophy</a>, 15 <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>s, one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> and one <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>. It has won the second-most top flight matches in English football history, and is the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">only English club</a> to go a 38-match league season <a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28football%29">unbeaten</a>.

Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, in 1893, and they reached the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">1970–71</a>, they won their first <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">League and FA Cup Double</a>. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.

<a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the <a href="WM%20formation">WM formation</a>, <a href="Floodlight%23Association%20football">floodlights</a>, and <a href="Squad%20number%20%28association%20football%29%23First%20use%20of%20numbers">shirt numbers</a>, and added the white sleeves and brighter red to Arsenal's kit. <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a> has been the longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies. He has won <a href="List%20of%20FA%20Cup%20winning%20managers">a record</a> 7 FA Cups, and his teams set <a href="Football%20records%20in%20England">English records</a> for the longest win streak and longest unbeaten run.

In 1886, <a href="Royal%20Arsenal">Woolwich munitions</a> workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Arsenal Stadium</a> in <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>. They became <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>'s nearest club, commencing the <a href="North%20London%20derby">North London derby</a>. In 2006, they moved down the road to the <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a>. Arsenal earned €435.5m in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2014–15</a>, with the Emirates Stadium generating the highest revenue in world football. Based on social media activity from 2014–15, Arsenal's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world. In 2016, <a href="Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">Forbes estimated</a> the club was the second most valuable in England, worth $2.0 billion.

On 1 December 1886, munitions workers in <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with <a href="David%20Danskin">David Danskin</a> as their first captain. Named after the heart of the <a href="Royal%20Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a> complex, they took the name of the whole complex a month later. Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was <a href="Plumstead%20Common">Plumstead Common</a>, though they spent most of their time in South East London playing on the other side of <a href="Plumstead">Plumstead</a>, at the <a href="Manor%20Ground%20%28Plumstead%29">Manor Ground</a>. Royal Arsenal won Arsenal's first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only <a href="County%20Football%20Association">football association</a> trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.

Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> and winning promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen <a href="Henry%20Norris%20%28businessman%29">Henry Norris</a> and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.

In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Arsenal Stadium</a> in <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, North London. This saw their third change of name: the following year, they reduced Woolwich Arsenal to simply The Arsenal. In 1919, The Football League voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, into the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League">newly enlarged</a> First Division, despite only listing the club sixth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">1914–15</a>. Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious means. Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping "The" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.

With a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's budget grew rapidly. Their location and record-breaking salary offer lured star <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> manager <a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> in 1925. Over the next five years, Chapman built a new Arsenal. He appointed enduring new trainer <a href="Tom%20Whittaker%20%28footballer%29">Tom Whittaker</a>, implemented <a href="Charlie%20Buchan">Charlie Buchan</a>'s new twist on the nascent <a href="WM%20formation">WM formation</a>, captured young players like <a href="Cliff%20Bastin">Cliff Bastin</a> and <a href="Eddie%20Hapgood">Eddie Hapgood</a>, and lavished Highbury's income on stars like <a href="David%20Jack">David Jack</a> and <a href="Alex%20James%20%28footballer%29">Alex James</a>. With record-breaking <a href="World%20football%20transfer%20record">spending</a> and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20club">Bank of England club</a>.

Transformed, Chapman's Arsenal claimed their first national trophy, the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, in <a href="1930%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1930</a>. Two League Championships followed, in <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20Football%20League">1930–31</a> and <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20Football%20League">1932–33</a>. Chapman also presided over multiple off the pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit; <a href="Arsenal%20tube%20station">a Tube station</a> was named after the club; and the first of two opulent, <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football. Suddenly, in the middle of the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a> season, Chapman died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. His work was left to <a href="Joe%20Shaw%20%28footballer%20born%201883%29">Joe Shaw</a> and <a href="George%20Allison">George Allison</a>, who saw out a hat-trick with the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20Football%20League">1933–34</a> and <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20Football%20League">1934–35</a> titles, and then won the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20FA%20Cup">1936 FA Cup</a> and <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Football%20League">1937–38</a> title.

<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> meant The Football League was suspended for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20Football%20League">1947–48</a>. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23List">champions of England record</a>. They won a third FA Cup in <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20FA%20Cup">1950</a>, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20Football%20League">1952–53</a>. However, the war had taken its toll on Arsenal. The club had had more players killed than any top flight club, and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal's resources.

Arsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad was old, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements. Although Arsenal were competitive during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in midleague mediocrity. Even former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> captain <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.

Arsenal tentatively appointed club <a href="physiotherapist">physiotherapist</a> <a href="Bertie%20Mee">Bertie Mee</a> as acting manager in 1966. With new assistant <a href="Don%20Howe">Don Howe</a> and new players such as <a href="Bob%20McNab">Bob McNab</a> and <a href="George%20Graham%20%28footballer%29">George Graham</a>, Mee led Arsenal to their first <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> finals, in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Football%20League%20Cup">1967–68</a> and <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Football%20League%20Cup">1968–69</a>. Next season saw a breakthrough: Arsenal's first competitive European trophy, the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>. And <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">the season after</a>, an even greater triumph: Arsenal's first <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Football%20League">League</a> and <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a>, and a new <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23List">champions of England record</a>. This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the rest of the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20FA%20Cup">1972</a>, and First Division runners-up in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Football%20League">1972–73</a>.

Former player <a href="Terry%20Neill">Terry Neill</a> succeeded Mee in 1976. At the age of 34, he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a> and <a href="Pat%20Jennings">Pat Jennings</a>, and a crop of talent in the side such as <a href="Liam%20Brady">Liam Brady</a> and <a href="Frank%20Stapleton">Frank Stapleton</a>, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (<a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20FA%20Cup">1978</a>, <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20FA%20Cup">1979</a> and <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20FA%20Cup">1980</a>), and lost the <a href="1980%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final</a> on <a href="penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>. The club's only trophy during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the <a href="1979%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1979 FA Cup Final</a>, widely regarded as a classic.

One of Bertie Mee's double winners, <a href="George%20Graham%20%28footballer%29">George Graham</a>, returned as manager in 1986. Arsenal won their first League Cup in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Football%20League%20Cup">1987</a>, Graham's first season in charge. By 1988, new signings <a href="Nigel%20Winterburn">Nigel Winterburn</a>, <a href="Lee%20Dixon">Lee Dixon</a> and <a href="Steve%20Bould">Steve Bould</a> had joined the club to complete the "famous Back Four" led by existing player <a href="Tony%20Adams">Tony Adams</a>. They immediately won the 1988 <a href="Football%20League%20Centenary%20Trophy">Football League Centenary Trophy</a>, and followed it with the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League">1988–89 Football League</a> title, snatched with a last-minute goal in the <a href="Liverpool%200%E2%80%932%20Arsenal%20%2826%20May%201989%29">final game of the season</a> against fellow title challengers <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Graham's Arsenal won another title in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Football%20League">1990–91</a>, losing only one match, won the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> double in 1993, and the <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1994</a>. Graham's reputation was tarnished when he was found to have taken kickbacks from agent <a href="Rune%20Hauge">Rune Hauge</a> for signing certain players, and he was dismissed in 1995. His permanent replacement, <a href="Bruce%20Rioch">Bruce Rioch</a>, lasted for only one season, leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors.

The club metamorphosed during the long tenure of manager <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a>, appointed in 1996. New, attacking football, an overhaul of dietary and fitness practices, and efficiency with money have defined his reign. Accumulating key players from Wenger's homeland, such as <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a> and <a href="Thierry%20Henry">Thierry Henry</a>, Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">1997–98</a> and a third in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2001–02</a>. In addition, the club reached the final of the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Cup">1999–2000 UEFA Cup</a>, were victorious in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Cup">2003</a> and <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Cup">2005</a> FA Cups, and won the Premier League in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Premier%20League">2003–04</a> without losing a single match, an achievement which earned the side the nickname "<a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28football%29">The Invincibles</a>". This latter feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004, a <a href="Football%20records%20in%20England">national record</a>.

Arsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wenger's first nine seasons at the club, although on no occasion were they able to retain the title. The club had never progressed beyond the quarter-finals of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> until <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2005–06</a>; in that season they became the first club from London in the competition's fifty-year history to reach <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">the final</a>, in which they were beaten 2–1 by <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. In July 2006, they moved into the <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a>, after 93 years at Highbury. Arsenal reached the final of the <a href="2007%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2007</a> and <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2011</a> League Cups, losing 2–1 to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> respectively.

The club had not gained a major trophy since the 2005 FA Cup until 17 May 2014, when Arsenal beat <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> in the <a href="2014%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2014 FA Cup Final</a>, coming back from a 2–0 deficit to win the match 3–2. A year later, Arsenal appeared in the FA Cup final for the second time in a row, defeating <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> 4–0 in the <a href="2015%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> and becoming the most successful club in the tournament's history with 12 titles, a record which Manchester United would tie the following season. Arsenal later won the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for a record 13th time, defeating Chelsea 2–1 in the <a href="2017%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2017 final</a> and once more becoming the outright leader in terms of FA Cups won. The victory also saw Wenger become the first manager in English football history to win seven FA Cups. However, in that same season, Arsenal finished in the fifth position in the league, the first time they had finished outside the top four since before Wenger arrived in 1996.
Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first <a href="crest%20%28sports%29">crest</a> featured three <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Woolwich">Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich</a> (nowadays transferred to the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20Royal%20Borough%20of%20Greenwich">coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich</a>). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a <a href="cascabel%20%28artillery%29">cascabel</a> on each are clear indicators that they are cannons. This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, "The Gunners", inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.

In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club's name, set in <a href="blackletter">blackletter</a>, and above the coat of arms of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Islington">Metropolitan Borough of Islington</a> and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted Latin <a href="motto">motto</a>, "Victoria Concordia Crescit -" "victory comes from harmony" – coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer. For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to <a href="copyright">copyright</a> it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold "unofficial" Arsenal merchandise, Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable. The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a <a href="sans-serif">sans-serif</a> typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.
Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a <a href="monogram">monogram</a> of the club's initials in red on a white background.

The monogram theme was developed into an <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors. From 1967, a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts, until replaced by the club crest, sometimes with the addition of the nickname "The Gunners", in the 1990s.

In the 2011–12 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all white, surrounded by 15 <a href="oak">oak</a> leaves to the right and 15 <a href="Laurel%20wreath">laurel</a> leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto "Forward" at the bottom of the crest.

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, <a href="Fred%20Beardsley">Fred Beardsley</a> and <a href="Morris%20Bates">Morris Bates</a>, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.
In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter <a href="pillar%20box">pillar box</a> red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist <a href="Tom%20Webster%20%28cartoonist%29">Tom Webster</a>, with whom Chapman played golf.
Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season. In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, <a href="AC%20Sparta%20Prague">Sparta Prague</a> adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, <a href="Hibernian%20F.C.">Hibernian</a> adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip. In 1920, <a href="S.C.%20Braga">Sporting Clube de Braga</a>'s manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of "Os Arsenalistas". These teams still wear those designs to this day.

For many years Arsenal's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the <a href="1971%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1971 FA Cup Final</a> as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> for the first time in their history. Arsenal reached the <a href="1972%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a> again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between <a href="1978%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1978</a> and <a href="1980%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1980</a> wearing their "lucky" yellow and blue strip, which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.

When <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> took over from <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> as Arsenal's kit provider in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.
Until 2014, the away kit was changed every season, and the outgoing away kit became the third-choice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year. Since <a href="Puma%20SE">Puma</a> began manufacturing Arsenal's kits in 2014, new home, away and third kits are released every single season.

Arsenal's shirts have been made by manufacturers including <a href="Bukta">Bukta</a> (from the 1930s until the early 1970s), <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> (from the 1970s until 1986), <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> (1986–1994), <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> (1994–2014), and <a href="Puma%20SE">Puma</a> (from 2014). Like those of most other major football clubs, Arsenal's shirts have featured sponsors' logos since the 1980s; sponsors include <a href="JVC">JVC</a> (1982–1999), <a href="Sega">Sega</a> (1999–2002), <a href="Telef%C3%B3nica%20Europe">O2</a> (2002–2006), and <a href="Emirates%20%28airline%29">Emirates</a> (from 2006).

Before joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on <a href="Plumstead%20Common">Plumstead Common</a>, then at the <a href="Manor%20Ground%2C%20Plumstead">Manor Ground</a> in <a href="Plumstead">Plumstead</a>, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby <a href="Invicta%20Ground">Invicta Ground</a>. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and <a href="terrace%20%28stadium%29">terracing</a>, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.

Widely referred to as Highbury, <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Arsenal Stadium</a> was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a>, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing. The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.

Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.
Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> and the other three stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.
After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a>, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury.
The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs,
and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006–07 season.
The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company <a href="Emirates%20%28airline%29">Emirates</a>, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100 million.
Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names.
The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until the end of the 2018–19 season. From the start of the 2010–11 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end.

Arsenal's players train at the <a href="Shenley%20Training%20Centre">Shenley Training Centre</a> in Hertfordshire, a purpose-built facility which opened in 1999. Before that the club used facilities on a nearby site owned by the <a href="University%20College%20London%20Union">University College of London Students' Union</a>. Until 1961 they had trained at Highbury. Arsenal's <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%20Academy">Academy under-18</a> teams play their home matches at Shenley, while the <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%20Reserves">reserves</a> play their games at <a href="Meadow%20Park%20%28Borehamwood%29">Meadow Park</a>, which is also the home of <a href="Borehamwood%20F.C.">Boreham Wood F.C.</a>.

Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as "Gooners", the name derived from the team's nickname, "The Gunners". The fanbase is large and generally loyal, and virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity), and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance. Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, and <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke</a>. The club's location, adjoining wealthy areas such as <a href="Canonbury">Canonbury</a> and <a href="Barnsbury">Barnsbury</a>, mixed areas such as <a href="Islington">Islington</a>, <a href="Holloway%2C%20London">Holloway</a>, <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, and the adjacent <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Camden">London Borough of Camden</a>, and largely working-class areas such as <a href="Finsbury%20Park%2C%20London">Finsbury Park</a> and <a href="Stoke%20Newington">Stoke Newington</a>, has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from a variety of social classes. Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Hackney">London Borough of Hackney</a> and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from <a href="Wembley%20Park">Wembley Park</a>, North West of the capital. There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the nearby <a href="Archway">Archway</a> area having a particularly large community, but Irish migration to North London is much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.
Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The <a href="Arsenal%20Supporters%27%20Trust">Arsenal Supporters' Trust</a> promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s such as "The Gooner", "Gunflash" and the satirical "Up The Arse!". In addition to the usual English <a href="football%20chant">football chant</a>s, supporters sing "One-Nil to the Arsenal" (to the tune of "<a href="Go%20West%20%28song%29">Go West</a>").

There have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club. A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 113 million. The club's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.

Arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours, <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>; matches between the two are referred to as <a href="North%20London%20derby">North London derbies</a>. Other rivalries within London include those with <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> and <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>. In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in recent years when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title – so much so that a 2003 <a href="online%20poll">online poll</a> by the <a href="Football%20Fans%20Census">Football Fans Census</a> listed Manchester United as Arsenal's biggest rivals, followed by Tottenham and Chelsea. A 2008 poll listed the Tottenham rivalry as more important.

The largest shareholder on the Arsenal board is American sports tycoon <a href="Stan%20Kroenke">Stan Kroenke</a>. Kroenke first launched a bid for the club in April 2007, and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares off <a href="David%20Dein">David Dein</a> in August 2007. Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire <a href="Alisher%20Usmanov">Alisher Usmanov</a> and Iranian London-based financier <a href="Farhad%20Moshiri%20%28businessman%29">Farhad Moshiri</a>, though Usmanov bought Moshiri's stake in 2016. Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%). In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of <a href="Nina%20Bracewell-Smith">Nina Bracewell-Smith</a> and <a href="Danny%20Fiszman">Danny Fiszman</a>, taking his shareholding to 62.89%. As of May 2017, Kroenke owns 41,721 shares (67.05%) and Red & White Securities own 18,695 shares (30.04%). <a href="Ivan%20Gazidis">Ivan Gazidis</a> has been the club's Chief Executive since 2009.

Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as a <a href="financial%20quote">non-quoted</a> <a href="public%20limited%20company">public limited company</a>, whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the <a href="FTSE%20Group">FTSE</a> or <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">AIM</a>; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the <a href="ICAP%20%28company%29">ICAP</a> Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a <a href="mid%20price">mid price</a> of £18,000, which sets the club's <a href="market%20capitalisation">market capitalisation</a> value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants <a href="Brand%20Finance">Brand Finance</a> valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand. Business magazine <a href="Forbes">Forbes</a> <a href="Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">valued</a> Arsenal as a whole at $2.0 billion (£1.4 billion) in 2016, ranked second in English football. Research by the <a href="Henley%20Business%20School">Henley Business School</a> also ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015.

Arsenal's financial results for the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2014–15</a> season show group revenue of £344.5m, with a profit before tax of £24.7m. The footballing core of the business showed a revenue of £329.3m. The <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">Deloitte Football Money League</a> is a publication that homogenizes and compares clubs' annual revenue. They put Arsenal's footballing revenue at £331.3m (€435.5m), ranking Arsenal seventh among world football clubs. Arsenal and <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a> both list the match day revenue generated by the Emirates Stadium as £100.4m, more than any other football stadium in the world.

Arsenal have appeared in a number of media "firsts". On 22 January 1927, their match at Highbury against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> was the first English League match to be broadcast live on radio. A decade later, on 16 September 1937, an exhibition match between Arsenal's first team and the reserves was the first football match in the world to be televised live. Arsenal also featured in the first edition of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Match%20of%20the%20Day">Match of the Day</a>", which screened highlights of their match against Liverpool at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> on 22 August 1964. <a href="British%20Sky%20Broadcasting">BSkyB</a>'s coverage of Arsenal's January 2010 match against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> was the first live public broadcast of a sports event on <a href="3D%20television">3D television</a>.

As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related novels, "The Arsenal Stadium Mystery" (1939), which was <a href="The%20Arsenal%20Stadium%20Mystery">made into a film</a> in the same year. The story centres on a <a href="friendly%20match">friendly match</a> between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves in the film and manager <a href="George%20Allison">George Allison</a> was given a speaking part. More recently, the book "<a href="Fever%20Pitch">Fever Pitch</a>" by <a href="Nick%20Hornby">Nick Hornby</a> was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was twice adapted for the cinema – the <a href="Fever%20Pitch%20%281997%20film%29">1997 British film</a> focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a <a href="Fever%20Pitch%20%282005%20film%29">2005 American version</a> features a fan of baseball's <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>.

Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a <a href="defender%20%28association%20football%29">defensive</a> and "boring" side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s; many comedians, such as <a href="Eric%20Morecambe">Eric Morecambe</a>, made jokes about this at the team's expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film "<a href="The%20Full%20Monty">The Full Monty</a>", in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's <a href="offside%20trap">offside trap</a>, in an attempt to co-ordinate their <a href="striptease">striptease</a> routine. Another film reference to the club's defence comes in the film "<a href="Plunkett%20%26amp%3B%20Macleane">Plunkett & Macleane</a>", in which two characters are named Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenal's long-serving full backs – the right-sided <a href="Lee%20Dixon">Lee Dixon</a> and the left-sided <a href="Nigel%20Winterburn">Nigel Winterburn</a>.

In 1985, Arsenal founded a <a href="corporate%20social%20responsibility">community scheme</a>, "Arsenal in the Community", which offered sporting, <a href="social%20inclusion">social inclusion</a>, educational and charitable projects. The club support a number of charitable causes directly and in 1992 established The Arsenal Charitable Trust, which by 2006 had raised more than £2 million for local causes. An ex-professional and celebrity football team associated with the club also raised money by playing charity matches.

In the 2009–10 season Arsenal announced that they had raised a record breaking £818,897 for the <a href="Great%20Ormond%20Street%20Hospital%20Children%27s%20Charity">Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity</a>. The original target was £500,000.

<a href="Save%20the%20Children">Save the Children</a> has been Arsenal global charity partner since 2011 and have worked together in numerous projects to improve safety and well-being for vulnerable children in London and abroad. On 3 September 2016 The Arsenal Foundation has donated £1m to build football pitches for children in London, Iraq, Jordan and Somalia thanks to The Arsenal Foundation Legends Match against Milan Glorie at the Emirates Stadium.

Arsenal's tally of 13 League Championships is the third highest in English football, after Manchester United (20) and Liverpool (18),
and they were the first club <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23Football%20League%20First%20Division%20%281892%E2%80%931992%29">to reach</a> a seventh and an eighth League Championship. As of May 2016, they are one of only six teams, the others being Manchester United, <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> and <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>, to have won the Premier League since its formation in 1992.

They hold the highest number of FA Cup trophies, with 13. The club is one of only six clubs to have won the FA Cup twice in succession, in 2002 and 2003, and 2014 and 2015. Arsenal have achieved three League and FA Cup "<a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">Doubles</a>" (in 1971, 1998 and 2002), a feat only previously achieved by Manchester United (in 1994, 1996 and 1999). They were the first side in English football to complete the FA Cup and League Cup double, in 1993. Arsenal were also the first London club to reach the final of the UEFA Champions League, in 2006, losing the final 2–1 to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>.

Arsenal have one of the best top-flight records in history, having finished below fourteenth only seven times. They have won the second most top flight league matches in English football, and have also accumulated the second most points, whether calculated by two points per win or by the contemporary points value. They have been in the top flight for the most consecutive seasons (92 as of 2017–18). Arsenal also have the highest average league finishing position for the 20th century, with an average league placement of 8.5.

Arsenal hold the record for the longest run of unbeaten League matches (49 between May 2003 and October 2004). This included all 38 matches of their title-winning <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season, when Arsenal became only the second club to finish a top-flight campaign unbeaten, after <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> (who played only 22 matches) in <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1888–89</a>. They also hold the record for the longest top flight win streak.

Arsenal set a Champions League record during the 2005–06 season by going ten matches without conceding a goal, beating the previous best of seven set by <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a>. They went a record total stretch of 995 minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak ended in <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">the final</a>, when <a href="Samuel%20Eto%27o">Samuel Eto'o</a> scored a 76th-minute equaliser for Barcelona.

<a href="David%20O%27Leary">David O'Leary</a> holds the record for Arsenal appearances, having played 722 first-team matches between 1975 and 1993. Fellow <a href="centre%20half">centre half</a> and former captain <a href="Tony%20Adams%20%28footballer%29">Tony Adams</a> comes second, having played 669 times. The record for a <a href="goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> is held by <a href="David%20Seaman">David Seaman</a>, with 564 appearances.

<a href="Thierry%20Henry">Thierry Henry</a> is the club's top goalscorer with 228 goals in all competitions between 1999 and 2012, having surpassed <a href="Ian%20Wright">Ian Wright</a>'s total of 185 in October 2005. Wright's record had stood since September 1997, when he overtook the longstanding total of 178 goals set by winger <a href="Cliff%20Bastin">Cliff Bastin</a> in 1939. Henry also holds the club record for goals scored in the League, with 175, a record that had been held by Bastin until February 2006.

Arsenal's record home attendance is 73,707, for a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> match against <a href="RC%20Lens">RC Lens</a> on 25 November 1998 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, where the club formerly played home European matches because of the limits on Highbury's capacity. The record attendance for an Arsenal match at Highbury is 73,295, for a 0–0 draw against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> on 9 March 1935, while that at Emirates Stadium is 60,161, for a 2–2 draw with Manchester United on 3 November 2007.

There have been eighteen permanent and five <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a>s of Arsenal since the appointment of the club's first professional manager, <a href="Thomas%20Mitchell%20%28football%20manager%29">Thomas Mitchell</a> in 1897. The club's longest-serving manager, in terms of both length of tenure and number of games overseen, is <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a>, who was appointed in 1996. Wenger is also Arsenal's only manager from outside the United Kingdom. Two Arsenal managers have died in the job – <a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> and <a href="Tom%20Whittaker%20%28footballer%29">Tom Whittaker</a>.

As of 28 May 2017. Seasons in bold are seasons when the club won a <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">Double</a> of the league and FA Cup, or of the FA Cup and League Cup. The "<a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2003–04</a>" season was the only 38-match league season <a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28football%29">unbeaten</a> in English football history. A special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season.








When the FA Cup was the only national <a href="football%20association">football association</a> competition available to Arsenal, the other football association competitions were <a href="County%20Football%20Association">County Cups</a>, and they made up many of the competitive matches the club played during a season. Arsenal's first first-team trophy was a County Cup, the inaugural <a href="Kent%20Senior%20Cup">Kent Senior Cup</a>. Arsenal became ineligible for the <a href="London%20Football%20Association">London Cups</a> when the club turned professional in 1891, and rarely participated in County Cups after this. Due to the club's original location within the borders of both the London and <a href="Kent%20County%20Football%20Association">Kent</a> Football Associations, Arsenal competed in and won trophies organized by each.

<a href="Arsenal%20Women%20F.C.">Arsenal Women</a> are the women's football club affiliated to Arsenal. Founded as Arsenal Ladies F.C. in 1987 by <a href="Vic%20Akers">Vic Akers</a>, they turned <a href="semi-professional">semi-professional</a> in 2002 and are currently managed by Clair Wheatley. Akers currently holds the role of Honorary President of Arsenal Women. As part of the festivities surrounding their 30th anniversary in 2017, the club announced that they were changing their formal name to Arsenal Women F.C., and would use "Arsenal" in all references except rare cases where there might be confusion with the men's side.

Arsenal Women are the most successful team in <a href="Women%27s%20football%20in%20England">English women's football</a>. In the 2008–09 season, they won all three major English trophies – the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Premier%20League">FA Women's Premier League</a>, <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Cup">FA Women's Cup</a> and <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Premier%20League%20Cup">FA Women's Premier League Cup</a>, and, as of 2017, were the only English side to have won the UEFA Women's Cup or <a href="UEFA%20Women%27s%20Champions%20League">UEFA Women's Champions League</a>, having won the Cup in the 2006–07 season as part of a unique <a href="The%20Quadruple%23Women%27s%20Football">quadruple</a>. The men's and women's clubs are formally separate entities but have quite close ties; Arsenal Women are entitled to play once a season at the Emirates Stadium, though they usually play their home matches at <a href="Boreham%20Wood%20F.C.">Boreham Wood</a>. At present the women have won 46 trophies in their 30-year history.
