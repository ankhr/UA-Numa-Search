Archery

Archery is the sport, practice or skill of using a <a href="Bow%20%28weapon%29">bow</a> to <a href="Propulsion">propel</a> <a href="arrow">arrow</a>s. The word comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "arcus". Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat. In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity. A person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a "bowman", and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite.

The bow and arrow seems to have been invented in the later <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> or early <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> periods. The oldest signs of its use in Europe come from the in the north of <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, Germany and dates from the late <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a>, about 10,000–9000 BC. The arrows were made of <a href="pine">pine</a> and consisted of a mainshaft and a long fore shaft with a <a href="flint">flint</a> point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by <a href="spear-thrower">spear-thrower</a>s rather than bows. The <a href="Holmegaard%20bow">oldest bows</a> known so far come from the <a href="Holmegaard">Holmegård</a> swamp in Denmark. Bows eventually replaced the <a href="spear-thrower">spear-thrower</a> as the predominant means for launching shafted <a href="projectiles">projectiles</a>, on every continent except <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>, though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico and among the <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a>.

Bows and arrows have been present in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian culture since its <a href="Predynastic%20Egypt">predynastic</a> origins. In the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, artifacts that could be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the <a href="Natufian%20culture">Natufian culture</a>, (c. 10,800–8,300 BC) onwards. The <a href="Khiamian">Khiamian</a> and <a href="Pre-Pottery%20Neolithic%20A">PPN A</a> shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.

<a href="Classical%20antiquity">Classical</a> civilizations, notably the <a href="ancient%20Assyrians">Assyrians</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Armenia">Armenians</a>, <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persians</a>, <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>ns, <a href="History%20of%20India">Indians</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Korea">Koreans</a>, <a href="History%20of%20China">Chinese</a>, and <a href="History%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadians</a> were the first to use composite bows in war according to the victory stele of <a href="Naram-Sin%20of%20Akkad">Naram-Sin of Akkad</a>. Egyptians used composite bows for warfare already from the 16th Century BC while the Bronze Age Aegean Cultures were able to deploy a number of state-owned specialised bowmakers for warfare and hunting purposes already from the 15th century BC. The <a href="Welsh%20longbow">Welsh longbow</a> proved its worth for the first time in Continental warfare at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Battle of Crécy</a>. In the Americas archery was widespread at European contact.

Archery was highly developed in <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. The <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> term for archery, <a href="dhanurveda">dhanurveda</a>, came to refer to martial arts in general. In East Asia, <a href="Goguryeo">Goguryeo</a>, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.

Central Asian <a href="tribesmen">tribesmen</a> (after the <a href="domestication%20of%20the%20horse">domestication of the horse</a>) and American <a href="Plains%20Indians">Plains Indians</a> (after gaining access to horses) became extremely adept at <a href="Mounted%20archery">archery on horseback</a>. Lightly armoured, but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the Central Asian steppes, and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of Eurasia. Shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback, and the <a href="composite%20bow">composite bow</a> enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons. Empires throughout the Eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective "barbarian" counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow, to the point where powerful states like the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> referred to their neighbours, the <a href="Xiong-nu">Xiong-nu</a>, as "Those Who Draw the Bow". For example, Xiong-nu mounted bowmen made them more than a match for the Han military, and their threat was at least partially responsible for Chinese expansion into the Ordos region, to create a stronger, more powerful buffer zone against them. It is possible that "barbarian" peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their "civilized" counterparts—the Xiong-nu and the Han being one example. Similarly, short bows seem to have been introduced to Japan by northeast Asian groups.

The development of <a href="Gunpowder%20warfare">firearms</a> rendered bows obsolete in warfare, albeit efforts were sometimes made to preserve archery practice. In Wales and England, for example, the government tried to enforce practice with the Longbow until the end of the 16th century. This was because it was recognised that the bow had been instrumental to military success during the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Armenia, China, Egypt, England and Wales, <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">America</a>, India, Japan, Korea, Turkey and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the neglect of archery. Early firearms were inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very susceptible to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armour without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield. However, the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon, and archers have seen action in the 21st century. Traditional archery remains in use for sport, and for hunting in many areas.

Early recreational archery societies included the Finsbury Archers and the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers. The latter's annual <a href="Popinjay%20%28sport%29">Papingo</a> event was first recorded in 1483. (In this event, archers shoot vertically from the base of an abbey tower to dislodge a wood pigeon placed approximately 30 meters above.) The Royal Company of Archers was formed in 1676 and is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the world. Archery remained a small and scattered pastime, however, until the late 18th century when it experienced a fashionable revival among the <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a>. Sir <a href="Ashton%20Lever">Ashton Lever</a>, an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, with the patronage of <a href="George%20III">George, the Prince of Wales</a>.

Archery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes. Recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility, complete with flags, music and <a href="21%20gun%20salute">21 gun salute</a>s for the competitors. The clubs were "the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside" and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of the local upper class. As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females. Young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so. Thus, archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance. It was often consciously styled in the manner of a <a href="Medieval">Medieval</a> <a href="tournament">tournament</a> with titles and <a href="laurel%20wreath">laurel wreath</a>s being presented as a reward to the victor. General meetings were held from 1789, in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies. Archery was also co-opted as a distinctively British tradition, dating back to the lore of <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a> and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. The societies were also elitist, and the new <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status.

After the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the sport became increasingly popular among all classes, and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the <a href="Industrialisation">preindustrial</a> rural Britain. Particularly influential was Sir <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a>'s 1819 novel, "<a href="Ivanhoe">Ivanhoe</a>" that depicted the heroic character Lockseley winning an archery tournament.

The 1840s saw the second attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport. The first <a href="Grand%20National%20Archery%20Society">Grand National Archery Society</a> meeting was held in <a href="York">York</a> in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardised as the 'York Round' - a series of shoots at 60, 80, and 100 yards. <a href="Horace%20A.%20Ford">Horace A. Ford</a> helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques. He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.
Towards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as <a href="croquet">croquet</a> and <a href="tennis">tennis</a> became more popular among the middle class. By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the <a href="1900%20Paris%20Olympics">1900 Paris Olympics</a>.

In the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century. The last of the <a href="Yahi%23Yahi">Yahi Indian</a> tribe, a native known as <a href="Ishi">Ishi</a>, came out of hiding in California in 1911. His doctor, <a href="Saxton%20Pope">Saxton Pope</a>, learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them. 

From the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts. They led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern <a href="recurve%20bow">recurve</a> and <a href="compound%20bow">compound bow</a>. These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority. In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding. Much of this expertise is available in the "Traditional Bowyer's Bibles" (see Additional reading). Modern game archery owes much of its success to <a href="Fred%20Bear">Fred Bear</a>, an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer.

Deities and heroes in several mythologies are described as archers, including the Greek <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> and <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, the Roman <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a> and <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a>, the Germanic <a href="Agilaz">Agilaz</a>, continuing in legends like those of <a href="Wilhelm%20Tell">Wilhelm Tell</a>, <a href="Palnetoke">Palnetoke</a>, or <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a>. Armenian <a href="Hayk">Hayk</a> and Babylonian <a href="Marduk">Marduk</a>, Indian <a href="Karna">Karna</a> (also known as Radheya/son of Radha), <a href="Abhimanyu">Abhimanyu</a>, <a href="Eklavya">Eklavya</a>, <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a>, <a href="Bhishma">Bhishma</a>, <a href="Drona">Drona</a>, <a href="Rama">Rama</a>, and <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> were known for their shooting skills. The famous archery competition of hitting the eye of a rotating fish while watching its reflection in the water bowl was one of the many archery skills depicted in the <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>. 
<a href="http%3A//images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/digital-illustration-of-skilled-archer-arjuna-aiming-arrow-at-fish-hung-from-revolving-wheel-above-h-dorling-kindersley.jpg"></a>
Persian <a href="Arash%20%28mythology%29">Arash</a> was a famous archer. Earlier Greek representations of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> normally depict him as an archer.

The Nymphai Hyperboreioi (Νύμφαι Ὑπερβόρειοι) were worshipped on the Greek island of Delos as attendants of <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, presiding over aspects of archery; Hekaerge (Ἑκαέργη), represented distancing, Loxo (Λοξώ), trajectory, and Oupis (Οὖπις), aim.

<a href="Houyi">Yi the archer</a> and his apprentice <a href="Feng%20Meng">Feng Meng</a> appear in several early Chinese myths, and the historical character of <a href="Zhou%20Tong%20%28archer%29">Zhou Tong</a> features in many fictional forms. <a href="Jumong">Jumong</a>, the first <a href="Taewang">Taewang</a> of the <a href="Goguryeo">Goguryeo</a> kingdom of the <a href="Three%20Kingdoms%20of%20Korea">Three Kingdoms of Korea</a>, is claimed by legend to have been a near-godlike archer. Archery features in the story of Oguz Khagan.

In <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>n <a href="Yoruba%20religion">Yoruba</a> belief, <a href="Ochosi">Osoosi</a> is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery.

While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.

Directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being <a href="self%20bow">self bow</a>s, <a href="laminated%20bow">laminated bow</a>s and <a href="composite%20bow">composite bow</a>s. Bows can also be classified by the <a href="shape">bow shape</a> of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to traditional European straight bows, a <a href="Recurve%20bow%23Recurve%20bow">recurve bow</a> and some types of Longbow have tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. The cross-section of the limb also varies; the classic <a href="longbow">longbow</a> is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are D-shaped in cross section, and the <a href="flatbow">flatbow</a> has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross-section. The classic D-shape comes from the use of the wood of the yew tree. The sap-wood is best suited to the tension on the back of the bow, and the heart-wood to the compression on the belly. Hence, a cross-section of a yew longbow shows the narrow, light-coloured sap-wood on the 'straight' part (riser) of the D, and the red/orange heartwood forms the curved part of the D, to balance the mechanical tension/compression stress. <a href="Cable-backed%20bow">Cable-backed bow</a>s use cords as the back of the bow; the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable. They were widespread among <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> who lacked easy access to good bow wood. One variety of cable-backed bow is the Penobscot bow or <a href="Wabenaki">Wabenaki</a> bow, invented by Frank Loring (Chief Big Thunder) about 1900. It consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.

In different cultures, the arrows are released from either the left or right side of the bow, and this affects the hand grip and position of the bow. In <a href="Arab%20archery">Arab archery</a>, <a href="Turkish%20archery">Turkish archery</a> and <a href="Ky%C5%ABd%C5%8D">Kyūdō</a>, the arrows are released from the right hand side of the bow, and this affects construction of the bow. In western archery, the arrow is usually released from the left hand side of the bow.

<a href="Compound%20bow">Compound bow</a>s are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this. A typical let-off is anywhere from 65% to 80%. For example, a 60-pound bow with 80% let-off only requires 12 pounds of force to hold at full draw. Up to 99% let-off is possible. The compound bow was invented by <a href="Holless%20Wilbur%20Allen">Holless Wilbur Allen</a> in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America.

Mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the <a href="crossbow">crossbow</a>. Crossbows typically have shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows. Because of this, heavier draw weights are required to achieve the same energy transfer to the arrow. These mechanically drawn bows also have devices to hold the tension when the bow is fully drawn. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s.

The most common form of arrow consists of a <a href="Arrow%20straightener">shaft</a>, with an <a href="arrowhead">arrowhead</a> at the front end, and <a href="fletching">fletching</a>s and a <a href="Arrow%23Nocks">nock</a> at the other end. Arrows across time and history have normally been carried in a container known as a <a href="quiver">quiver</a>, which can take many different forms. Shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid <a href="wood">wood</a>, <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>, <a href="glass-reinforced%20plastic">fiberglass</a>, <a href="aluminium%20alloy">aluminium alloy</a>, <a href="carbon%20fiber">carbon fiber</a>, or <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a>s. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily. Aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century, due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s because they are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows. Today, the most popular arrows at tournaments and Olympic events are made of composite materials, in particular the X10 and A/C/E, made by <a href="Easton%20%28company%29">Easton</a>,

The arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but separate arrowheads are far more common, usually made from metal, stone, or other hard materials. The most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.
<a href="Fletching">Fletching</a> is traditionally made from bird feathers, but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though as many as six have been used. Two makes the arrow unstable in flight. When the arrow is "three-fletched", the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes. This fletch is called the "index fletch" or "cock feather" (also known as "the odd vane out" or "the nocking vane"), and the others are sometimes called the "hen feathers". Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision. When an arrow is "four-fletched", two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.

The fletching may be either "parabolic" cut (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or "shield" cut (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield), and is often attached at an angle, known as "helical" fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight. Whether helicial or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) is used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird. Oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called "<a href="flu-flu%20arrow">flu-flus</a>". Misplacement of fletchings can change the arrow's flight path dramatically.

<a href="Dacron">Dacron</a> and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows. Linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows. Several modern methods of making a bow string exist, such as the 'endless loop' and 'Flemish twist'. Almost any fiber can be made into a bow string. The author of "Arab Archery" suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel. <a href="Nj%C3%A1l%27s%20saga">Njál's saga</a> describes the refusal of a wife, Hallgerður, to cut her hair to make an emergency bowstring for her husband, <a href="Gunnar%20H%C3%A1mundarson">Gunnar Hámundarson</a>, who is then killed.

Most archers wear a <a href="bracer%20%28archery%29">bracer</a> (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bow string. The bracer does not brace the arm; the word comes from the armoury term "<a href="brassard">brassard</a>", meaning an armoured sleeve or badge. The <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo people</a> have developed highly ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment. Some archers (nearly all archers ) wear protection on their chests, called chestguards or plastrons. The myth of the <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a> was that they had one breast removed to solve this problem. <a href="Roger%20Ascham">Roger Ascham</a> mentions one archer, presumably with an unusual shooting style, who wore a leather guard for his face.

The drawing digits are normally protected by a leather <a href="finger%20tab">tab</a>, glove, or <a href="thumb%20ring">thumb ring</a>. A simple tab of leather is commonly used, as is a skeleton glove. Medieval Europeans probably used a complete leather glove.

Eurasiatic archers who used the thumb or Mongolian draw protected their thumbs, usually with leather according to the author of "Arab Archery", but also with <a href="thumb%20ring">special rings</a> of various hard materials. Many surviving Turkish and Chinese examples are works of considerable art. Some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow. Possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time. In traditional <a href="Ky%C5%ABd%C5%8D">Japanese archery</a> a special <a href="yugake">glove</a> is used that has a ridge to assist in drawing the string.

A release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow. In the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer's hand or attached to their wrist. In another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.

Stabilizers are mounted at various points on the bow. Common with competitive archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to be mounted at various angles to fine tune the bow's balance.

Stabilizers aid in aiming by improving the balance of the bow. Sights, quivers, rests, and riser design make one side of the bow heavier. One purpose of stabilizers are to offset these forces. A reflex riser design will cause the top limb to lean towards the shooter. In this case a heavier front stabilizer is desired to offset this action. A deflex riser design has the opposite effect and a lighter front stabilizer may be used.

Stabilizers can reduce noise and vibration. These energies are absorbed by viscoelastic polymers, gels, powders, and other materials used to build stabilizers.

Stabilizers improve the forgiveness and accuracy by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow to resist movement during the shooting process. Lightweight carbon stabilizers with weighted ends are desirable because they improve the moment of interia while minimizing the weight added.

The standard convention on teaching archery is to hold the bow depending upon eye dominance. (One exception is in modern <a href="Kyudo">Kyudo</a> where all archers are trained to hold the bow in the left hand.) Therefore, if one is right-eye dominant, they would hold the bow in the left hand and draw the string with the right hand. However, not everyone agrees with this line of thought. A smoother, and more fluid release of the string will produce the most consistently repeatable shots, and therefore may provide greater accuracy of the arrow flight. Some believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity should therefore be the hand that draws and releases the string. Either eye can be used for aiming, and the less dominant eye can be trained over time to become more effective for use. To assist with this, an eye patch can be temporarily worn over the dominant eye.

The hand that holds the bow is referred to as the "bow hand" and its arm the "bow arm". The opposite hand is called the "drawing hand" or "string hand". Terms such as "bow shoulder" or "string elbow" follow the same convention.

If shooting according to eye dominance, right-eye-dominant archers shooting conventionally hold the bow with their left hand. If shooting according to hand dexterity, the archer draws the string with the hand that possesses the greatest dexterity, regardless of eye dominance.

To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the "open stance" or the "closed stance" may be used, although many choose to stick with a "neutral stance". Each archer has a particular preference, but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.

To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground, tipped slightly clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the nock (a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow). This step is called "nocking the arrow". Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the "cock feather", is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest.

A compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest, known as a launcher, and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather/vane pointed either up, or down, depending upon the type of launcher being used.

The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers, or with a mechanical arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique. "Instinctive" shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in the first or second joint, or else on the pads of the fingers. When using a mechanical release aid, the release is hooked onto the D-loop.

Another type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the Mongol warriors, known as the "thumb release", style. This involves using the thumb to draw the string, with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support. To release the string, the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb. When using this type of release, the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i.e. Left hand draw = arrow on left side of bow.

The archer then raises the bow and draws the string, with varying alignments for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions. This is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows, which tend to vary from archer to archer. Compound shooters often experience a slight jerk during the drawback, at around the last inch and a half, where the draw weight is at its maximum—before relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position. The archer draws the string hand towards the face, where it should rest lightly at a fixed "anchor point". This point is consistent from shot to shot, and is usually at the corner of the mouth, on the chin, to the cheek, or to the ear, depending on preferred shooting style. The archer holds the bow arm outwards, toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground, as exemplified by the Korean archer <a href="Jang%20Yong-Ho">Jang Yong-Ho</a>. This keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring.

In modern form, the archer stands erect, forming a "T". The archer's lower <a href="trapezius%20muscle">trapezius muscle</a>s are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some modern recurve bows are equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length. In contrast, traditional English Longbow shooters step "into the bow", exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously, especially when using bows having draw weights from 100 lbs to over 175 lbs. Heavily stacked traditional bows (recurves, long bows, and the like) are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight, whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight around the last inch and a half, dropping holding weight significantly at full draw. Compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy.

The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see <a href="Bow%20draw">Bow draw</a>), or triggering the mechanical release aid. Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also pay attention to the recoil or "follow through" of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.

There are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow.

Mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming. They can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification. They usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string, which aids in a consistent anchor point. Modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity, while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length. Some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent. Barebow archers often use a sight picture, which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed "anchor point" (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same <a href="Predicted%20impact%20point">point</a>. This lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy.

Modern archery equipment usually includes <a href="Sight%20%28device%29">sights</a>. Instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows. The two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under. Split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below. Three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow. This technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called "gun barreling" (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).

When using short bows or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target, but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming then involves hand-eye coordination—which includes proprioception and motor-muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war. Aiming without a sight picture may allow more rapid shooting.

Instinctive shooting is a style of shooting that includes the barebow aiming method that relies heavily upon the subconscious mind, proprioception, and motor/muscle memory to make aiming adjustments; the term used to refer to a general category of archers who did not use a mechanical or fixed sight.

When a projectile is thrown by hand, the speed of the projectile is determined by the <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> imparted by the thrower's muscles performing <a href="Work%20%28physics%29">work</a>. However, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather <a href="Power%20%28physics%29">power</a>, which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available. Power generated by muscles, however, is limited by <a href="Muscle%20contraction%23Force-length%20and%20force-velocity%20relationships">force–velocity relationship</a>, and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force–velocity relationship.

When a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done. This work is stored in the bow as <a href="elastic%20potential%20energy">elastic potential energy</a>, and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance. This same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance. In archery, some energy dissipates through <a href="Hysteresis%23Elastic%20hysteresis">elastic hysteresis</a>, reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the remaining energy, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring. Depending on the arrow's elasticity, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side. This is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers.

Even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism. This makes the arrow oscillate in flight—its center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds. This is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when <a href="dry%20firing">dry firing</a>. Dry firing refers to releasing the bow string without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow. Some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures—and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.
Modern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the <a href="archer%27s%20paradox">archer's paradox</a>. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.

The accurate flight of an arrow is dependent on its fletching. The arrow's manufacturer (a "fletcher") can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis. This improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to "plane" on the air in a random direction after shooting. Even with a carefully made arrow, the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow. Consequently, rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e. accuracy. This rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet. Fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel.

The innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow. The huge ratio of length vs. cross sectional area, coupled with velocity, made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented. Arrows can spread or concentrate force, depending on the application. Practice arrows, for instance, have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration. Arrows designed to pierce armor in the Middle Ages used a very narrow and sharp tip ("bodkinhead") to concentrate the force. Arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip ("broadhead") that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.

Using archery to take game animals is known as "bow hunting". Bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms, as distance between hunter and prey must be much shorter to ensure a humane kill. The skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or tree stand. In many countries, including much of the United States, bow hunting for large and small game is legal. Bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle. Usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting due to their superior power over the recurve bow. These compound bows may feature fiber optic sights and other enhancements. Using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as "<a href="bow%20fishing">bow fishing</a>".

Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called <a href="target%20archery">target archery</a>. A form particularly popular in Europe and <a href="Americas">America</a> is <a href="field%20archery">field archery</a>, shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors.

Para-Archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability governed by the <a href="World%20Archery%20Federation">World Archery Federation</a> (WA), and is one of the sports in the Summer <a href="Paralympic%20Games">Paralympic Games</a>. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as <a href="archery%20games">archery novelty games</a> and <a href="Modern%20competitive%20archery%23Flight%20archery">flight archery</a>, where the aim is to shoot the greatest distance.

Alvar Aalto

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto (; 3 February 1898 – 11 May 1976) was a Finnish architect and designer. His work includes architecture, furniture, <a href="textiles">textiles</a> and <a href="glassware">glassware</a>, as well as sculptures and paintings, though he never regarded himself as an artist, seeing painting and sculpture as "branches of the tree whose trunk is architecture." Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists; among these were the <a href="Ahlstr%C3%B6m-Gullichsen%20family">Ahlström-Gullichsen family</a>. The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from <a href="Nordic%20Classicism">Nordic Classicism</a> of the early work, to a rational <a href="International%20Style%20%28architecture%29">International Style</a> Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a <a href="Gesamtkunstwerk">Gesamtkunstwerk</a>, a "total work of art"; whereby he – together with his first wife <a href="Aino%20Aalto">Aino Aalto</a> – would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware. His furniture designs are considered <a href="Scandinavian%20design">Scandinavian Modern</a>, in the sense of a concern for materials, especially wood, and simplification but also technical experimentation, which led to him receiving patents for various manufacturing processes, such as bent wood. The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city <a href="Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4">Jyväskylä</a>.

Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born in <a href="Kuortane">Kuortane</a>, Finland. His father, Johan Henrik Aalto, was a Finnish-speaking land-surveyor and his mother, Selly (Selma) Matilda (née Hackstedt) was a Swedish-speaking postmistress. When Aalto was 5 years old, the family moved to <a href="Alaj%C3%A4rvi">Alajärvi</a>, and from there to <a href="Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4">Jyväskylä</a> in <a href="Central%20Finland">Central Finland</a>. Aalto studied at the Jyväskylä Lyceum school, where he completed his basic education in 1916 and took drawing lessons from a local artist named <a href="Jonas%20Heiska">Jonas Heiska</a>. In 1916 he then enrolled to study architecture at the <a href="Helsinki%20University%20of%20Technology">Helsinki University of Technology</a>. His studies were interrupted by the <a href="Finnish%20Civil%20War">Finnish Civil War</a>, which he fought in. He fought on the side of the "<a href="White%20Guard%20%28Finland%29">White Army</a>" and fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20L%C3%A4nkipohja">Battle of Länkipohja</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tampere">Battle of Tampere</a>. He built his first piece of architecture while still a student, a house for his parents, at <a href="Alaj%C3%A4rvi">Alajärvi</a>. Afterwards, he continued his education, graduating in 1921. In the summer of 1922 he began his official military service, finishing at the Hamina reserve officer training school, and was promoted to reserve second lieutenant in June 1923.

In 1920, while still a student, Aalto made his first trip abroad, travelling via <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> to <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, where he even briefly found work with the architect Arvid Bjerke. In 1922, he accomplished his first independent piece at the Industrial Exposition in <a href="Tampere">Tampere</a>. In 1923 he returned to <a href="Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4">Jyväskylä</a>, where he opened his first architectural office under the name 'Alvar Aalto, Architect and Monumental Artist'. At that same time he also wrote articles for the Jyväskylä newspaper "Sisä-Suomi" under the pseudonym Remus. During this time, he designed a number of small single-family houses in Jyväskylä, and the office's workload steadily increased. 

On October 6, 1924, Aalto married architect <a href="Aino%20Aalto">Aino Marsio</a>; their honeymoon journey to Italy was Aalto's first trip there, though Aino had previously made a study trip there. The latter trip together sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean</a> region that was to remain important to Aalto for the rest of his life. On their return, they continued with a number of local projects, notably the Jyväskylä Worker's Club, which incorporated a number of motifs which they had studied during their trip, most notably the decorations of the Festival hall modelled on the <a href="Rucellai%20Sepulchre">Rucellai Sepulchre</a> in Florence by <a href="Leon%20Battista%20Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a>. Following winning the architecture competition for the Southwest Finland Agricultural Cooperative building in 1927 the Aaltos moved their office to <a href="Turku">Turku</a>. They had made contact with the city's most progressive architect, <a href="Erik%20Bryggman">Erik Bryggman</a>, already before moving, and they then began collaborating with him, most notably on the Turku Fair of 1928-29. Aalto's biographer, Göran Schildt, claimed that Bryggman was the only architect with whom Aalto cooperated as an equal. With increasing works in the Finnish capital, the Aaltos' office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki.

The Aaltos designed and built a <a href="Villa%20Aalto">joint house-office</a> (1935–36) for themselves in <a href="Munkkiniemi">Munkkiniemi</a>, Helsinki, but later (1954–56) had a <a href="Studio%20Aalto">purpose-built office</a> erected in the same neighbourhood – nowadays the former is a "home museum" and the latter the premises of the Alvar Aalto Academy. In 1926 the young Aaltos designed and had built for themselves a summer cottage in <a href="Alaj%C3%A4rvi">Alajärvi</a>, Villa Flora. Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949. Aino and Alvar Aalto had 2 children, a daughter Johanna "Hanni" Alanen, born Aalto, 1925, and a son Hamilkar Aalto, 1928. In 1952 Aalto married architect <a href="Elissa%20M%C3%A4kiniemi">Elissa Mäkiniemi</a> (died 1994), who had been working as an assistant in his office. In 1952 Aalto designed and had built a summer cottage, the <a href="Alvar%20Aalto%20Museum%23The%20Muuratsalo%20Experiental%20House">so-called Experimental House</a>, for himself and his new wife in <a href="Muuratsalo">Muuratsalo</a> in Central Finland. Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976, in <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, and is buried in the <a href="Hietaniemi%20cemetery">Hietaniemi cemetery</a> in Helsinki. His wife and the office employees continued the works of the office which were still in progress. In 1978 the <a href="Museum%20of%20Finnish%20Architecture">Museum of Finnish Architecture</a> in Helsinki arranged a major exhibition of Aalto's works.

Although he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic <a href="modernism">modernism</a>, a closer examination of the historical facts reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular <a href="Gunnar%20Asplund">Gunnar Asplund</a> and <a href="Sven%20Markelius">Sven Markelius</a>. What they and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries had in common was that they started off from a classical education and were first designing classical architecture, though what historians now call <a href="Nordic%20Classicism">Nordic Classicism</a> – a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of <a href="National%20romantic%20style">National Romanticism</a> – before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism. On returning to Jyväskylä in 1923 to establish his own architect's office, Aalto busied himself with a number of single-family homes, all designed in the Nordic Classicism style, such as the manor-like house for his mother's cousin Terho Manner in Töysa in 1923, a summer villa for the Jyväskylä chief constable in 1923 and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala in 1924. During this period he also completed his first public buildings, the Jyväskylä Workers' Club in 1925, the Jyväskylä Defence Corps building in 1926 and the Seinäjoki Defence Corp building in 1924–29. Aalto also entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, both in Finland and abroad, including the two competitions for the Finnish Parliament building in 1923 and 1924, the extension to the <a href="University%20of%20Helsinki">University of Helsinki</a> in 1931, and the building to house the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1926–27. Furthermore, this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. Among his most well-known essays from this period are "Urban culture" (1924), "Temple baths on Jyväskylä ridge" (1925), "Abbé Coignard's sermon" (1925), and "From doorstep to living room" (1926).

The shift in Aalto's design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the <a href="Vyborg%20Library">Viipuri Library</a> in <a href="Vyborg">Vyborg</a> (1927–35), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal to the completed high-modernist building. Yet his humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library: the interior displays natural materials, warm colours, and undulating lines. Due to problems over financing and a change of site, the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years, and during that same time he also designed the Standard Apartment Building (1928-29) in Turku, Turun Sanomat Building (1929–30) and Paimio Sanatorium (1929–32). A number of factors heralded Aalto's shift towards modernism: on a personal level, Aalto's increased familiarization of international trends especially after travelling throughout Europe, but in terms of completed projects it was the client of the Standard Apartment Building giving Aalto the opportunity to experiment with concrete prefabrication, the cutting-edge Corbusian form language of the Turun Sanomat Building, and these were then carried forward both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the ongoing design for the library. Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works, they too carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring, synthetic attitude. It has been pointed out that the planning principle for Paimio Sanatorium - the splayed wings - was indebted to the Zonnestraal Sanatorium (1925-31) by Jan Duiker, which Aalto visited while it was still under construction. But while these early Functionalist works by Aalto bear hallmarks of influences from <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>, <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a> and other key modernist figures of central Europe, in all these buildings Aalto nevertheless started to show his individuality in a departure from such norms with the introduction of organic references.

Through Sven Markelius, Aalto became a member of the <a href="Congres%20Internationaux%20d%27Architecture%20Moderne">Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne</a> (CIAM), attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933, where he established a close friendship with <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Moholy-Nagy">László Moholy-Nagy</a>, <a href="Sigfried%20Giedion">Sigfried Giedion</a> and <a href="Philip%20Morton%20Shand">Philip Morton Shand</a>. It was during this time that he followed closely the work of the main driving force behind the new modernism, <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>, and visited him in his Paris office several times in the following years.

It was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium (1932) and Viipuri Library (1935) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture. His reputation grew in the USA following the invitation to hold a retrospective exhibition of his works at the MOMA in New York in 1938, which was also the first time he visited the US. The significance of the exhibition - which afterwards went on a 12-city tour of the country - lies in the fact that he was only the second ever architect - after Le Corbusier - to have a solo exhibition at the museum. His reputation grew in the USA following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the <a href="1939%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1939 New York World's Fair</a>, described by <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> as a "work of genius". It could be said that Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, "Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition" (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that "Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes".

During the 1930s Alvar spent some time experimenting with laminated wood, making sculptures, and abstract reliefs, characterized by irregular curved forms. Utilizing this knowledge he was able to solve technical problems concerning the flexibility of wood and also of working out spatial issues in his designs. Aalto's early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design <a href="Villa%20Mairea">Villa Mairea</a> (1939) in <a href="Noormarkku">Noormarkku</a>, the luxury home of the young industrialist couple Harry and <a href="Maire%20Gullichsen">Maire Gullichsen</a>. It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client, and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design, inspiring them to be more daring in their work. The original design was to include a <a href="art%20museum">private art gallery</a>, but this was never built. The building forms a U-shape around a central inner "garden" the central feature of which is a kidney-shaped swimming pool. Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style, alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents. The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences, from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism, as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture. While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family, Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing.

His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in the USA. Because of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, he returned to Finland to direct the Reconstruction Office. After the war, he returned to MIT, where he designed the student dormitory <a href="List%20of%20MIT%20undergraduate%20dormitories%23Baker%20House">Baker House</a>, completed in 1949. The dormitory lay along the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles River</a> and its undulating form provided maximum view and ventilation for each resident. This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period. Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new <a href="Helsinki%20University%20of%20Technology">Helsinki University of Technology</a> campus (starting in 1950), <a href="S%C3%A4yn%C3%A4tsalo%20Town%20Hall">Säynätsalo Town Hall</a> (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), <a href="Kulttuuritalo">Helsinki House of Culture</a> (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the so-called Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).

In the fifties Aalto immersed himself in his sculpting, be it with wood, bronze, marble, or mixed media. Among the notable works from this period is the memorial to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Suomussalmi">Battle of Suomussalmi</a> (1960); located on the battlefield, it consists of a leaning bronze pillar on a pedestal.

The early 1960s and 1970s (up until his death in 1976) were marked by key works in Helsinki, in particular the huge town plan for the void in centre of Helsinki adjacent to <a href="T%C3%B6%C3%B6l%C3%B6">Töölö</a> Bay and the vast <a href="VR%20warehouses">railway yards</a>, and marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station, both by <a href="Eliel%20Saarinen">Eliel Saarinen</a>. In his town plan Aalto proposed a line of separate marble-clad buildings fronting the bay which would house various cultural institutions, including a concert hall, opera, museum of architecture and headquarters for the <a href="Finnish%20Academy">Finnish Academy</a>. The scheme also extended into the <a href="Kamppi">Kamppi</a> district with a series of tall office blocks. Aalto first presented his scheme in 1961, but it went through various modifications during the early 1960s. Only two fragments of the overall plan were ever realized: the <a href="Finlandia%20Hall">Finlandia Hall</a> concert hall (1976) fronting Töölö Bay, and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company (1975). The <a href="Ludwig%20Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Miesian</a> formal language of geometric grids employed in the buildings was also used by Aalto for other sites in Helsinki, including the <a href="Stora%20Enso">Enso-Gutzeit</a> building (1962), the <a href="Stockmann">Academic Bookstore</a> (1962) and the SYP Bank building (1969).

Following Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow, Elissa, completing works already to some extent designed. These works include the Jyväskylä City Theatre and <a href="Aalto%20Theatre">Essen opera house</a>. Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material.

Whereas Aalto was famous for his architecture, his furniture designs were well thought of and are still popular today. He studied <a href="Josef%20Hoffmann">Josef Hoffmann</a> and the <a href="Wiener%20Werkst%C3%A4tte">Wiener Werkstätte</a>, and for a period of time, worked under <a href="Eliel%20Saarinen">Eliel Saarinen</a>. He also gained inspiration from <a href="Gebr%C3%BCder%20Thonet">Gebrüder Thonet</a>. During the late 1920s and 1930s he, working closely with Aino Aalto, also focused a lot of his energy on furniture design, partly due to the decision to design much of the individual furniture pieces and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium. Of particular significance was the experimentation in bent plywood chairs, most notably the so-called Paimio chair, which had been designed for the sitting tuberculosis patient. The Aaltos, together with visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the <a href="Artek%20%28company%29">Artek</a> company in 1935, ostensibly to sell Aalto products but also other imported products. He became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair design using wood.

Aalto's awards included the <a href="Prince%20Eugen%20Medal">Prince Eugen Medal</a> in 1954, the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> in 1957 and the <a href="AIA%20Gold%20Medal">Gold Medal</a> from the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">American Institute of Architects</a> in 1963. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1957. He also was a member of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Finland">Academy of Finland</a>, and was its president from 1963 to 1968. From 1925 to 1956 he was a member of the <a href="Congr%C3%A8s%20International%20d%27Architecture%20Moderne">Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne</a>. In 1960 he received an honorary doctorate at the <a href="Norwegian%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a> (NTNU).

Aalto's career spans the changes in style from (<a href="Nordic%20Classicism">Nordic Classicism</a>) to purist <a href="International%20style%20%28architecture%29">International Style</a> Modernism to a more personal, synthetic and idiosyncratic Modernism. Aalto's wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of <a href="city%20planning">city planning</a> and architecture to interior design, furniture and <a href="glassware">glassware</a> design and painting. It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings, approximately 300 of which were built, the vast majority of which are in Finland. He also has a few buildings in France, Germany, Italy and the USA.

Aalto's work with wood, was influenced by early Scandinavian architects; however, his experiments and departure from the norm brought attention to his ability to make wood do things not previously done. His techniques in the way he cut the <a href="beech">beech</a> tree, for example, and also his ability to use plywood as structural and aesthetic. Other examples include the rough-hewn vertical placement of logs at his pavilion at the <a href="Lapua">Lapua</a> expo, looking similar to a medieval barricade, at the orchestra platform at <a href="turku">turku</a> and the Paris expo at the World Fair, he used varying sizes and shapes of planks. Also at Paris and at <a href="Villa%20Mairea">Villa Mairea</a> he utilized birch boarding in a vertical arrangement. Also his famous undulating walls and ceilings made of red pine. In his roofing, he created massive spans (155-foot at the covered statium at <a href="Otaniemi">Otaniemi</a>) all without tie rods. His stairway at Villa Mairea, he evokes feelings of a natural forest by binding beech wood with withes into columns.

Aalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design, and many of his small-scale "sculptural" experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms. These experiments also led to a number of patents: for example, he invented a new form of laminated bent-plywood furniture in 1932 (which was patented in 1933). His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> design school, especially <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Moholy-Nagy">László Moholy-Nagy</a>, whom he first met in 1930. Aalto's furniture was exhibited in London in 1935, to great critical acclaim, and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto, together with his wife Aino, <a href="Maire%20Gullichsen">Maire Gullichsen</a> and Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the company <a href="Artek%20%28company%29">Artek</a> that same year. Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by <a href="Iittala">Iittala</a>.

Aalto's 'High Stool' and 'Stool E60' (manufactured by <a href="Artek%20%28company%29">Artek</a>) are currently used in <a href="Apple%20Store">Apple Store</a>s across the world to serve as seating for customers. Finished in black lacquer, the stools are used to seat customers at the 'Genius Bar' and also in other areas of the store at times when seating is required for a product workshop or special event. Aalto was also influential in bringing <a href="modern%20art">modern art</a> to the knowledge of the Finnish people, in particular the work of his friends, <a href="Alexander%20Milne%20Calder">Alexander Milne Calder</a> and <a href="Fernand%20L%C3%A9ger">Fernand Léger</a>.




As already mentioned, Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, "Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition" (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that "Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes". However, a few more recent architecture critics and historians have questioned Aalto's position of influence in the canonic history. Italian Marxist architecture historians <a href="Manfredo%20Tafuri">Manfredo Tafuri</a> and <a href="Francesco%20Dal%20Co">Francesco Dal Co</a> put forward the viewpoint that Aalto's "historical significance has perhaps been rather exaggerated; with Aalto we are outside of the great themes that have made the course of contemporary architecture so dramatic. The qualities of his works have a meaning only as masterful distractions, not subject to reproduction outside the remote reality in which they have their roots." Their viewpoint was propounded by their own priority given to urbanism, seeing Aalto as an anti-urban, and thus consequently disparaging what they regarded as peripheral non-urban areas of the world: "Essentially his architecture is not appropriate to urban typologies." Similarly concerned with the appropriateness of Aalto's form language, at the other end of the political spectrum, American postmodernist critic <a href="Charles%20Jencks">Charles Jencks</a> made a claim for the need for buildings to signify meaning; however, he then lifted out Aalto's Pensions Institute building as an example of what he termed Aalto's 'soft paternalism': "Conceived as a fragmented mass to break up the feeling of bureaucracy, it succeeds all too well in being humane and killing the pensioner with kindness. The forms are familiar red brick and ribbon-strip windows broken by copper and bronze elements – all carried through with a literal-mindedness that borders on the soporific." But also during Aalto's lifetime he faced critique from his fellow architects in Finland, most notably Kirmo Mikkola and <a href="Juhani%20Pallasmaa">Juhani Pallasmaa</a>; by the last decade of his life Aalto's work was seen as idiosyncratic and individualistic, when the opposing tendencies of rationalism and constructivism – often championed under left-wing politics – argued for anonymous virtually non-aesthetic architecture. Mikkola wrote of Aalto's late works: "Aalto has moved to his present baroque line..."

Aalto has been commemorated in a number of ways:



Göran Schildt has written and edited many books on Aalto, the most well-known being the three-volume biography, usually referred to as the definitive biography on Aalto.

Comparison of American and British English

The <a href="English%20language">English language</a> was first introduced to the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> by <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">British colonization</a>, beginning in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Similarly, the language spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British trade and colonization elsewhere and the spread of the former <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, which, by 1921, held sway over a population of 470–570 million people, approximately a quarter of the world's population at that time.

Over the past 400 years, the form of the language used in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>—especially in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>—and that used in the United Kingdom have diverged in a few minor ways, leading to the versions now occasionally referred to as American English and British English. Differences between the two include <a href="pronunciation">pronunciation</a>, <a href="grammar">grammar</a>, <a href="Lexis%20%28linguistics%29">vocabulary (lexis)</a>, <a href="spelling">spelling</a>, <a href="punctuation">punctuation</a>, <a href="idiom">idiom</a>s, and formatting of <a href="calendar%20date">date</a>s and <a href="number">number</a>s. Although, the differences in written and most spoken grammar structure tend to be much less than those of other aspects of the language in terms of mutual intelligibility. A small number of words have completely different meanings in the two versions or are even unknown or not used in one of the versions. One particular contribution towards formalizing these differences came from <a href="Noah%20Webster">Noah Webster</a>, who wrote the <a href="Webster%27s%20Dictionary">first American dictionary</a> (published 1828) with the intention of showing that people in the United States spoke a different dialect from Britain, much like a regional accent.

This divergence between American English and British English has provided opportunities for humorous comment, e.g., <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> has a character say that the United States and United Kingdom are "two countries divided by a common language"; and <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> that "We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, the language" ("<a href="The%20Canterville%20Ghost">The Canterville Ghost</a>", 1888). <a href="Henry%20Sweet">Henry Sweet</a> incorrectly predicted in 1877 that within a century American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible ("A Handbook of Phonetics"). It may be the case that increased worldwide communication through radio, television, the Internet and <a href="globalization">globalization</a> has reduced the tendency towards regional variation. This can result either in some variations becoming extinct (for instance, "the wireless", being progressively superseded by "the radio") or in the acceptance of wide variations as "perfectly good English" everywhere.

Although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are occasional differences which might cause embarrassment—for example, in American English a "rubber" is usually interpreted as a "condom" rather than an "eraser"; and a British "fanny" refers to the female pubic area, while the American "fanny" refers to an "ass" (US) or an "arse" (UK).


"Note: A lexicon is not made up of different words but different "units of meaning" (lexical units or lexical items e.g., "fly ball" in baseball), including idioms and figures of speech. This makes it easier to compare the dialects."

Though the influence of cross-culture media has done much to familiarize BrE and AmE speakers with each other's regional words and terms, many words are still recognized as part of a single form of English. Though the use of a British word would be acceptable in AmE (and vice versa), most listeners would recognize the word as coming from the other form of English and treat it much the same as a word borrowed from any other language.

Most speakers of AmE are aware of some BrE terms, although they may not generally use them or may be confused as to whether someone intends the American or British meaning (such as for "<a href="biscuit">biscuit</a>"). It is generally very easy to guess what some words, such as "driving licence", mean. However, use of many other British words such as "<a href="Polari%23Naff">naff</a>" (slang but commonly used to mean "not very good") are unheard of in American English.

Speakers of BrE are likely to understand most common AmE terms, examples such as "sidewalk" (pavement), "gas (gasoline/petrol)", "counterclockwise" (anticlockwise) or "elevator (lift)", without any problem, thanks in part to considerable exposure to American popular culture and literature. Certain terms that are heard less frequently, especially those likely to be absent or rare in American popular culture, e.g., "copacetic (satisfactory)", are unlikely to be understood by most BrE speakers.

Words such as "bill" and "biscuit" are used regularly in both AmE and BrE but mean different things in each form. In AmE a bill is usually paper money (as in "dollar bill") though it can mean the same as in BrE, an invoice (as in "the repair bill was £250"). In AmE a biscuit (from the French twice baked as in biscotto) is what in BrE is called a scone and a biscuit in BrE is in AmE a cookie (from the Dutch 'little cake'). As chronicled by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, the opposite meanings of the verb "<a href="Table%20%28verb%29">to table</a>" created a misunderstanding during a meeting of the Allied forces; in BrE to table an item on an agenda means to "open it up" for discussion whereas in AmE, it means to "remove" it from discussion, or at times, to suspend or delay discussion.

The word "football" in BrE refers to <a href="Association%20football">Association football</a>, also known as <a href="Names%20for%20association%20football">soccer</a>. In AmE, "football" means <a href="American%20football">American football</a>. The standard AmE term "soccer", a contraction of "association (football)", is of British origin, derived from the formalization of different codes of football in the 19th century, and was a fairly unremarkable usage (possibly marked for class) in BrE until relatively recently; it has lately become perceived incorrectly as an Americanism. In international (i.e. non-American) context, particularly in sports news outside English-speaking North America, American (or US branches of foreign) news agencies also use "football" to mean "soccer", especially in direct quotes.

Similarly, the word "hockey" in BrE refers to <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a> and in AmE, "hockey" means <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a>.

Words with <a href="List%20of%20words%20having%20different%20meanings%20in%20British%20and%20American%20English">completely different meanings</a> are relatively few; most of the time there are either (1) words with one or more shared meanings and one or more meanings unique to one variety (for example, bathroom and toilet) or (2) words the meanings of which are actually common to both BrE and AmE but that show differences in frequency, connotation or denotation (for example, "smart", "clever", "mad").

Some differences in usage and/or meaning can cause confusion or embarrassment. For example the word "fanny" is a slang word for <a href="vulva">vulva</a> in BrE but means <a href="buttocks">buttocks</a> in AmE—the AmE phrase "<a href="fanny%20pack">fanny pack</a>" is "bum bag" in BrE. In AmE the word "pissed" means being annoyed whereas in BrE it is a coarse word for being drunk (in both varieties, "pissed off" means irritated).

Similarly, in AmE the word "pants" is the common word for the BrE "trousers" and "knickers" refers to a variety of half-length trousers (though most AmE users would use the term "shorts" rather than knickers), while the majority of BrE speakers would understand "pants" to mean "underpants" and "knickers" to mean "female underpants".

Sometimes the confusion is more subtle. In AmE the word "quite" used as a qualifier is generally a reinforcement: for example, "I'm quite hungry" means "I'm very hungry". In BrE "quite" (which is much more common in conversation) may have this meaning, as in "quite right" or "quite mad", but it more commonly means "somewhat", so that in BrE "I'm quite hungry" can mean "I'm somewhat hungry". This divergence of use can lead to misunderstanding.


It is increasingly common for Americans to say "Happy holidays", referring to all, or at least multiple, winter holidays (Christmas, <a href="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a>, <a href="Winter%20solstice">Winter solstice</a>, <a href="Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a>, etc.) especially when the subject's religious observances are not known; the phrase is rarely heard in the UK. In Britain, the phrases "holiday season" and "holiday period" refer to the period in the summer when most people take time off from work, and travel; AmE does not use "holiday" in this sense, instead using "<a href="vacation">vacation</a>" for recreational excursions.

Both BrE and AmE use the expression "I couldn't care less" to mean the speaker does not care at all. Some Americans use "I could care less" to mean the same thing. This variant is frequently derided as sloppy, as the literal meaning of the words is that the speaker "does" care to some extent.

In both areas, saying, "I don't mind" often means, "I'm not annoyed" (for example, by someone's smoking), while "I don't care" often means, "The matter is trivial or boring". However, in answering a question such as "Tea or coffee?", if either alternative is equally acceptable an American may answer, "I don't care", while a British person may answer, "I don't mind". Either sounds odd to the other.

A number of English idioms that have essentially the same meaning show lexical differences between the British and the American version; for instance:

Generally, a non-restrictive relative clause (also called non-defining or supplementary) is one that contains information that is supplementary, i.e. does not change the meaning of the rest of the sentence, while a restrictive relative clause (also called defining or integrated) is, one which contains information essential to the meaning of the sentence, effectively limiting the modified noun phrase to a subset that is defined by the relative clause.
An example of a restrictive clause is "The dog that bit the man was brown."
An example of a non-restrictive clause is "The dog, which bit the man, was brown."
In the former "that bit the man" identifies which dog the statement is about.
In the latter, "which bit the man" provides supplementary information about a known dog.
A non-restrictive relative clause is typically set off by commas, whereas a restrictive relative clause is not, but this is not a rule that is universally observed. In speech, this is also reflected in the intonation.
Writers commonly use "which" to introduce a non-restrictive clause, and "that" to introduce a restrictive clause. "That" is rarely used to introduce a non-restrictive relative clause in prose. "Which" and "that" are both commonly used to introduce a restrictive clause; a study in 1977 reported that about 75 percent of occurrences of "which" were in restrictive clauses. 

H. W. Fowler, in "A Dictionary of Modern English Usage" of 1926 followed others in suggesting that it would be preferable to use "which" as the non-restrictive (what he calls non-defining) pronoun and "that" as the restrictive (what he calls defining) pronoun, but he also stated that this rule was observed neither by most writers nor by the best writers. 
He implied that his suggested usage was more common in American English.
Fowler notes that his recommended usage presents problems, in particular that "that" must be the first word of the clause, which means, for instance, that "which" cannot be replaced by "that" when it immediately follows a preposition (e.g. "the basic unit "from which" matter is constructed") – though this would not prevent a stranded preposition (e.g. "the basic unit "that" matter is constructed "from"").

Style guides by American prescriptivists, such as Bryan Garner, typically insist, for stylistic reasons, that "that" be used for restrictive relative clauses and "which" be used for non-restrictive clauses, referring to the use of "which" in restrictive clauses as a "mistake". 
According to the 2015 edition of "<a href="Fowler%27s%20Dictionary%20of%20Modern%20English%20Usage">Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage</a>", "In AmE "which" is "not generally used in restrictive clauses, and that fact is then interpreted as the absolute rule that only "that" may introduce a restrictive clause", whereas in BrE "either "that" or "which" may be used in restrictive clauses", but many British people "believe that "that" is obligatory".

Before the early 18th century <a href="English%20spelling">English spelling</a> was not standardized. Different standards became noticeable after the publishing of influential <a href="dictionary">dictionaries</a>. For the most part current BrE spellings follow those of <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>'s "<a href="A%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20English%20Language">Dictionary of the English Language</a>" (1755), while AmE spellings follow those of <a href="Noah%20Webster">Noah Webster</a>'s "<a href="An%20American%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20English%20Language">An American Dictionary of the English Language</a>" (1828). In Britain, the influences of those who preferred the French spellings of certain words proved decisive. In many cases AmE spelling deviated from mainstream British spelling; on the other hand it has also often retained older forms. Many of the now characteristic AmE spellings were popularized, although often not created, by Noah Webster. Webster chose already-existing alternative spellings "on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology". Webster did attempt to introduce some <a href="English-language%20spelling%20reform">reformed spellings</a>, as did the <a href="Simplified%20Spelling%20Board">Simplified Spelling Board</a> in the early 20th century, but most were not adopted. Later spelling changes in the UK had little effect on present-day US spelling, and vice versa.

There have been some trends of transatlantic difference in use of periods in some abbreviations. These are discussed at "<a href="Abbreviation%23Periods%20%28full%20stops%29%20and%20spaces">Abbreviation § Periods (full stops) and spaces</a>". Unit symbols such as kg and Hz are never punctuated.

In British English, "( )" marks are often referred to as brackets, whereas "[ ]" are called square brackets and "{ }" are called curly brackets. In formal British English and in American English "( )" marks are parentheses (singular: parenthesis), "[ ]" are called brackets or square brackets, and "{ }" can be called either curly brackets or curly braces. In both countries, standard usage is to place punctuation outside the parenthesis, unless the entire sentence is contained within them:
In the case of a parenthetical expression which is itself a complete sentence, the final punctuation may be placed inside the parenthesis, particularly if not a period:

Atomic semantics

Atomic semantics is a term which describes a type of guarantee provided by a <a href="data%20register">data register</a> shared by several <a href="central%20processing%20unit">processors</a> in a <a href="parallel%20machine">parallel machine</a> or in a network of computers working together.
Atomic semantics are very strong. An atomic register provides strong guarantees even when there is concurrency and failures.

A read/write register R stores a value and is accessed by two basic operations: read and write(v). A read returns the value stored in R and write(v) changes the value stored in R to v.
A register is called atomic if it satisfies the two following properties:

1) Each invocation op of a read or write operation:

•Must appear as if it were executed at a single point τ(op) in time.

•τ (op) works as follow:
τb(op) ≤ τ (op) ≤ τe(op): where τb(op) and τe(op) indicate the time when the operation op begins and ends.

•If op1 ≠ op2, then τ (op1)≠τ (op2)

2) Each read operation returns the value written by the last write operation before the read, in the sequence where all operations are ordered by their τ values.

Atomic/Linearizable register:

Termination: when a node is correct,sooner or later each read and write operation will complete.

Safety Property (Linearization points for read and write and failed operations):

Read operation:It appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.

Write operation: Similar to read operation,it appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.

Failed operation(The atomic term comes from this notion):It appears as if it is completed at every single node or it never happened at any node.

Example : We know that an atomic register is one that is linearizable to a sequential safe register.

The following picture shows where we should put the linearization point for each operation:

An atomic register could be defined for a variable with a single writer but multi- readers(SWMR),single-writer/single-reader (SWSR),or multi-writer/multi-reader(MWMR). Here is an example of a multi-reader multi-writer atomic register which is accessed by three processes (P1,P2,P3).Note that R.read() → v means that the corresponding read operation returns v, which is the value of the register. Therefore, the following execution of the register R could satisfies the definition of the atomic registers:
R.write(1), R.read()→1, R.write(3), R.write(2), R.read()→2, R.read()→2.

<doc id="2015" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015" title="Antarctic Circumpolar Current">
Antarctic Circumpolar Current

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is an <a href="ocean%20current">ocean current</a> that flows clockwise from west to east around <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. An alternative name for the ACC is the West Wind Drift. The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> and has a mean transport of 100-150 <a href="Sverdrup">Sverdrup</a>s (Sv, million m³/s), making it the largest ocean current. More recent research even puts this number at over 173 Sv. The current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica, enabling that continent to maintain its huge <a href="ice%20sheet">ice sheet</a>.

Associated with the Circumpolar Current is the <a href="Antarctic%20Convergence">Antarctic Convergence</a>, where the cold Antarctic waters meet the warmer waters of the <a href="subantarctic">subantarctic</a>, creating a zone of upwelling nutrients. These nurture high levels of <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> with associated copepods and krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses, and a wealth of other species.

The ACC has been known to sailors for centuries; it greatly speeds up any travel from west to east, but makes sailing extremely difficult from east to west; although this is mostly due to the prevailing <a href="Westerlies">westerly winds</a>. The circumstances preceding the <a href="mutiny%20on%20the%20Bounty">mutiny on the "Bounty"</a> and <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a>'s story "Make Westing" poignantly illustrated the difficulty it caused for mariners seeking to round <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> on the clipper ship route between New York and California. The <a href="clipper%20route">clipper route</a>, which is the fastest sailing route around the world, follows the ACC around three continental capes – <a href="Cape%20Agulhas">Cape Agulhas</a> (Africa), <a href="South%20East%20Cape">South East Cape</a> (Australia), and <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> (South America).

The current creates the <a href="Ross%20Gyre">Ross</a> and <a href="Weddell%20Gyre">Weddell gyres</a>.

The ACC connects the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>, <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, and <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>s, and serves as a principal pathway of exchange among them. The current is strongly constrained by <a href="landform">landform</a> and <a href="bathymetric">bathymetric</a> features. To trace it starting arbitrarily at South America, it flows through the <a href="Drake%20Passage">Drake Passage</a> between South America and the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a> and then is split by the <a href="Scotia%20Arc">Scotia Arc</a> to the east, with a shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the <a href="Falkland%20Current">Falkland Current</a> and a deeper branch passing through the Arc more to the east before also turning to the north. Passing through the Indian Ocean, the current first retroflects the <a href="Agulhas%20Current">Agulhas Current</a> to form the <a href="Agulhas%20Return%20Current">Agulhas Return Current</a> before it is split by the <a href="Kerguelen%20Plateau">Kerguelen Plateau</a>, and then moving northward again. Deflection is also seen as it passes over the <a href="mid-ocean%20ridge">mid-ocean ridge</a> in the Southeast Pacific.

The current is accompanied by three <a href="Front%20%28Oceanography%29">fronts</a>: the Subantarctic front (SAF), the <a href="Polar%20front">Polar front</a> (PF), and the Southern ACC front (SACC). Furthermore, the waters of the Southern Ocean are separated from the warmer and saltier subtropical waters by the <a href="subtropical%20front">subtropical front</a> (STF).

The northern boundary of the ACC is defined by the northern edge of the SAF, this being the most northerly water to pass through Drake Passage and therefore be circumpolar. Much of the ACC transport is carried in this front, which is defined as the latitude at which a subsurface salinity minimum or a thick layer of unstratified Subantarctic <a href="mode%20water">mode water</a> first appears, allowed by temperature dominating density stratification. Still further south lies the PF, which is marked by a transition to very cold, relatively fresh, Antarctic Surface Water at the surface. Here a temperature minimum is allowed by salinity dominating density stratification, due to the lower temperatures. Farther south still is the SACC, which is determined as the southernmost extent of Circumpolar Deep Water (temperature of about 2 °C at 400 m). This water mass flows along the shelfbreak of the western Antarctic Peninsula and thus marks the most southerly water flowing through Drake Passage and therefore circumpolar. The bulk of the transport is carried in the middle two fronts.

The total transport of the ACC at Drake Passage is estimated to be around 135 Sv, or about 135 times the transport of all the world's rivers combined. There is a relatively small addition of flow in the Indian Ocean, with the transport south of <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> reaching around 147 Sv, at which point the current is probably the largest on the planet.

The circumpolar current is driven by the strong westerly winds in the latitudes of the Southern Ocean.

In latitudes where there are continents, winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents. But in the Southern Ocean, the momentum imparted to the surface waters cannot be offset in this way. There are different theories on how the Circumpolar Current balances the momentum imparted by the winds. The increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outward from the axis of the Earth's rotation (in other words, northward) as a result of the <a href="Coriolis%20force">Coriolis force</a>. This northward <a href="Ekman%20transport">Ekman transport</a> is balanced by a southward, pressure-driven flow below the depths of the major ridge systems. Some theories connect these flows directly, implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the Southern Ocean, transformation of these waters into light surface waters, and a transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north. Such theories link the magnitude of the Circumpolar Current with the global <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">thermohaline circulation</a>, particularly the properties of the North Atlantic.

Alternatively, <a href="Eddy%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29%23Mesoscale%20ocean%20eddies">ocean eddies</a>, the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms, or the large-scale meanders of the Circumpolar Current may directly transport momentum downward in the water column. This is because such flows can produce a net southward flow in the troughs and a net northward flow over the ridges without requiring any transformation of density. In practice both the thermohaline and the eddy/meander mechanisms are likely to be important.

The current flows at a rate of about over the <a href="Macquarie%20Fault%20Zone">Macquarie Ridge</a> south of New Zealand. The ACC varies with time. Evidence of this is the <a href="Antarctic%20Circumpolar%20Wave">Antarctic Circumpolar Wave</a>, a periodic oscillation that affects the climate of much of the southern hemisphere. There is also the <a href="Antarctic%20oscillation">Antarctic oscillation</a>, which involves changes in the location and strength of Antarctic winds. Trends in the Antarctic Oscillation have been hypothesized to account for an increase in the transport of the Circumpolar Current over the past two decades.

Published estimates of the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current vary, but it is commonly considered to have started at the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>/<a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> boundary. The isolation of Antarctica and formation of the ACC occurred with the openings of the <a href="Tasmanian%20Seaway">Tasmanian Seaway</a> and the <a href="Drake%20Passage">Drake Passage</a>. The Tasmanian Seaway separates East Antarctica and Australia, and is reported to have opened to water circulation 33.5 Ma. The timing of the opening of the Drake Passage, between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula, is more disputed; <a href="tectonic">tectonic</a> and sediment evidence show that it could have been open as early as pre 34 Ma, estimates of the opening of the Drake passage are between 20 and 40 Ma. The isolation of Antarctica by the current is credited by many researchers with causing the <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a> of Antarctica and global cooling in the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> epoch. Oceanic models have shown that the opening of these two passages limited polar heat convergence and caused a cooling of sea surface temperatures by several degrees; other models have shown that CO levels also played a significant role in the glaciation of Antarctica.

Antarctic sea ice cycles seasonally, in February–March the amount of sea ice is lowest, and in August–September the sea ice is at its greatest extent. Ice levels have been monitored by satellite since 1973. Upwelling of deep water under the sea ice brings substantial amounts of nutrients. As the ice melts, the melt water provides stability and the critical depth is well below the mixing depth, which allows for a positive net <a href="primary%20production">primary production</a>. As the sea ice recedes epontic algae dominate the first phase of the bloom, and a strong bloom dominate by diatoms follows the ice melt south.

Another phytoplankton bloom occurs more to the north near the <a href="antarctic%20convergence">antarctic convergence</a>, here nutrients are present from <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">thermohaline circulation</a>. Phytoplankton blooms are dominated by diatoms and grazed by copepods in the open ocean, and by krill closer to the continent. Diatom production continues through the summer, and populations of krill are sustained, bringing large numbers of <a href="cetacean">cetacean</a>s, <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, seals, birds, and fish to the area.

Phytoplankton blooms are believed to be limited by irradiance in the austral (southern hemisphere) spring, and by biologically available iron in the summer. Much of the biology in the area occurs along the major fronts of the current, the Subtropical, Subantarctic, and the Antarctic Polar fronts, these are areas associated with well defined temperature changes. Size and distribution of phytoplankton are also related to fronts. Microphytoplankton (>20μm) are found at fronts and at sea ice boundaries, while <a href="nanophytoplankton">nanophytoplankton</a> (<20μm) are found between fronts.

Studies of phytoplankton stocks in the southern sea have shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is dominated by diatoms, while the <a href="Weddell%20Sea">Weddell Sea</a> has abundant <a href="coccolithophorid">coccolithophorid</a>s and silicoflagellates. Surveys of the SW Indian Ocean have shown phytoplankton group variation based on their location relative to the Polar Front, with <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s dominating South of the front, and dinoflagellates and <a href="flagellates">flagellates</a> in higher populations North of the front.

Some research has been conducted on Antarctic phytoplankton as a <a href="carbon%20sink">carbon sink</a>. Areas of open water left from ice melt are good areas for phytoplankton blooms. The phytoplankton takes carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. As the blooms die and sink, the carbon can be stored in sediments for thousands of years. This natural carbon sink is estimated to remove 3.5 million tonnes from the ocean each year. 3.5 million tonnes of carbon taken from the ocean and atmosphere is equivalent to 12.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.

An expedition in May 2008 by 19 scientists studied the geology and biology of eight <a href="Macquarie%20Fault%20Zone">Macquarie Ridge</a> sea mounts, as well as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to investigate the effects of climate change of the Southern Ocean. The circumpolar current merges the waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and carries up to 150 times the volume of water flowing in all of the world's rivers. The study found that any damage on the cold-water corals nourished by the current will have a long-lasting effect. After studying the circumpolar current it is clear that it strongly influences regional and global climate as well as underwater biodiversity.

Dr. Adrian Glover of the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum, London</a> says that the current helps preserve wooden shipwrecks by preventing wood-boring "<a href="ship%20worms">ship worms</a>" from reaching targets such as <a href="Ernest%20Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a>'s ship, the <a href="Endurance%20%281912%20ship%29">"Endurance"</a>.

Arbor Day

Arbor Day (or Arbour; from the Latin "arbor", meaning tree) is a <a href="secular%20holiday">holiday</a> in which individuals and groups are encouraged to plant <a href="tree">tree</a>s. Today, many countries observe such a holiday. Though usually observed in the spring, the date varies, depending on <a href="climate">climate</a> and suitable planting season.
The Spanish village of Mondoñedo held the first documented arbor plantation festival in the world organized by its mayor in 1594. The place remains as Alameda de los Remedios and it is still planted with <a href="lime%20%28fruit%29">lime</a> and <a href="Aesculus%20hippocastanum">horse-chestnut</a> trees. A humble granite marker and a bronze plate recall the event. Additionally, the small Spanish village of Villanueva de la Sierra held the first modern Arbor Day, an initiative launched in 1805 by the local priest with the enthusiastic support of the entire population.

The first American Arbor Day was originated in <a href="Nebraska%20City%2C%20Nebraska">Nebraska City, Nebraska</a>, <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a>, by <a href="Julius%20Sterling%20Morton">J. Sterling Morton</a>. On April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted in <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>.

Birdsey Northrop of <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> was responsible for globalizing it when he visited Japan in 1883 and delivered his Arbor Day and Village Improvement message. In that same year, the <a href="American%20Forestry%20Association">American Forestry Association</a> made Northrop the Chairman of the committee to campaign for Arbor Day nationwide. He also brought his enthusiasm for Arbor Day to Australia, Canada, and Europe.

Beginning in 1906, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> conservationist <a href="Major%20Israel%20McCreight">Major Israel McCreight</a> of <a href="DuBois%2C%20Pennsylvania">DuBois, Pennsylvania</a>, argued that President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>’s conservation speeches were limited to businessmen in the lumber industry and recommended a campaign of youth education and a national policy on conservation education. McCreight urged President Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests. Conservationist <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a>, Chief of the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a>, embraced McCreight’s recommendations and asked the President to speak to the public school children of the United States about conservation. On April 15, 1907, Roosevelt issued an "Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States" about the importance of trees and that forestry deserves to be taught in U.S. schools. Pinchot wrote McCreight, "we shall all be indebted to you for having made the suggestion."

National Schools Tree Day is held on the last Friday of July for schools and National Tree Day the last Sunday in July throughout Australia. Many states have Arbor Day although only Victoria has Arbor Week, which was suggested by Premier <a href="Dick%20Hamer">Dick Hamer</a> in the 1980s. Arbor Day has been observed in Australia since 20 June 1889.

International Day of Treeplanting is celebrated in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> on or around 21 March as a theme-day/educational-day/observance, not as public holidays. Tree planting is sometimes combined with awareness campaigns of the fight against cancer: "Kom Op Tegen Kanker".

The Arbor Day (Dia da Árvore) is celebrated on September 21. It's not a national holiday. However, schools nationwide celebrate this day with environment-related activities, namely tree planting.

Arbour Day is celebrated on November 22. It is sponsored by the National Parks Trust of the Virgin Islands. Activities include an annual national Arbour Day Poetry Competition and tree planting ceremonies throughout the territory.

Cambodia celebrates Arbor Day on July 9 with a tree planting ceremony attended by the king.

Founded by Sir George W. Ross, later the Premier of Ontario, when he was Minister of Education in Ontario (1883-1899). According to the Ontario Teachers' Manuals "History of Education" (1915), Ross established both Arbor Day and Empire Day -- "the former to give the school children an interest in making and keeping the school grounds attractive, and the latter to inspire the children with a spirit of patriotism" (p.222). This predates the claimed founding of the day by Don Clark of Schomberg, Ontario for his wife Margret Clark in 1906. In Canada, National Forest Week is the last full week of September, and National Tree Day (Maple Leaf Day) falls on the Wednesday of that week. <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> celebrates Arbour Week from the last Friday in April to the first Sunday in May. <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a> celebrates Arbour Day on the third Friday in May during Arbor Week. Arbor Day is the longest running civic greening project in Calgary and is celebrated on the first Thursday in May. On this day, each grade 1 student in Calgary's schools receives a tree seedling to be taken home to be planted on private property.

National Tree Planting Day is on July 20.

In 1981, the fourth session of the Fifth <a href="National%20People%27s%20Congress">National People's Congress</a> of the <a href="China">People's Republic of China</a> adopted the Resolution on the Unfolding of a Nationwide Voluntary Tree-planting Campaign. This resolution established the Arbor Day () and stipulated that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 should plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in seedling, cultivation, tree tending or other services. Supporting documentation instructs all units to report population statistics to the local afforestation committees as the basis for workload allocation. The People's Republic of China celebrates Arbor Day on March 12, a day founded by Lin Daoyang, continue to use following the date of Arbor Day of Republic of China.

<a href="Van%20Mahotsav">Van Mahotsav</a> is an annual pan-Indian tree planting festival, occupying a week in the month of July. During this event millions of trees are planted. It was initiated in 1950 by K. M. Munshi, the then Union Minister for Agriculture and Food to create an enthusiasm in the mind of the populace for the conservation of forests and planting of trees.

The name Van Mahotsava (the festival of trees) originated in July 1947 after a successful tree-planting drive was undertaken in <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, in which national leaders like <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, <a href="Dr%20Rajendra%20Prasad">Dr Rajendra Prasad</a> and <a href="Abul%20Kalam%20Azad">Abul Kalam Azad</a> participated.

This day is the first day of the "Natural Recyclable Resources Week" (March 5 to <a href="March%2012">12</a>).

This is the time in which the saplings of the all kinds in terms of different climates of different parts of Iran would be shared among the people. They also are going to be taught the ways of planting trees.

The Jewish holiday <a href="Tu%20Bishvat">Tu Bishvat</a>, the new year for trees, is on the 15th day of the month of <a href="Shvat">Shvat</a>, which usually falls in January or February. Originally based on the date used to calculate the age of fruit trees for <a href="Tithe">tithing</a> as mandated in <a href="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 19:23–25, the holiday now is most often observed by planting trees, or raising money to plant trees and by eating fruit, specifically grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives and dates. Tu Bishvat is a semi <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Israel">official holiday in Israel</a>, schools are open but Hebrew speaking schools will often go on tree planting excursions.

Japan celebrates a similarly themed <a href="Greenery%20Day">Greenery Day</a>, held on May 4. Although it has a similar theme to Arbor Day, its roots lie in celebration of the birthday of <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a>.

National Tree Planting Day is usually on March 21 depending on the lunar cycle.

National Tree Planting Day is on the second Saturday in November.

National Tree Planting Day is on November 6.

Having in mind the bad condition of the forest fund, and in particular the catastrophic <a href="wildfires">wildfires</a> which occurred in the summer of 2007, a citizen's initiative for afforestation was started in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>. The campaign by the name 'Tree Day-Plant Your Future' was first organized on 12 March 2008, when an official non-working day was declared and more than 150,000 Macedonians planted 2 million trees in one day (symbolically, one for each citizen). Six million more were planted in November the same year, and another 12,5 million trees in 2009. This has been established as a tradition and takes place every year.

National Tree Planting Day is on the 2nd Monday of December.

The "Día del Árbol" was established in Mexico in 1959 with President <a href="Adolfo%20L%C3%B3pez%20Mateos">Adolfo López Mateos</a> issuing a decree that it should be observed on the 2nd Thursday of July.

National Tree Planting Day is on the 2nd Saturday of May and October. It is first National Tree Planting Day was celebrated on 2010-05-08

Its first Arbor Day was celebrated on October 8, 2004. It takes place annually on the second Friday of October.

Since conference and of the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a>'s publication "<a href="World%20Festival%20of%20Trees">World Festival of Trees</a>", and a resolution of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> in 1954: "The Conference, recognising the need of arousing mass consciousness of the aesthetic, physical and economic value of trees, recommends a World Festival of Trees to be celebrated annually in each member country on a date suited to local conditions"; it has been adopted by the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. In 1957, the National Committee Day of Planting Trees/Foundation of National Festival of Trees ("Nationale Boomplantdag"/"Nationale Boomfeestdag") was created.

On the third Wednesday in March each year (near the spring equinox), three quarters of Dutch schoolchildren aged 10/11 and Dutch celebrities plant trees. Stichting Nationale Boomfeestdag organizes all the activities in the Netherlands for this day. Some municipalities however plant the trees around 21 September because of the planting season.

In 2007, the 50th anniversary was celebrated with special golden jubilee-activities.

<a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>’s first Arbor Day planting was on 3 July 1890 at Greytown, in the Wairarapa. The first official celebration will take place in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> in August 2012, with the planting of <a href="pohutukawa">pohutukawa</a> and <a href="Norfolk%20pines">Norfolk pines</a> along Thorndon Esplanade.

Born in 1855, Dr <a href="Leonard%20Cockayne">Leonard Cockayne</a> (generally recognised as the greatest botanist who has lived, worked, and died in New Zealand) worked extensively on native plants throughout New Zealand and wrote many notable botanical texts. Even as early as the 1920s he held a vision for school students of New Zealand to be involved in planting native trees and plants in their school grounds. This vision bore fruit and schools in New Zealand have long planted native trees on Arbor Day.

Since 1977, New Zealand has celebrated Arbor Day on June 5, which is also <a href="World%20Environment%20Day">World Environment Day</a>, prior to then Arbor Day, in New Zealand, was celebrated on August 4 – which is rather late in the year for tree planting in New Zealand hence the date change.

What the <a href="Department%20of%20Conservation%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Department of Conservation</a> (<a href="Department%20of%20Conservation%20%28New%20Zealand%29">DOC</a>) does for Arbor Day:
Many of DOC's Arbor Day activities focus on ecological restoration projects using native plants to restore habitats that have been damaged or destroyed by humans or invasive pests and weeds. There are great restoration projects underway around New Zealand and many organisations including community groups, landowners, conservation organisations, <a href="iwi">iwi</a>, volunteers, schools, local businesses, nurseries and councils are involved in them. These projects are part of a vision to protect and restore the indigenous biodiversity.

Since 1975, <a href="Niger">Niger</a> has celebrated Arbor Day as part of its <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28Niger%29">Independence Day</a>: 3 August. On this day, aiding the fight against <a href="desertification">desertification</a>, each Nigerien plants a <a href="tree">tree</a>.

National tree plantation day of Pakistan ( قومی شجر کاری دن ) is celebrated on 18 August.

Since 1947, Arbor Day in the Philippines has been institutionalized to be observed throughout the nation by planting trees and ornamental plants and other forms of relevant activities. 
Arbor Day in the Philippines has been commemorated in the Philippines since 1947 when its practice was instituted through Proclamation No. 30. It was subsequently revised by Proclamation No. 41, issued in the same year. In 1955, the commemoration was extended from a day to a week and was moved to the last full week of July. Over two decades later, its commemoration was moved to the second week of June. In 2003, the commemorations were reduced from a week to a day and was moved to June 25 per Proclamation No. 396. The same proclamation directed "the active participation of all government agencies, including government-owned and controlled corporations, private sector, schools, civil society groups and the citizenry in tree planting activity". It was subsequently revised by Proclamation 643 in the succeeding year.

In 2012, Republic Act 10176 was passed, which revived tree planting events "as [a] yearly event for local government units". Since 2012, many local arbor day celebrations have been commemorated, as in the cases of <a href="Natividad%2C%20Pangasinan">Natividad</a> and <a href="Tayug%2C%20Pangasinan">Tayug</a> in Pangasinan and <a href="Santa%20Rita%2C%20Pampanga">Santa Rita</a> in Pampanga.

In Poland, Arbor Day is celebrated since 2002. Each year, on October 10. lots of Polish people plant trees as well as participate in events organized by ecological foundations. Moreover, Polish Forest Inspectorates and schools give special lectures and lead ecological awareness campaigns.

Arbor Day is celebrated on March 21. It's not a national holiday but instead schools nationwide celebrate this day with environment-related activities, namely tree planting.

All-russian day of forest plantation was celebrated first time on 14 May 2011. Now it is held in april-may (it depends on the weather in different <a href="Federal%20subjects%20of%20Russia">regions</a>). 

Arbor Day in Samoa is celebrated on the first Friday in November. 

Arbor Day was celebrated from 1945 until 2000 in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, after that, the national government extended it to National Arbor Week, which lasts annually from 1–7 September. <a href="http%3A//www.plantzafrica.com/miscell/arborweek.htm">Two trees</a>, one common and one rare, are highlighted to increase public awareness of indigenous trees, while various "greening" activities are undertaken by schools, businesses and other organizations.

In Spain is usually held on the <a href="International%20Forest%20Day">International Forest Day</a> on 21 March, but following the 1915 decree spirit that forced to celebrate the Arbor Day throughout Spain, each municipality or collective decides the date for its Arbor Day, usually between February and May. In <a href="Villanueva%20de%20la%20Sierra">Villanueva de la Sierra</a> (<a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a>), where the first Arbor Day in the world was held in 1805, it is celebrated, as on that occasion, on Tuesday Carnaval. It is a great day in the local festive calendar.

As an example of commitment to nature, the small town of <a href="Pescueza">Pescueza</a>, with only 180 inhabitants, organizes every spring a large plantation of holm oaks, which is called the "Festivalino" promoted by city council, several foundations and citizen participation where several thousand people together repopulates naked lands and regaining life. All wrapped up in a fun party atmosphere, joy, music and renew.

National Tree Planting Day is on November 15.

Arbor Day (植樹節) has been a traditional <a href="Holidays%20in%20Taiwan">holiday</a> in the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a> since 1927. In 1914, the founder of the <a href="Nanjing%20Agricultural%20University">agricultural college at Nanking University</a> suggested to the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry that China should imitate the practice in the United States of Arbor Day. The holiday would be held the same day as the <a href="Qingming%20Festival">Qingming Festival</a>. However, for unknown reasons, the suggestion was not made through the formal process, so nothing came from this original request. After the successful conclusion of the <a href="Northern%20Expedition">Northern Expedition</a>, the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Minerals formally petitioned the <a href="Executive%20Yuan">Executive Yuan</a> to establish Arbor Day to commemorate the passing of <a href="Sun%20Yat-sen">Dr. Sun Yat-sen</a>, the Father of Modern China. He had been a major advocate of afforestation in his life, because it would increase <a href="Three%20Principles%20of%20the%20People">people's livelihoods</a>. The Executive Yuan approved Arbor Day in the spirit of Dr. Sun that year and has since been celebrated on March 12 for this purpose.

National Tree Planting Day is on April 1

National Tree Planting Day is on March 24.

First mounted in 1975, National Tree Week is a celebration of the start of the winter tree planting season. Around a million trees are planted each year by schools, community organizations and local authorities.

Arbor Day was founded in 1872 by <a href="Julius%20Sterling%20Morton">J. Sterling Morton</a> in <a href="Nebraska%20City">Nebraska City</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>. By the 1920s, each state in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> had passed public laws that stipulated a certain day to be Arbor Day or "Arbor and Bird Day" observance.

National Arbor Day is celebrated every year on the last Friday in April; it is a <a href="civic%20holiday">civic holiday</a> in <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>. Other <a href="U.S.%20state">states</a> have selected the time of year in which to celebrate their own Arbor Day.

The customary observance is to plant a tree. On the first Arbor Day, April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted.

Venezuela recognizes "Día del Arbol" (Day of the Tree) on the last Sunday of May.

Sir Alfred Jules "Freddie" Ayer, <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20British%20Academy">FBA</a> (; 29 October 1910 – 27 June 1989), usually cited as A. J. Ayer, was a British philosopher known for his promotion of <a href="logical%20positivism">logical positivism</a>, particularly in his books "<a href="Language%2C%20Truth%2C%20and%20Logic">Language, Truth, and Logic</a>" (1936) and "The Problem of Knowledge" (1956).

He was educated at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> and <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a>, after which he studied the philosophy of logical positivism at the <a href="University%20of%20Vienna">University of Vienna</a>. From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> Ayer was a <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> and <a href="MI6">MI6</a> agent.

He was <a href="Grote%20Chair%20of%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind%20and%20Logic">Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic</a> at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become <a href="Wykeham%20Professor">Wykeham Professor</a> of Logic at <a href="New%20College%2C%20Oxford">New College</a>. He was president of the <a href="Aristotelian%20Society">Aristotelian Society</a> from 1951 to 1952 and <a href="knight">knight</a>ed in 1970.

Ayer was born in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>, in north west London, to a wealthy family from continental Europe. His mother, Reine Citroën, was from the Dutch-Jewish family who founded the <a href="Citro%C3%ABn">Citroën</a> car company in France. His father, Jules Ayer, was a Swiss <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> financier who worked for the <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild family</a>.

Ayer was educated at <a href="Ascham%20St%20Vincent%27s%20School">Ascham St Vincent's School</a>, a former boarding preparatory school for boys in the seaside town of <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a> in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, in which he started boarding at the comparatively early age of seven for reasons to do with the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, and <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, a boarding school in <a href="Eton%2C%20Berkshire">Eton</a> (near <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a>) in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>. It was at Eton that Ayer first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity. Although primarily interested in furthering his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the <a href="Eton%20wall%20game">Eton Wall Game</a> very well. In the final examinations at Eton, Ayer came second in his year, and first in classics. In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of <a href="School%20corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> at the school. He won a classics scholarship to <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>.

After graduation from Oxford University Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, "<a href="Language%2C%20Truth%20and%20Logic">Language, Truth and Logic</a>" in 1936. The first exposition in English of <a href="Logical%20Positivism">Logical Positivism</a> as newly developed by the <a href="Vienna%20Circle">Vienna Circle</a>, this made Ayer at age 26 the 'enfant terrible' of British philosophy. In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and <a href="MI6">MI6</a>). Ayer was commissioned <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> into the <a href="Welsh%20Guards">Welsh Guards</a> from Officer Cadet Training Unit on 21 September 1940.

After the war he briefly returned to <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> where he became a fellow and <a href="Dean%20of%20Wadham%20College">Dean of Wadham College</a>. He thereafter taught philosophy at <a href="London%20University">London University</a> from 1946 until 1959, when he also started to appear on radio and television. He was an extrovert and social mixer who liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York. He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of the <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> football team. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high society' and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.

Ayer was married four times to three women. His first marriage was from 1932–1941 to (Grace Isabel) Renée (d. 1980), who subsequently married philosopher <a href="Stuart%20Hampshire">Stuart Hampshire</a>, Ayer's friend and colleague. In 1960 he married <a href="Dee%20Wells">Alberta Constance (Dee) Wells</a>, with whom he had one son. Ayer's marriage to Wells was dissolved in 1983 and that same year he married Vanessa Salmon, former wife of politician <a href="Nigel%20Lawson">Nigel Lawson</a>. She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried Dee Wells, who survived him. Ayer also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist <a href="Sheilah%20Graham%20Westbrook">Sheilah Graham Westbrook</a>.

From 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir Alfred held the Wykeham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford. He was knighted in 1970.

Ayer died on 27 June 1989. From 1980 to 1989, Ayer lived at 51 York Street, <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>, where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.

In "Language, Truth and Logic" (1936), Ayer presents the <a href="verification%20principle">verification principle</a> as the only valid basis for philosophy. Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like "God exists" or "charity is good" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored. Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. He also criticises C. A. Mace's opinion that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry. The stance of a person who believes "God" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as <a href="Ignosticism">igtheism</a> (for example, by <a href="Paul%20Kurtz">Paul Kurtz</a>). In later years Ayer reiterated that he did not believe in God and began to refer to himself as an atheist. He followed in the footsteps of <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> by debating with the Jesuit scholar <a href="Frederick%20Copleston">Frederick Copleston</a> on the topic of religion.

Ayer's version of emotivism divides "the ordinary system of ethics" into four classes:
He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in <a href="normative%20ethics">normative ethics</a> as opposed to <a href="meta-ethics">meta-ethics</a>) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.

Ayer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with <a href="ethical%20intuitionism">ethical intuitionists</a>. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition of non-empirical moral truths as "worthless" since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are "mere pseudo-concepts":

Between 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, he contributed a series of articles to "<a href="Polemic%20%28magazine%29">Polemic</a>", a short-lived British "Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics" edited by the ex-Communist <a href="Humphrey%20Slater">Humphrey Slater</a>.

Ayer was closely associated with the British <a href="secular%20humanism">humanist</a> movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the <a href="Rationalist%20Press%20Association">Rationalist Press Association</a> from 1947 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1963. In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded <a href="Julian%20Huxley">Julian Huxley</a> as president of the <a href="British%20Humanist%20Association">British Humanist Association</a>, a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited "The Humanist Outlook", a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. In addition he was one of the signers of the <a href="Humanist%20Manifesto%20II">Humanist Manifesto</a>.

He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at <a href="Bard%20College">Bard College</a> in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer <a href="Fernando%20Sanchez">Fernando Sanchez</a>, Ayer, then 77, confronted <a href="Mike%20Tyson">Mike Tyson</a> who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model <a href="Naomi%20Campbell">Naomi Campbell</a>. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: "Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world," to which Ayer replied: "And I am the former <a href="Wykeham%20Professor%20of%20Logic">Wykeham Professor of Logic</a>. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men". Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, while Naomi Campbell slipped out.

In 1988, shortly before his death, Ayer wrote an article entitled, "What I saw when I was dead", describing an unusual <a href="near-death%20experience">near-death experience</a>. Of the experience, Ayer first said that it "slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be." However, a few days later he revised this, saying "what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief".

In 2001 Dr Jeremy George, the attending physician, claimed that Ayer had confided to him: "I saw a Divine Being. I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions." Ayer's son Nick, however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.

Ayer is best known for popularising the <a href="verification%20principle">verification principle</a>, in particular through his presentation of it in "<a href="Language%2C%20Truth%2C%20and%20Logic">Language, Truth, and Logic</a>" (1936). The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called <a href="Vienna%20Circle">Vienna Circle</a> which Ayer visited as a young guest. Others, including the leading light of the circle, <a href="Moritz%20Schlick">Moritz Schlick</a>, were already offering their own papers on the issue. Ayer's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable <a href="empirical">empirical</a> import, otherwise it is either "<a href="Analytic-synthetic%20distinction">analytical</a>" if <a href="Tautology%20%28logic%29">tautologous</a>, or "metaphysical" (i.e. meaningless, or "literally senseless"). He started to work on the book at the age of 23 and it was published when he was 26. Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes "Language, Truth and Logic" essential reading on the tenets of <a href="logical%20empiricism">logical empiricism</a>– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century <a href="analytic%20philosophy">analytic philosophy</a>, and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour', an argument which anticipates the <a href="Turing%20test">Turing test</a> published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.

Ayer wrote two books on the philosopher <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, "Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage" (1971) and "Russell" (1972). He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a> and a short biography of <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>.

Ayer was a strong critic of the German philosopher <a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a>. As a logical positivist Ayer was in conflict with Heidegger's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence. These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.

In 1972–1973 Ayer gave the <a href="Gifford%20Lectures">Gifford Lectures</a> at <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">University of St Andrews</a>, later published as "The Central Questions of Philosophy". In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord Gifford wished to promote '"Natural Theology", in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are "able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth". He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called "philosophy"– including the whole of <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, theology and <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.

In "The Concept of a Person and Other Essays" (1963), Ayer heavily criticized <a href="Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</a>'s <a href="private%20language%20argument">private language argument</a>.

Ayer's sense-data theory in "Foundations of Empirical Knowledge" was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian <a href="J.%20L.%20Austin">J. L. Austin</a> in "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibilia%20%28Austin%29">Sense and Sensibilia</a>", a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy. Ayer responded to this in the essay "Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?", which can be found in his "Metaphysics and Common Sense" (1969).

He was awarded a Knighthood as <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> in the London Gazette on 1 January 1970.

André Weil

André Weil (; ; 6 May 1906 – 6 August 1998) was an influential French <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> of the 20th century, known for his foundational work in <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> and <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>. He was a founding member and the "de facto" early leader of the <a href="Bourbaki%20group">Bourbaki group</a>. The <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> <a href="Simone%20Weil">Simone Weil</a> was his sister.

André Weil was born in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to <a href="agnosticism">agnostic</a> <a href="Alsatian%20Jew">Alsatian Jew</a>ish parents who fled the annexation of <a href="Alsace-Lorraine">Alsace-Lorraine</a> by the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> after the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> in 1870–71. The famous philosopher <a href="Simone%20Weil">Simone Weil</a> was Weil's only sibling. He studied in Paris, <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a> and received his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">doctorate</a> in 1928. While in Germany, Weil befriended <a href="Carl%20Ludwig%20Siegel">Carl Ludwig Siegel</a>. Starting in 1930, he spent two academic years at <a href="Aligarh%20Muslim%20University">Aligarh Muslim University</a>. Aside from mathematics, Weil held lifelong interests in classical Greek and Latin literature, in <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="Sanskrit%20literature">Sanskrit literature</a>: he taught himself Sanskrit in 1920. After teaching for one year in <a href="Aix-Marseille%20University">Aix-Marseille University</a>, he taught for six years in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. He married Éveline in 1937.

Weil was in <a href="Finland">Finland</a> when <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. His wife Éveline returned to France without him. Weil was mistakenly arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the <a href="Winter%20War">Winter War</a> on suspicion of spying; however, accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated. Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that Weil completed the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he requested to be attached to a military unit instead, and was given the chance to join a regiment in <a href="Cherbourg-Octeville">Cherbourg</a>. After the <a href="fall%20of%20France">fall of France</a>, he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to <a href="Clermont-Ferrand">Clermont-Ferrand</a>, where he managed to join his wife Éveline, who had been living in German-occupied France.

In January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> to New York. He spent the remainder of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a> and the <a href="John%20Simon%20Guggenheim%20Memorial%20Foundation">Guggenheim Foundation</a>. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at <a href="Lehigh%20University">Lehigh University</a>, where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he didn't have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. But, he hated Lehigh very much for their heavy teaching workload and he swore that he would never talk about "Lehigh" any more. He quit the job at Lehigh, and then he moved to Brazil and taught at the <a href="Universidade%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">Universidade de São Paulo</a> from 1945 to 1947, where he worked with <a href="Oscar%20Zariski">Oscar Zariski</a>. He then returned to the United States and taught at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a>, where he would spend the remainder of his career. He was a Plenary Speaker at the <a href="International%20Congress%20of%20Mathematicians">ICM</a> in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1954 in Amsterdam, and in 1978 in Helsinki. In 1979, Weil shared the second <a href="Wolf%20Prize%20in%20Mathematics">Wolf Prize in Mathematics</a> with Jean Leray.

Weil made substantial contributions in a number of areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a> and <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>. This began in his doctoral work leading to the <a href="Mordell%E2%80%93Weil%20theorem">Mordell–Weil theorem</a> (1928, and shortly applied in <a href="Siegel%27s%20theorem%20on%20integral%20points">Siegel's theorem on integral points</a>). <a href="Mordell%27s%20theorem">Mordell's theorem</a> had an "ad hoc" proof; Weil began the separation of the <a href="infinite%20descent">infinite descent</a> argument into two types of structural approach, by means of <a href="height%20function">height function</a>s for sizing rational points, and by means of <a href="Galois%20cohomology">Galois cohomology</a>, which would not be categorized as such for another two decades. Both aspects of Weil's work have steadily developed into substantial theories.

Among his major accomplishments were the 1940s proof of the <a href="Weil%20conjectures">Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions</a> of curves over finite fields, and his subsequent laying of proper <a href="foundations%20for%20algebraic%20geometry">foundations for algebraic geometry</a> to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively). The so-called <a href="Weil%20conjectures">Weil conjectures</a> were hugely influential from around 1950; these statements were later proved by <a href="Bernard%20Dwork">Bernard Dwork</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Grothendieck">Alexander Grothendieck</a>, <a href="Michael%20Artin">Michael Artin</a>, and finally by <a href="Pierre%20Deligne">Pierre Deligne</a>, who completed the most difficult step in 1973.

Weil introduced the <a href="adele%20ring">adele ring</a> in the late 1930s, following <a href="Claude%20Chevalley">Claude Chevalley</a>'s lead with the <a href="idele">idele</a>s, and gave a proof of the <a href="Riemann%E2%80%93Roch%20theorem">Riemann–Roch theorem</a> with them (a version appeared in his "Basic Number Theory" in 1967). His 'matrix divisor' (<a href="vector%20bundle">vector bundle</a> "avant la lettre") Riemann–Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The <a href="Weil%20conjecture%20on%20Tamagawa%20numbers">Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers</a> proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in <a href="automorphic%20representation">automorphic representation</a> theory. He picked up another credited "Weil conjecture", around 1967, which later under pressure from <a href="Serge%20Lang">Serge Lang</a> (resp. of Serre) became known as the <a href="Taniyama%E2%80%93Shimura%20conjecture">Taniyama–Shimura conjecture</a> (resp. Taniyama–Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.

Other significant results were on <a href="Pontryagin%20duality">Pontryagin duality</a> and <a href="differential%20geometry">differential geometry</a>. He introduced the concept of a <a href="uniform%20space">uniform space</a> in <a href="general%20topology">general topology</a>, as a by-product of his collaboration with Nicolas Bourbaki (of which he was a Founding Father). His work on <a href="sheaf%20theory">sheaf theory</a> hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with <a href="Henri%20Cartan">Henri Cartan</a> in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential.

He discovered that the so-called <a href="Weil%20representation">Weil representation</a>, previously introduced in <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> by <a href="Irving%20Segal">Irving Segal</a> and Shale, gave a contemporary framework for understanding the classical theory of <a href="quadratic%20form">quadratic form</a>s. This was also a beginning of a substantial development by others, connecting <a href="representation%20theory">representation theory</a> and <a href="theta%20function">theta function</a>s.

He also wrote several books on the history of Number Theory. Weil was elected <a href="List%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20elected%20in%201966">Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1966</a>.

Weil's ideas made an important contribution to the writings and seminars of <a href="Nicolas%20Bourbaki">Bourbaki</a>, before and after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

He says on page 114 of his <a href="%23autobiography">autobiography</a> that he was responsible for the null set symbol (Ø) and that it came from the <a href="Norwegian%20alphabet">Norwegian alphabet</a>, which he alone among the Bourbaki group was familiar with.

<a href="Hindu%20philosophy">Indian (Hindu) thought</a> had great influence on Weil. Although he was an agnostic, he respected religions.

Achaeans (Homer)

The Achaeans (; "Akhaioí," "the Achaeans" or "of Achaea") constitute one of the <a href="Names%20of%20the%20Greeks">collective names</a> for the <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" (used 598 times) and "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>". The other common names are Danaans (; "Danaoi"; used 138 times in the "Iliad") and Argives (; ; used 182 times in the "Iliad") while Panhellenes ( "Panhellenes," "All of the Greeks") and Hellenes (; "Hellenes") both <a href="hapax%20legomenon">appear only once</a>; all of the aforementioned terms were used synonymously to denote a common Greek civilizational identity. In the historical period, the Achaeans were the inhabitants of the region of <a href="Achaea%20%28ancient%20region%29%23Name">Achaea</a>, a region in the north-central part of the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. The city-states of this region later formed a confederation known as the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a>, which was influential during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.

The Homeric "long-haired Achaeans" would have been a part of the <a href="Mycenaean%20civilization">Mycenaean civilization</a> that dominated Greece from circa 1600 BC until 1100 BC. Later, by the <a href="Archaic%20Greece">Archaic</a> and <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical</a> periods, the term "Achaeans" referred to inhabitants of the much smaller region of <a href="Achaea%20%28ancient%20region%29">Achaea</a>. <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> identified the <a href="Achaea%20%28ancient%20region%29">Achaeans</a> of the northern <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans. According to <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, writing in the 2nd century CE, the term "Achaean" was originally given to those Greeks inhabiting the <a href="Argolis">Argolis</a> and <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a>.

Pausanias and Herodotus both recount the legend that the Achaeans were forced from their homelands by the <a href="Dorians">Dorians</a>, during the legendary <a href="Dorian%20invasion">Dorian invasion</a> of the Peloponnese. They then moved into the region later called Achaea.

A scholarly consensus has not yet been reached on the origin of the historic Achaeans relative to the Homeric Achaeans and is still hotly debated. Former emphasis on presumed race, such as John A. Scott's article about the blond locks of the Achaeans as compared to the dark locks of "Mediterranean" <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>, on the basis of hints in Homer, has been rejected by some. The contrasting belief that "Achaeans", as understood through Homer, is "a name without a country", an "ethnos" created in the <a href="Epic%20Cycle">Epic tradition</a>, has modern supporters among those who conclude that "Achaeans" were redefined in the 5th century BC, as contemporary speakers of <a href="Aeolic%20Greek">Aeolic Greek</a>.

<a href="Karl%20Beloch">Karl Beloch</a> suggested there was no Dorian invasion, but rather that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans. <a href="Eduard%20Meyer">Eduard Meyer</a>, disagreeing with Beloch, instead put forth the suggestion that the real-life Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks. His conclusion is based on his research on the similarity between the languages of the Achaeans and pre-historic Arcadians. William Prentice disagreed with both, noting archeological evidence suggests the Achaeans instead migrated from "southern <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> to Greece, probably settling first in lower <a href="Ancient%20Thessaly">Thessaly</a>" probably prior to 2000 BC.

<a href="Emil%20Forrer">Emil Forrer</a>, a <a href="Swiss%20people">Swiss</a> Hittitologist who worked on the Boghazköy tablets in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, said the Achaeans of pre-Homeric Greece were directly associated with the term "Land of Ahhiyawa" mentioned in the Hittite texts. His conclusions at the time were challenged by other Hittitologists (i.e. <a href="Johannes%20Friedrich%20%28linguist%29">Johannes Friedrich</a> in 1927 and <a href="Albrecht%20Goetze">Albrecht Götze</a> in 1930), as well as by Ferdinand Sommer, who published his "Die Ahhijava-Urkunden" ("The Ahhiyawa Documents") in 1932.
Some <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite</a> texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyawa. In the earliest reference to this land, a letter outlining the treaty violations of the Hittite vassal <a href="Madduwatta">Madduwatta</a>, it is called "Ahhiya". Another important example is the "<a href="Tawagalawa%20Letter">Tawagalawa Letter</a>" written by an unnamed <a href="Hittites">Hittite</a> king (most probably <a href="Hattusili%20III">Hattusili III</a>) of the empire period (14th–13th century BC) to the king of "Ahhiyawa", treating him as an equal and implying <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> ("Millawanda") was under his control. It also refers to an earlier ""Wilusa" episode" involving hostility on the part of "Ahhiyawa". Ahhiya(wa) has been identified with the Achaeans of the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a> and the city of <a href="Wilusa">Wilusa</a> with the legendary city of <a href="Troy">Troy</a> (note the similarity with early Greek "Wilion", later "Ilion", the name of the <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a> of Troy). The exact relationship of the term "Ahhiyawa" to the Achaeans beyond a similarity in pronunciation was hotly debated by scholars, even following the discovery that Mycenaean <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> is an early form of Greek; the earlier debate was summed up in 1984 by <a href="Hans%20G.%20G%C3%BCterbock">Hans G. Güterbock</a> of the <a href="Oriental%20Institute%2C%20Chicago">Oriental Institute</a>. More recent research based on new readings and interpretations of the Hittite texts, as well as of the material evidence for Mycenaean contacts with the Anatolian mainland, came to the conclusion that "Ahhiyawa" referred to the Mycenaean world, or at least to a part of it.

It has been proposed that "Ekwesh" of the Egyptian records may relate to "Achaea" (compared to Hittite "Ahhiyawa"), whereas "<a href="Denyen">Denyen</a>" and "Tanaju" may relate to Classical Greek "Danaoi". The earliest textual reference to the Mycenaean world is in the Annals of <a href="Thutmosis%20III">Thutmosis III</a> (ca. 1479–1425 BC), which refers to messengers from the king of the Tanaju, circa 1437 BC, offering greeting gifts to the Egyptian king, in order to initiate diplomatic relations, when the latter campaigned in Syria. Tanaju is also listed in an inscription at the <a href="Mortuary%20Temple%20of%20Amenhotep%20III">Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III</a>. The latter ruled Egypt in circa 1382–1344 BC. Moreover, a list of the cities and regions of the Tanaju is also mentioned in this inscription; among the cities listed are Mycenae, <a href="Nauplion">Nauplion</a>, <a href="Kythera">Kythera</a>, <a href="Messenia">Messenia</a> and the Thebaid (region of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>).

During the 5th year of Pharaoh <a href="Merneptah">Merneptah</a>, a confederation of <a href="Libya">Libya</a>n and northern peoples is supposed to have attacked the western delta. Included amongst the ethnic names of the repulsed invaders is the <a href="Ekwesh">Ekwesh</a> or Eqwesh, whom some have seen as Achaeans, although Egyptian texts specifically mention these Ekwesh to be <a href="circumcised">circumcised</a> (which does not seem to have been a general practice in the Aegean at the time). Homer mentions an Achaean attack upon the delta, and <a href="Menelaus">Menelaus</a> speaks of the same in Book IV of the "Odyssey" to <a href="Telemachus">Telemachus</a> when he recounts his own return home from the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. Later Greek myths also say Helen had spent the time of the Trojan War in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and not at <a href="Troy">Troy</a>, and that after Troy the <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> went there to recover her.

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the perceived cultural divisions among the Hellenes were represented as legendary lines of descent that identified kinship groups, with each line being derived from an <a href="eponymy">eponymous</a> ancestor. Each of the Greek "<a href="Ethnic%20group">ethne</a>" were said to be named in honor of their respective ancestors: <a href="Achaeus%20%28son%20of%20Xuthus%29">Achaeus</a> of the Achaeans, <a href="Danaus">Danaus</a> of the Danaans, <a href="Cadmus">Cadmus</a> of the Cadmeans (<a href="Ancient%20Thebes%20%28Boeotia%29">the Thebans</a>), <a href="Hellen">Hellen</a> of the Hellenes (not to be confused with <a href="Helen%20of%20Troy">Helen of Troy</a>), <a href="Aeolus">Aeolus</a> of the <a href="Aeolians">Aeolians</a>, <a href="Ion%20%28mythology%29">Ion</a> of the <a href="Ionians">Ionians</a>, and <a href="Dorus">Dorus</a> of the <a href="Dorians">Dorians</a>.

Cadmus from <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>, Danaus from <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and Pelops from <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> each gained a foothold in mainland Greece and were assimilated and Hellenized. Hellen, Graikos, Magnes, and Macedon were sons of <a href="Deucalion">Deucalion</a> and <a href="Pyrrha">Pyrrha</a>, the only people who survived the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20flood%20myths">Great Flood</a>; the "ethne" were said to have originally been named "Graikoi" after the elder son but later renamed "Hellenes" after Hellen who was proved to be the strongest. Sons of Hellen and the nymph <a href="Orseis">Orseis</a> were Dorus, Xuthos, and <a href="Aeolus%20%28son%20of%20Hellen%29">Aeolus</a>. Sons of Xuthos and Kreousa, daughter of Erechthea, were Ion and Achaeus.

According to <a href="Hyginus">Hyginus</a>, 22 Achaeans killed 362 Trojans during their ten years at <a href="Troy">Troy</a>.

According to Margalit Finkelberg, the name Ἀχαιοί/Ἀχαιϝοί is derived from <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite</a> "Aḫḫiyawā". However, <a href="Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes">Robert S. P. Beekes</a> doubted the validity of this derivation and suggested a <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> proto-form "*Akaya-".
The etymology of "Danaoi" is uncertain; according to Beekes "the name is certainly <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a>".

Atle Selberg

Atle Selberg (14 June 1917 – 6 August 2007) was a Norwegian <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> known for his work in <a href="analytic%20number%20theory">analytic number theory</a>, and in the theory of <a href="automorphic%20form">automorphic form</a>s, in particular bringing them into relation with <a href="spectral%20theory">spectral theory</a>. He was awarded the <a href="Fields%20Medal">Fields Medal</a> in 1950.

Selberg was born in <a href="Langesund">Langesund</a>, Norway, the son of teacher Anna Kristina Selberg and mathematician <a href="Ole%20Michael%20Ludvigsen%20Selberg">Ole Michael Ludvigsen Selberg</a>. Two of his brothers also went on to become mathematicians as well, and the remaining one became a professor of engineering. 

While he was still at school he was influenced by the work of <a href="Srinivasa%20Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a> and he found an exact analytical formula for the <a href="Partition%20%28number%20theory%29%23Partition%20function">partition function</a> as suggested by the works of Ramanujan; however, this result was first published by <a href="Hans%20Rademacher">Hans Rademacher</a>. During the war he fought against the German invasion of Norway, and was imprisoned several times. 
He studied at the <a href="University%20of%20Oslo">University of Oslo</a> and completed his <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> in 1943.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Selberg worked in isolation due to the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Norway">German occupation of Norway</a>. After the war his accomplishments became known, including a proof that a positive proportion of the zeros of the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a> lie on the line formula_1. 
After the war, he turned to <a href="sieve%20theory">sieve theory</a>, a previously neglected topic which Selberg's work brought into prominence. In a 1947 paper he introduced the <a href="Selberg%20sieve">Selberg sieve</a>, a method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds, and which contributed to <a href="Chen%27s%20theorem">Chen's theorem</a>, among other important results.

In 1948 Selberg submitted two papers in "<a href="Annals%20of%20Mathematics">Annals of Mathematics</a>" in which he proved by elementary means the theorems for <a href="primes%20in%20arithmetic%20progression">primes in arithmetic progression</a> and the <a href="prime%20number%20theorem">density of primes</a>. This challenged the widely held view of his time that certain theorems are only obtainable with the advanced methods of <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a>. Both results were based on his work on the asymptotic formula
where
for primes formula_4. He established this result by elementary means in March 1948, and by July of that year, Selberg and <a href="Paul%20Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erdős</a> each obtained <a href="elementary%20proof">elementary proof</a>s of the <a href="prime%20number%20theorem">prime number theorem</a>, both using the asymptotic formula above as a starting point. Circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between the two mathematicians.

For his fundamental accomplishments during the 1940s, Selberg received the 1950 <a href="Fields%20Medal">Fields Medal</a>.

Selberg moved to the United States and settled at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a> in the 1950s where he remained until his death. During the 1950s he worked on introducing <a href="spectral%20theory">spectral theory</a> into <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>, culminating in his development of the <a href="Selberg%20trace%20formula">Selberg trace formula</a>, the most famous and influential of his results. In its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of <a href="closed%20geodesic">closed geodesic</a>s on a <a href="compact%20Riemann%20surface">compact Riemann surface</a> and the <a href="eigenvalue">eigenvalue</a>s of the <a href="Laplace-Beltrami%20operator">Laplacian</a>, which is analogous to the duality between the <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s and the zeros of the zeta function.

He was awarded the 1986 <a href="Wolf%20Prize%20in%20Mathematics">Wolf Prize in Mathematics</a>. He was also awarded an honorary <a href="Abel%20Prize">Abel Prize</a> in 2002, its founding year, before the awarding of the regular prizes began.

Aeschylus

Aeschylus ( or ; "Aiskhulos"; ; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an <a href="Greek%20tragedy">ancient Greek tragedian</a>. He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. According to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, he expanded the number of characters in theater allowing conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the <a href="Greek%20chorus">chorus</a>.

Only seven of his estimated seventy to ninety plays have survived, and there is a longstanding <a href="Prometheus%20Bound%23Debate%20over%20authenticity">debate regarding his authorship of one of these plays</a>, "<a href="Prometheus%20Bound">Prometheus Bound</a>", which some believe his son <a href="Euphorion%20%28playwright%29">Euphorion</a> actually wrote. Fragments of some other plays have survived in quotes and more continue to be discovered on Egyptian <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>, often giving us surprising insights into his work. He was probably the first dramatist to present plays as a trilogy; his "<a href="Oresteia">Oresteia</a>" is the only ancient example of the form to have survived. At least one of his plays was influenced by the <a href="Persian%20Wars">Persians' second invasion of Greece</a> (480–479 BC). This work, "<a href="The%20Persians">The Persians</a>", is the only surviving classical Greek tragedy concerned with contemporary events (very few of that kind were ever written), and a useful source of information about its period. The significance of war in Ancient Greek culture was so great that Aeschylus' epitaph commemorates his participation in the Greek victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Marathon">Marathon</a> while making no mention of his success as a playwright. Despite this, Aeschylus' work – particularly the "Oresteia" "–" is generally acclaimed by modern critics and scholars.

Aeschylus was born in c. 525 BC in <a href="Eleusis">Eleusis</a>, a small town about 27 kilometers northwest of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, which is nestled in the fertile valleys of western <a href="Attica">Attica</a>, though the date is most likely based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. His family was wealthy and well established; his father, Euphorion, was a member of the <a href="Eupatridae">Eupatridae</a>, the ancient nobility of Attica, though this might be a fiction that the ancients invented to account for the grandeur of his plays.

As a youth, he worked at a vineyard until, according to the 2nd-century AD geographer <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, the god <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy. As soon as he woke from the dream, the young Aeschylus began to write a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was only 26 years old. He won his first victory at the <a href="City%20Dionysia">City Dionysia</a> in 484 BC.

In 510 BC, when Aeschylus was 15 years old, <a href="Cleomenes%20I">Cleomenes I</a> expelled the sons of <a href="Peisistratos">Peisistratus</a> from Athens, and <a href="Cleisthenes">Cleisthenes</a> came to power. Cleisthenes' reforms included a system of registration that emphasized the importance of the <a href="deme">deme</a> over family tradition. In the last decade of the 6th century, Aeschylus and his family were living in the deme of <a href="Eleusis">Eleusis</a>.

The <a href="Persian%20Wars">Persian Wars</a> played a large role in the playwright's life and career. In 490 BC, Aeschylus and his brother <a href="Cynegeirus">Cynegeirus</a> fought to defend Athens against the invading army of <a href="Darius%20I%20of%20Persia">Darius I of Persia</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marathon">Battle of Marathon</a>. The Athenians emerged triumphant, a victory celebrated across the city-states of Greece. Cynegeirus, however, died in the battle, receiving a mortal wound while trying to prevent a Persian ship retreating from the shore, for which his countrymen extolled him as a hero.

In 480, Aeschylus was called into military service again, this time against <a href="Xerxes%20I%20of%20Persia">Xerxes I</a>'s invading forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Battle of Salamis</a>, and perhaps, too, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Plataea">Battle of Plataea</a> in 479. <a href="Ion%20of%20Chios">Ion of Chios</a> was a witness for Aeschylus's war record and his contribution in Salamis. Salamis holds a prominent place in "The Persians", his oldest surviving <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">play</a>, which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the <a href="Dionysia">Dionysia</a>.

Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who were initiated into the <a href="Eleusinian%20Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a>, an ancient cult of <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a> based in his hometown of Eleusis. Initiates gained secret knowledge through these rites, likely concerning the afterlife. Firm details of specific rites are sparse, as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal anything about the Mysteries to non-initiates. Nevertheless, according to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, Aeschylus was accused of revealing some of the cult's secrets on stage.

Other sources claim that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. <a href="Heracleides%20of%20Pontus">Heracleides of Pontus</a> asserts that the audience tried to stone Aeschylus. He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother <a href="Ameinias%20of%20Athens">Ameinias</a> helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. The truth is that the award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.

Aeschylus travelled to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> once or twice in the 470s BC, having been invited by <a href="Hiero%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20of%20Syracuse">Hiero I of Syracuse</a>, a major Greek city on the eastern side of the island; and during one of these trips he produced "The Women of Aetna" (in honor of the city founded by Hieron) and restaged his "Persians". By 473 BC, after the death of <a href="Phrynichus%20%28tragic%20poet%29">Phrynichus</a>, one of his chief rivals, Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia, winning first prize in nearly every competition. In 472 BC, Aeschylus staged the production that included the "Persians", with <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> serving as "<a href="choregos">choregos</a>".

In 458 BC, he returned to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of <a href="Gela">Gela</a> where he died in 456 or 455 BC. <a href="Valerius%20Maximus">Valerius Maximus</a> wrote that he was killed outside the city by a <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a> dropped by an eagle which had mistaken his bald head for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile. <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a>, in his "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Naturalis Historiæ</a>", adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid a prophecy that he would be killed by a falling object. But this story may be legendary and due to a misunderstanding of the iconography on Aeschylus's tomb. Aeschylus's work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also became playwrights.

The inscription on Aeschylus's gravestone makes no mention of his <a href="Theatre">theatrical</a> renown, commemorating only his military achievements:

According to Castoriadis, the inscription on his grave signifies the primary importance of "belonging to the City" (<a href="polis">polis</a>), of the solidarity that existed within the collective body of citizen-soldiers.

Aeschylus married and had two sons, <a href="Euphorion%20%28playwright%29">Euphorion</a> and Euaeon, both of whom became tragic poets. Euphorion won first prize in 431 in competition against both <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> and <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>. His nephew, <a href="Philocles">Philocles</a> (his sister's son), was also a tragic poet, and won first prize in the competition against <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>' "<a href="Oedipus%20Rex">Oedipus Rex</a>". Aeschylus had at least two brothers, <a href="Cynegeirus">Cynegeirus</a> and <a href="Ameinias%20of%20Athens">Ameinias</a>.

The roots of Greek drama are in religious festivals for the gods, chiefly <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, the god of wine. During Aeschylus's lifetime, dramatic competitions became part of the <a href="City%20Dionysia">City Dionysia</a> in the spring. The festival opened with a procession, followed with a competition of boys singing <a href="dithyramb">dithyramb</a>s and culminated in a pair of dramatic competitions. The first competition Aeschylus would have participated in, consisted of three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays followed by a shorter comedic <a href="satyr%20play">satyr play</a>. A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed, and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges.

Aeschylus entered many of these competitions in his lifetime, and various ancient sources attribute between seventy and ninety plays to him. Only seven tragedies have survived intact: "<a href="The%20Persians">The Persians</a>", "<a href="Seven%20against%20Thebes">Seven against Thebes</a>", "<a href="The%20Suppliants%20%28Aeschylus%29">The Suppliants</a>", the trilogy known as "<a href="The%20Oresteia">The Oresteia</a>", consisting of the three tragedies "<a href="Agamemnon%20%28play%29%23Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>", "<a href="Oresteia%23The%20Libation%20Bearers">The Libation Bearers</a>" and "<a href="The%20Eumenides%23The%20Eumenides">The Eumenides</a>", together with "<a href="Prometheus%20Bound">Prometheus Bound</a>" (whose authorship is disputed). With the exception of this last play – the success of which is uncertain – all of Aeschylus's <a href="Extant%20literature">extant</a> tragedies are known to have won first prize at the City Dionysia.

The Alexandrian "Life of Aeschylus" claims that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times. This compares favorably with Sophocles' reported eighteen victories (with a substantially larger catalogue, at an estimated 120 plays), and dwarfs the five victories of Euripides, who is thought to have written roughly 90 plays.

One hallmark of Aeschylean <a href="dramaturgy">dramaturgy</a> appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies, in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative. "<a href="The%20Oresteia">The Oresteia</a>" is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies. The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths.

For example, the "Oresteia"'s satyr play "<a href="Proteus">Proteus</a>" treated the story of Menelaus' detour in Egypt on his way home from the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, <a href="scholia">scholia</a>, and play fragments recorded by later authors, it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: "Seven against Thebes" being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and "The Suppliants" and "Prometheus Bound" each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively (see below). Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles. A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War. One, collectively called the "<a href="Achilleis%20%28trilogy%29">Achilleis</a>", comprised the titles "Myrmidons", "Nereids" and "Phrygians" (alternately, "The Ransoming of Hector").

Another trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally <a href="Memnon%20%28mythology%29">Memnon</a> into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles ("Memnon" and "The Weighing of Souls" being two components of the trilogy); "The Award of the Arms", "The Phrygian Women", and "The Salaminian Women" suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero <a href="Ajax%20the%20great">Ajax</a>; Aeschylus also seems to have written about <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>' return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife <a href="Penelope">Penelope</a>'s suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of "The Soul-raisers", "Penelope" and "The Bone-gatherers". Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts ("Argô", "Lemnian Women", "Hypsipylê"); the life of Perseus ("The Net-draggers", "Polydektês", "Phorkides"); the birth and exploits of Dionysus ("Semele", "Bacchae", "Pentheus"); and the aftermath of the war portrayed in "Seven against Thebes" ("Eleusinians", "Argives" (or "Argive Women"), "Sons of the Seven").

The earliest of his plays to survive is "The Persians" ("Persai"), performed in 472 BC and based on experiences in Aeschylus's own life, specifically the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Battle of Salamis</a>. It is unique among surviving Greek tragedies in that it describes a recent historical event. "The Persians" focuses on the popular Greek theme of "<a href="hubris">hubris</a>" by blaming Persia's loss on the pride of its king.

It opens with the arrival of a messenger in <a href="Susa">Susa</a>, the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis to <a href="Atossa">Atossa</a>, the mother of the Persian King <a href="Xerxes%20I%20of%20Persia">Xerxes</a>. Atossa then travels to the tomb of Darius, her husband, where his ghost appears to explain the cause of the defeat. It is, he says, the result of Xerxes' hubris in building a bridge across the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>, an action which angered the gods. Xerxes appears at the end of the play, not realizing the cause of his defeat, and the play closes to lamentations by Xerxes and the chorus.

"Seven against Thebes" ("Hepta epi Thebas"), which was performed in 467 BC, has the contrasting theme of the interference of the gods in human affairs. It also marks the first known appearance in Aeschylus's work of a theme which would continue through his plays, that of the <a href="polis">polis</a> (the city) being a key development of human civilization.

The play tells the story of <a href="Eteocles">Eteocles</a> and <a href="Polynices">Polynices</a>, the sons of the shamed King of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>, <a href="Oedipus">Oedipus</a>. The sons agree to alternate in the throne of the city, but after the first year Eteocles refuses to step down, and Polynices wages war to claim his crown. The brothers kill each other in single combat, and the original ending of the play consisted of lamentations for the dead brothers.

A new ending was added to the play some fifty years later: Antigone and Ismene mourn their dead brothers, a messenger enters announcing an edict prohibiting the burial of Polynices; and finally, Antigone declares her intention to defy this edict. The play was the third in a connected Oedipus trilogy; the first two plays were "Laius" and "Oedipus". The concluding <a href="satyr%20play">satyr play</a> was "The Sphinx".

Aeschylus continued his emphasis on the polis with "The Suppliants" in 463 BC ("Hiketides"), which pays tribute to the democratic undercurrents running through Athens in advance of the establishment of a democratic government in 461. In the play, the <a href="Danaids">Danaids</a>, the fifty daughters of <a href="Danaus">Danaus</a>, founder of <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. They turn to King <a href="Pelasgus">Pelasgus</a> of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move on the part of the king. The people decide that the Danaids deserve protection, and they are allowed within the walls of Argos despite Egyptian protests.

The 1952 publication of Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 2256 fr. 3 confirmed a long-assumed (because of "The Suppliants"' cliffhanger ending) Danaid trilogy, whose constituent plays are generally agreed to be "The Suppliants", "The Egyptians" and "The Danaids". A plausible reconstruction of the trilogy's last two-thirds runs thus: In "The Egyptians", the Argive-Egyptian war threatened in the first play has transpired. During the course of the war, King Pelasgus has been killed, and Danaus rules Argos. He negotiates a peace settlement with Aegyptus, as a condition of which, his fifty daughters will marry the fifty sons of Aegyptus. Danaus secretly informs his daughters of an oracle predicting that one of his sons-in-law would kill him; he therefore orders the Danaids to murder their husbands on their wedding night. His daughters agree. "The Danaids" would open the day after the wedding.

In short order, it is revealed that forty-nine of the Danaids killed their husbands as ordered; Hypermnestra, however, loved her husband Lynceus, and thus spared his life and helped him to escape. Angered by his daughter's disobedience, Danaus orders her imprisonment and, possibly, her execution. In the trilogy's climax and dénouement, Lynceus reveals himself to Danaus, and kills him (thus fulfilling the oracle). He and Hypermnestra will establish a ruling dynasty in Argos. The other forty-nine Danaids are absolved of their murderous crime, and married off to unspecified Argive men. The satyr play following this trilogy was titled "Amymone", after one of the Danaids.

The only complete (save a few missing lines in several spots) <a href="trilogy">trilogy</a> of Greek plays by any playwright still extant is the "<a href="Oresteia">Oresteia</a>" (458 BC); although the satyr play that originally followed it, "<a href="Proteus">Proteus</a>", is lost except for some fragments. The trilogy consists of "<a href="The%20Oresteia%23Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>", "<a href="The%20Oresteia%23The%20Libation%20Bearers">The Libation Bearers</a>" ("Choephoroi"), and "<a href="The%20Oresteia%23The%20Eumenides">The Eumenides</a>". Together, these plays tell the bloody story of the family of <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, King of <a href="Argos">Argos</a>.

Aeschylus begins in Greece describing the return of King <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> from his victory in the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>, from the perspective of the towns people (the Chorus) and his wife, <a href="Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</a>. However, dark foreshadowings build to the death of the king at the hands of his wife, who was angry at his sacrifice of their daughter <a href="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a>, who was killed so that the gods would restore the winds and allow the Greek fleet to sail to Troy. She was also unhappy at his keeping of the Trojan prophetess <a href="Cassandra">Cassandra</a> as a concubine. Cassandra foretells of the murder of Agamemnon, and of herself, to the assembled townsfolk, who are horrified. She then enters the palace knowing that she cannot avoid her fate. The ending of the play includes a prediction of the return of <a href="Orestes%20%28mythology%29">Orestes</a>, son of Agamemnon, who will seek to avenge his father."

"The Libation Bearers" continues the tale, opening with Orestes's arrival at Agamemnon's tomb. At the tomb, Electra meets <a href="Orestes">Orestes</a>, who has returned from exile in <a href="Phocis">Phocis</a>, and they plan revenge upon Clytemnestra and her lover <a href="Aegisthus">Aegisthus</a>. Clytemnestra's account of a nightmare in which she gives birth to a snake is recounted by the chorus; and this leads her to order <a href="Electra">Electra</a>, her daughter, to pour libations on Agamemnon's tomb (with the assistance of libation bearers) in hope of making amends. Orestes enters the palace pretending to bear news of his own death, and when Clytemnestra calls in Aegisthus to share in the news, Orestes kills them both. Orestes is then beset by the <a href="Erinyes">Furies</a>, who avenge the murders of kin in Greek mythology.

The final play of "The Oresteia" addresses the question of Orestes' guilt. The Furies drive Orestes from Argos and into the wilderness. He makes his way to the temple of Apollo and begs him to drive the Furies away. Apollo had encouraged Orestes to kill Clytemnestra, and so bears some of the guilt for the murder. The Furies are a more ancient race of the gods, and Apollo sends Orestes to the temple of Athena, with Hermes as a guide.

The Furies track him down, and the goddess <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, patron of Athens, steps in and declares that a trial is necessary. Apollo argues Orestes' case and, after the judges, including Athena deliver a tie vote, Athena announces that Orestes is acquitted. She renames the Furies "The Eumenides" (The Good-spirited, or Kindly Ones), and extols the importance of reason in the development of laws, and, as in "The Suppliants", the ideals of a democratic Athens are praised.

In addition to these six works, a seventh tragedy, "Prometheus Bound", is attributed to Aeschylus by ancient authorities. Since the late 19th century, however, scholars have increasingly doubted this ascription, largely on stylistic grounds. Its production date is also in dispute, with theories ranging from the 480s BC to as late as the 410s.

The play consists mostly of static dialogue, as throughout the play the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a> is bound to a rock as punishment from the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian</a> <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> for providing fire to humans. The god <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>, the Titan <a href="Oceanus">Oceanus</a>, and the <a href="greek%20chorus">chorus</a> of <a href="Oceanids">Oceanids</a> all express sympathy for Prometheus' plight. Prometheus meets <a href="Io%20%28mythology%29">Io</a>, a fellow victim of Zeus' cruelty; and prophesies her future travels, revealing that one of her descendants will free Prometheus. The play closes with Zeus sending Prometheus into the abyss because Prometheus refuses to divulge the secret of a potential marriage that could prove Zeus' downfall.

The "Prometheus Bound" appears to have been the first play in a trilogy called the "<a href="Prometheia">Prometheia</a>". In the second play, "<a href="Prometheus%20Unbound%20%28Aeschylus%29">Prometheus Unbound</a>", Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat Prometheus' perpetually regenerating liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, we learn that Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned at the conclusion of the <a href="Titanomachy">Titanomachy</a>.

In the trilogy's conclusion, "<a href="Prometheus%20the%20Fire-Bringer">Prometheus the Fire-Bringer</a>", it appears that the Titan finally warns Zeus not to sleep with the sea nymph <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a>, for she is fated to give birth to a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus marries Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union is Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. After reconciling with Prometheus, Zeus probably inaugurates a festival in his honor at Athens.

Only the titles and assorted fragments of Aeschylus's other plays have come down to us. We have enough fragments of some plays (along with comments made by later authors and scholiasts) to produce rough synopses of their plots.

This play was based on books 9 and 16 in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". Achilles sits in silent indignation over his humiliation at Agamemnon's hands for most of the play. Envoys from the Greek army attempt to reconcile him to <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, but he yields only to his friend <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, who then battles the Trojans in Achilles' armour. The bravery and death of Patroclus are reported in a messenger's speech, which is followed by mourning.

This play was based on books 18, 19, and 22 of the "Iliad"; it follows the Daughters of Nereus, the sea god, who lament Patroclus' death. In the play, a messenger tells how Achilles, perhaps reconciled to Agamemnon and the Greeks, slew <a href="Hector">Hector</a>.

In this play, Achilles sits in silent mourning over Patroclus, after a brief discussion with <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>. Hermes then brings in <a href="Priam">King Priam of Troy</a>, who wins over Achilles and ransoms his son's body in a spectacular <a href="wikt%3Acoup%20de%20th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre">coup de théâtre</a>. A scale is brought on stage and Hector's body is placed in one scale and gold in the other. The dynamic dancing of the chorus of Trojans when they enter with Priam is reported by <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>.

The children of <a href="Niobe">Niobe</a>, the heroine, have been slain by <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> because Niobe had gloated that she had more children than their mother, <a href="Leto">Leto</a>. Niobe sits in silent mourning on stage during most of the play. In the "<a href="Republic%20%28Plato%29">Republic</a>", <a href="Plato">Plato</a> quotes the line "God plants a fault in mortals when he wills to destroy a house utterly."

These are the remaining 71 plays ascribed to Aeschylus which are known to us:

When Aeschylus first began writing, the theatre had only just begun to evolve, although earlier playwrights like <a href="Thespis">Thespis</a> had already expanded the cast to include an actor who was able to interact with the <a href="Greek%20chorus">chorus</a>. Aeschylus added a second actor, allowing for greater dramatic variety, while the chorus played a less important role. He is sometimes credited with introducing "skenographia", or scene-decoration, though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles. Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and having his actors wear platform boots ("cothurni") to make them more visible to the audience. According to a later account of Aeschylus's life, as they walked on stage in the first performance of the "Eumenides", the chorus of Furies were so frightening in appearance that they caused young children to faint, patriarchs to urinate, and pregnant women to go into labour.

His plays were written in verse, no violence is performed on stage, and the plays have a remoteness from daily life in Athens, either by relating stories about the gods or by being set, like "The Persians", in far-away locales. Aeschylus's work has a strong moral and religious emphasis. The "Oresteia" trilogy concentrated on man's position in the cosmos in relation to the gods, divine law, and divine punishment.

Aeschylus's popularity is evident in the praise the comic playwright <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> gives him in "<a href="The%20Frogs">The Frogs</a>", produced some half-century after Aeschylus's death. Appearing as a character in the play, Aeschylus claims at line 1022 that his "Seven against Thebes" "made everyone watching it to love being warlike"; with his "Persians", Aeschylus claims at lines 1026–7 that he "taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies." Aeschylus goes on to say at lines 1039ff. that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous.

Aeschylus's works were influential beyond his own time. <a href="Hugh%20Lloyd-Jones">Hugh Lloyd-Jones</a> draws attention to <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>'s reverence of Aeschylus. Michael Ewans argues in his "Wagner and Aeschylus. The Ring and the Oresteia" (London: Faber. 1982) that the influence was so great as to merit a direct character by character comparison between Wagner's "Ring" and Aeschylus's "Oresteia". A critic of his book however, while not denying that Wagner read and respected Aeschylus, has described his arguments as unreasonable and forced.

Sir <a href="J.%20T.%20Sheppard">J. T. Sheppard</a> argues in the second half of his "Aeschylus and Sophocles: Their Work and Influence" that Aeschylus, along with <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>, have played a major part in the formation of dramatic literature from the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> to the present, specifically in French and Elizabethan drama. He also claims that their influence went beyond just drama and applies to literature in general, citing Milton and the Romantics.

During his presidential campaign in 1968, Senator <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> quoted the <a href="Edith%20Hamilton">Edith Hamilton</a> translation of Aeschylus on the night of the assassination of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> Kennedy was notified of King's murder before a campaign stop in <a href="Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana">Indianapolis, Indiana</a> and was warned not to attend the event due to fears of <a href="riot">riot</a>ing from the mostly <a href="African-American">African-American</a> crowd. Kennedy insisted on attending and delivered an <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%27s%20speech%20on%20the%20assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">impromptu speech</a> that delivered news of King's death to the crowd.

Acknowledging the audience's emotions, Kennedy referred to his own grief at the murder of his brother, President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and, quoting a passage from the play "Agamemnon" (in translation), said: "My favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote: 'Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.' What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness; but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black ... Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world." The quotation from Aeschylus was later inscribed on a memorial at the gravesite of Robert Kennedy following his own assassination.

Amber Road

The Amber Road was an ancient <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a> for the transfer of <a href="amber">amber</a> from coastal areas of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. Prehistoric <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a>s between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade. As an important commodity, sometimes dubbed "the gold of the north", amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the <a href="Vistula">Vistula</a> and <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper</a> rivers to <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> over a period of thousands of years.

From at least the sixteenth century BC, amber was moved from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean area. The breast ornament of the Egyptian pharaoh <a href="Tutankhamen">Tutankhamen</a> (ca. 1333–1324 BC) contains large Baltic amber beads <a href="Heinrich%20Schliemann">Heinrich Schliemann</a> found Baltic amber beads at <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a>, as shown by spectroscopic investigation. The quantity of amber in the Royal Tomb of Qatna, Syria, is unparalleled for known second millennium BC sites in the Levant and the Ancient Near East. Amber was sent from the North Sea to the temple of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> at <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> as an offering. From the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, trade could continue to Asia along the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>, another ancient trade route. In <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> times, a main route ran south from the Baltic coast through the land of the <a href="Boii">Boii</a> (modern <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> and <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>) to the head of the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> (modern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Venice">Gulf of Venice</a>).

The <a href="Old%20Prussians">Old Prussian</a> towns of <a href="Mokhovoye">Kaup</a> and <a href="Truso">Truso</a> on the Baltic were the starting points of the route to the south. In <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> the amber road probably gave rise to the thriving <a href="Nordic%20Bronze%20Age">Nordic Bronze Age</a> culture, bringing influences from the Mediterranean Sea to the northernmost countries of Europe.

Sometimes the <a href="Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a> is called the Янтарный край, which means "the amber area".


Amber roads connect <a href="amber%20finding%20locations">amber finding locations</a> to customer sites in Europe, in the Middle East regions and in the Far East.

The shortest (and possibly oldest) road avoids <a href="Alpine%20climate">alpine</a> areas and led from the Baltic coastline (nowadays <a href="Palanga%20Amber%20Museum">Lithuania</a> and <a href="Poland">Poland</a>), through <a href="Biskupin">Biskupin</a> and what is now <a href="Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a>, passed the <a href="Moravian%20Gate">Moravian Gate</a>, followed the river <a href="Morava%20River%20%28Central%20Europe%29">Morava</a>, crossed the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> near <a href="Carnuntum">Carnuntum</a> in the <a href="Noricum%20Province">Noricum Province</a>, headed southwest past <a href="Poetovio">Poetovio</a>, <a href="Celeia">Celeia</a>, <a href="Emona">Emona</a>, <a href="Nauportus">Nauportus</a>, and reached <a href="Padua">Patavium</a> and <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a> at the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> coast. One of the oldest directions of the last stage of the Amber Road to the south of the Danube, noted in the myth about the <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a>, used the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> and <a href="Kupa%20%28river%29">Kupa</a> rivers, ending with a short continental road from Nauportus to "Tarsatica" (Trsat, <a href="Rijeka">Rijeka</a>) on the coast of the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a>.

Several roads connected the North Sea and Baltic Sea, especially the city of <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> to the <a href="Brenner%20Pass">Brenner Pass</a>, proceeding southwards to <a href="Brindisi">Brindisi</a> (nowadays Italy) and Ambracia (nowadays Greece).

The <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> region indicates a number of alpine roads, concentrating around the capital city <a href="Bern">Bern</a> and probably originating from the borders of the <a href="Rh%C3%B4ne%20River">Rhône River</a> and the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>.

A small section, including <a href="Baarn">Baarn</a>, <a href="Barneveld%20%28town%29">Barneveld</a>, <a href="Amersfoort">Amersfoort</a> and <a href="Amerongen">Amerongen</a>, connected the North Sea with the Lower Rhine.

A small section led southwards from <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> to the towns Braine-l’Alleud and Braine-le-Comte, both originally named "Brennia-Brenna". The route continued by following the <a href="Meuse%20River">Meuse River</a> towards <a href="Bern">Bern</a> in Switzerland.

Three routes may be identified leading from an amber finding region or delta at the mouth of the River Openia towards Bresse and Bern, crossing the Alps to Switzerland and Italy.

Routes connecting amber finding locations at Ambares (near <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>), leading to <a href="B%C3%A9arn">Béarn</a> and the Pyrenees. Routes connecting the amber finding locations in northern Spain and in the Pyrenees were a trading route to the Mediterranean Sea.

There is a tourist route stretching along the Baltic coast from <a href="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a> to <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> called "Amber Road".

"Amber Road" objects are:

Crandall University

Crandall University is a small Christian <a href="Liberal%20Arts">Liberal Arts</a> university located in <a href="Moncton">Moncton, New Brunswick</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. Crandall is operated by the <a href="Convention%20of%20Atlantic%20Baptist%20Churches">Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches</a>.

Crandall University 106736150RR0001 was registered as a charitable organization in Canada on January 1, 1967. The primary areas in which the charity is now carrying on programs to achieve its charitable purposes, ranked according to the percentage of time and resources devoted to each program area follow:
The charity carried on charitable programs to further its charitable purpose(s) (as defined in its governing documents) this fiscal period:

Crandall University houses the Baptist Heritage Center whose 300 artifacts preserve the material history of Atlantic Baptists, the Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches, and its predecessor organizations. The collection and archives includes objects used in worship services, furniture, musical instruments, church building architecture pictures and printed material.

The school was founded in 1949 under the name United Baptist Bible Training School (UBBTS), and served as both a <a href="secondary%20school">secondary school</a> and a Bible school. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to Atlantic Baptist College (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degrees in 1983. Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of <a href="Moncton">Moncton</a>'s central business district.

The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was also changed to Atlantic Baptist University, a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation. In 2003, the ABU sports teams adopted the name "The Blue Tide". The institution was the first, and thus far only, <a href="English%20language">English</a> university in Moncton. The "Atlantic Baptist University Act" was passed by the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20New%20Brunswick">Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick</a> in 2008.

On August 21, 2009 it was announced that the institution had changed its name to Crandall University in honour of Rev. <a href="Joseph%20Crandall">Joseph Crandall</a>, a pioneering Baptist minister in the maritime region. In conjunction with the University name change, Crandall Athletics took on a new identity as "The Crandall Chargers."

In 2012, Crandall University came under public scrutiny for receiving municipal funds regardless of having an anti-gay hiring policy.


The University has been criticized for accepting public money (municipal, provincial and federal) to fund programs and expansions to the campus but maintaining a hiring policy which would prohibit gay faculty. A year after the controversy erupted, the University opted to not apply for $150,000 in public funding that it had received annually in order to avoid changing its hiring policy.

Andrew Wiles

Sir Andrew John Wiles (born 11 April 1953) is a British mathematician and a <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> Research Professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, specialising in <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>. He is best known for <a href="Wiles%27s%20proof%20of%20Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">proving</a> <a href="Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a>, for which he received the 2016 <a href="Abel%20Prize">Abel Prize</a>. Wiles has received numerous other honours, including the <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>'s highest honour, in 2017. 

Wiles was born in 1953 in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20England">Cambridge</a>, England, the son of <a href="Maurice%20Wiles">Maurice Frank Wiles</a> (1923–2005), the <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Divinity%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Oxford">Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford</a>, and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll). His father worked as the Chaplain at <a href="Ridley%20Hall%2C%20Cambridge">Ridley Hall, Cambridge</a>, for the years 1952–55. Wiles attended King's College School, Cambridge, and <a href="The%20Leys%20School%2C%20Cambridge">The Leys School, Cambridge</a>.

Wiles states that he came across Fermat's Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped by his local library where he found a book about the theorem. Fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he, a ten-year-old, could understand it, but that no one had proven, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited, so he abandoned his childhood dream, until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by <a href="Ken%20Ribet">Ken Ribet</a>'s 1986 proof of the <a href="epsilon%20conjecture">epsilon conjecture</a>, which <a href="Gerhard%20Frey">Gerhard Frey</a> had previously linked to Fermat's famous equation.

Wiles earned his <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a> in mathematics in 1974 at <a href="Merton%20College%2C%20Oxford">Merton College, Oxford</a>, and a PhD in 1980 at <a href="Clare%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Clare College, Cambridge</a>. After a stay at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> in 1981, Wiles became a professor at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>. In 1985–86, Wiles was a <a href="Guggenheim%20Fellow">Guggenheim Fellow</a> at the <a href="Institut%20des%20Hautes%20%C3%89tudes%20Scientifiques">Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques</a> near Paris and at the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Normale%20Sup%C3%A9rieure">École Normale Supérieure</a>. From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> Research Professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, and then he returned to Princeton. He rejoined Oxford in 2011 as Royal Society Research Professor.

Wiles's graduate research was guided by <a href="John%20Coates%20%28mathematician%29">John Coates</a> beginning in the summer of 1975. Together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of <a href="elliptic%20curve">elliptic curve</a>s with <a href="complex%20multiplication">complex multiplication</a> by the methods of <a href="Iwasawa%20theory">Iwasawa theory</a>. He further worked with <a href="Barry%20Mazur">Barry Mazur</a> on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s, and soon afterward, he generalised this result to <a href="totally%20real%20field">totally real field</a>s.

Starting in mid-1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of <a href="Gerhard%20Frey">Gerhard Frey</a>, <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a> and <a href="Ken%20Ribet">Ken Ribet</a>, it became clear that <a href="Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> could be proven as a corollary of a limited form of the <a href="modularity%20theorem">modularity theorem</a> (unproven at the time and then known as the "Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture"). The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles's own specialist area.

The conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove. For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor <a href="John%20H.%20Coates">John Coates</a> states that it seemed "impossible to actually prove", and Ken Ribet considered himself "one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible", adding that "Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it]."

Despite this, Wiles, with his from-childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture, at least to the extent needed for <a href="Frey%27s%20elliptic%20curve">Frey's curve</a>. He dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.

In June 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge.
In August 1993, it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in one area. Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing, rather than closing this area, came to him on 19 September 1994, when he was on the verge of giving up. Together with his former student <a href="Richard%20Taylor%20%28mathematician%29">Richard Taylor</a>, he published a second paper which circumvented the problem and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in May 1995 in a dedicated volume of the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Mathematics">Annals of Mathematics</a>".

Anne Brontë

Anne Brontë (, "commonly" ; 17 January 1820 – 28 May 1849) was an English novelist and poet, the youngest member of the <a href="Bront%C3%AB%20family">Brontë</a> literary family.

The daughter of <a href="Patrick%20Bront%C3%AB">Patrick Brontë</a>, a poor Irish clergyman in the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, Anne Brontë lived most of her life with her family at the parish of <a href="Haworth">Haworth</a> on the Yorkshire moors. She also attended a boarding school in <a href="Mirfield">Mirfield</a> between 1836 and 1837. At 19 she left Haworth and worked as a governess between 1839 and 1845. After leaving her teaching position, she fulfilled her literary ambitions. She published a volume of poetry with her sisters ("<a href="Poems%20by%20Currer%2C%20Ellis%2C%20and%20Acton%20Bell">Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell</a>", 1846) and two novels. "<a href="Agnes%20Grey">Agnes Grey</a>", based upon her experiences as a governess, was published in 1847. Her second and last novel, "<a href="The%20Tenant%20of%20Wildfell%20Hall">The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</a>", which is considered to be one of the first sustained <a href="Feminism">feminist</a> novels, appeared in 1848. Like her poems, both her novels were first published under the masculine pen name of Acton Bell. Anne's life was cut short when she died of what is now suspected to be <a href="pulmonary%20tuberculosis">pulmonary tuberculosis</a> at the age of 29.

Partly because the re-publication of "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall" was prevented by <a href="Charlotte%20Bront%C3%AB">Charlotte Brontë</a> after Anne's death, she is not as well known as her sisters. However, her novels, like those of her sisters, have become classics of <a href="English%20literature">English literature</a>.

Anne's father, <a href="Patrick%20Bront%C3%AB">Patrick Brontë</a> (1777–1861), was born in a two-room cottage in Emdale, <a href="Loughbrickland">Loughbrickland</a>, <a href="County%20Down">County Down</a>, Ireland. He was the oldest of ten children born to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, poor Irish peasant farmers. The family surname "mac Aedh Ó Proinntigh" was <a href="Anglicisation">Anglicised</a> as Prunty or Brunty. Struggling against poverty, Patrick learned to read and write and from 1798 taught others. In 1802, at 25, he won a place to study theology at <a href="St.%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St. John's College, Cambridge</a> where he changed his name, Brunty, to the more distinguished sounding Brontë. In 1807 he was ordained in the priesthood in the Church of England. He served as a <a href="curate">curate</a> first in Essex and latterly in Wellington, Shropshire. In 1810, he published his first poem "Winter Evening Thoughts" in a local newspaper, followed in 1811 by a collection of moral verse, "Cottage Poems". In 1811, he became vicar of St. Peter's Church in <a href="Hartshead">Hartshead</a> in Yorkshire. The following year he was appointed an examiner in Classics at <a href="Woodhouse%20Grove%20School">Woodhouse Grove School</a>, near <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a> a <a href="John%20Wesley">Wesleyan</a> academy where, aged 35, he met his future wife, <a href="Maria%20Branwell">Maria Branwell</a>, the headmaster's niece.

Anne's mother, Maria Branwell (1783–1821), was the daughter of Thomas Branwell, a successful, property-owning grocer and tea merchant in <a href="Penzance">Penzance</a> and Anne Carne, the daughter of a silversmith. The eleventh of twelve children, Maria enjoyed the benefits of belonging to a prosperous family in a small town. After the death of her parents within a year of each other, Maria went to help her aunt administer the housekeeping functions of the school. A tiny, neat woman aged 30, she was well read and intelligent. Her strong <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> faith attracted Patrick Brontë because his own leanings were similar.

Though from considerably different backgrounds, within three months Patrick Brontë and Maria Branwell were married on 29 December 1812. Their first child, Maria (1814–1825), was born after they moved to <a href="Hartshead">Hartshead</a>. In 1815, Patrick was appointed curate of the chapel in <a href="Thornton%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Thornton</a>, near <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>; a second daughter, Elizabeth (1815–1825), was born shortly after. Four more children followed: <a href="Charlotte%20Bront%C3%AB">Charlotte</a>, (1816–1855), <a href="Branwell%20Bront%C3%AB">Patrick Branwell</a> (1817–1848), <a href="Emily%20Bront%C3%AB">Emily</a>, (1818–1848) and Anne (1820–1849).

Anne, the youngest of the Brontë children, was born on 17 January 1820, at 74 Market Street in Thornton on the outskirts of <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a> where her father was curate and she was baptised there on 25 March 1820. Anne's father was appointed to the perpetual curacy in Haworth, a small town away. In April 1820, the Brontës moved into the five-roomed Haworth Parsonage which became their home for the rest of their lives.

Anne was barely a year old when her mother became ill of what is believed to have been <a href="uterine%20cancer">uterine cancer</a>. Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821. In order to provide a mother for his children, Patrick tried to remarry, but without success. Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), moved to the parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister, but she spent the rest of her life there raising the children. She did it from a sense of duty, but she was a stern woman who expected respect, rather than love. There was little affection between her and the older children, but Anne, according to tradition, was her favourite.

In <a href="Elizabeth%20Gaskell">Elizabeth Gaskell</a>'s biography, Anne's father remembered her as precocious, reporting that once, when she was four years old, in reply to his question about what a child most wanted, she answered: "age and experience".

In summer 1824, Patrick sent Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Emily to Crofton Hall in <a href="Crofton%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Crofton, West Yorkshire</a>, and subsequently to the Clergy Daughter's School at <a href="Cowan%20Bridge">Cowan Bridge</a> in Lancashire. When his eldest daughters died of consumption in 1825, Maria on 6 May and Elizabeth on 15 June, Charlotte and Emily were immediately brought home. The unexpected deaths distressed the family so much that Patrick could not face sending them away again. For the next five years, they were educated at home, largely by their father and aunt. The children made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage, but relied on each other for friendship and companionship. The bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground. Anne shared a room with her aunt, they were close which may have influenced Anne's personality and religious beliefs.

Anne's studies at home included music and drawing. Anne, Emily and Branwell had piano lessons from the Keighley church organist. They had art lessons from John Bradley of Keighley and all drew with some skill. Their aunt tried to teach the girls how to run a household, but their minds were more inclined to literature. Their father's well-stocked library was a source of knowledge. They read the Bible, <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, <a href="John%20Milton">Milton</a>, <a href="Byron">Byron</a>, <a href="Walter%20Scott">Scott</a>, and many others, they examined articles from <a href="Blackwood%27s%20Edinburgh%20Magazine">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</a>, <a href="Fraser%27s%20Magazine">Fraser's Magazine</a>, and The Edinburgh Review and read history, geography and biographies.

Reading fed the children's imagination. Their creativity soared after their father presented Branwell with a set of toy soldiers in June 1826. They gave the soldiers names and developed their characters, which they called the "Twelves". This led to the creation of an imaginary world: the African kingdom of "<a href="Angria%20%28fictional%20country%29">Angria</a>" which was illustrated with maps and watercolour renderings. The children devised plots about the inhabitants of Angria and its capital city, "Glass Town", later called Verreopolis or Verdopolis.

The fantasy worlds and kingdoms gradually acquired the characteristics of real world—sovereigns, armies, heroes, outlaws, fugitives, inns, schools and publishers. The characters and lands created by the children had newspapers, magazines and chronicles which were written in extremely tiny books, with writing so small it was difficult to read without a magnifying glass. These creations and writings were an apprenticeship for their later, literary talents.

Around 1831, when Anne was eleven, she and Emily broke away from Charlotte and Branwell to create and develop their own fantasy world, "<a href="Gondal%20%28fictional%20country%29">Gondal</a>". Anne was particularly close to Emily especially after Charlotte's departure for Roe Head School, in January 1831. When Charlotte's friend <a href="Ellen%20Nussey">Ellen Nussey</a> visited Haworth in 1833, she reported that Emily and Anne were "like twins", "inseparable companions". She described Anne:
"Anne, dear gentle Anne was quite different in appearance from the others, and she was her aunt's favourite. Her hair was a very pretty light brown, and fell on her neck in graceful curls. She had lovely violet-blue eyes; fine pencilled eyebrows and a clear almost transparent complexion. She still pursued her studies and especially her sewing, under the surveillance of her aunt."
Anne took lessons from Charlotte, after she returned from Roe Head. Charlotte returned to Roe Head as a teacher on 29 July 1835 accompanied by Emily as a pupil; her tuition largely financed by Charlotte's teaching. Within a few months, Emily unable to adapt to life at school, was physically ill from homesickness. She was withdrawn from school by October, and replaced by Anne.

Aged 15, it was Anne's first time away from home, and she made few friends at Roe Head. She was quiet and hard working, and determined to stay and get the education she needed to support herself. She stayed for two years, winning a good-conduct medal in December 1836, and returning home only during Christmas and summer holidays. Anne and Charlotte do not appear to have been close while at Roe Head (Charlotte's letters almost never mention her) but Charlotte was concerned about her sister's health. Sometime before December 1837, Anne became seriously ill with <a href="gastritis">gastritis</a> and underwent a religious crisis. A <a href="Moravian%20Church">Moravian</a> minister was called to see her several times during her illness, suggesting her distress was caused, in part, by conflict with the local Anglican clergy. Charlotte wrote to her father who took Anne home where she remained while she recovered.

In 1839, a year after leaving the school and aged 19, she was seeking a teaching position. As the daughter of a poor clergyman, she needed to earn a living. Her father had no private income and the parsonage would revert to the church on his death. Teaching or working as governess for a family were among the few options available to poor but educated women. In April 1839, Anne started work as a governess for the Ingham family at Blake Hall, near <a href="Mirfield">Mirfield</a>.

The children in her charge were spoilt and often disobedient. She had great difficulty controlling them and had little success in instilling any education. She was not empowered to inflict punishment, and when she complained about their behaviour received no support, but was criticised for not being capable. The Inghams, dissatisfied with their children's progress, dismissed Anne. She returned home at Christmas, 1839, joining Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. The episode at Blake Hall was so traumatic that she reproduced it in almost perfect detail in her novel, "Agnes Grey".

On her return to Haworth, she met William Weightman (1814–1842), her father's new curate, who started work in the parish in August 1839. Aged 25, he had obtained a two-year licentiate in theology from the <a href="University%20of%20Durham">University of Durham</a>. He was welcome at the parsonage. Her acquaintance with him parallels her writing a number of poems, which may suggest she fell in love with him although there is disagreement over this possibility. Little evidence exists beyond a teasing anecdote of Charlotte's to Ellen Nussey in January 1842.

The source of "Agnes Grey"'s renewed interest in poetry is, however, the curate to whom she is attracted. William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It seems clear he was a good-looking, engaging young man, whose easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made a considerable impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.

If Anne formed an attachment to Weightman it does not imply that he was attracted to her. It is possible that Weightman was no more aware of her, her sisters or their friend Ellen Nussey. Nor does it imply that Anne believed him to be interested in her. If anything, her poems suggest the opposite–they speak of quietly experienced but intensely felt emotions, hidden from others, without any indication of being requited. It is possible that an initially mild attraction to Weightman assumed increasing importance to Anne over time, in the absence of other opportunities for love, marriage and children.

Anne would have seen Weightman on her holidays at home, particularly during the summer of 1842 when her sisters were away. Weightman died of cholera in the same year. Anne expressed her grief for his death in her poem "I will not mourn thee, lovely one", in which she called him "our darling".

Anne obtained a second post as governess to the children of the Reverend Edmund Robinson and his wife Lydia, at Thorp Green Hall, a comfortable country house near <a href="York">York</a>. Anne was employed at Thorp Green Hall from 1840 to 1845. The house appeared as Horton Lodge in her novel "Agnes Grey". Anne had four pupils: Lydia, aged 15, Elizabeth, aged 13, Mary, aged 12, and Edmund, aged 8. Initially, she encountered similar problems as she had experienced at Blake Hall. Anne missed her home and family, commenting in a diary paper in 1841 that she did not like her situation and wished to leave it. Her quiet, gentle disposition did not help. However, despite her outwardly placid appearance, Anne was determined and with experience, made a success of her position, becoming well liked by her employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, became lifelong friends.

For the next five years, Anne spent no more than five or six weeks a year with her family, during holidays at Christmas and in June. The rest of her time was spent with the Robinsons at Thorp Green. She was obliged to accompany them on annual holidays to <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a>. Between 1840 and 1844, Anne spent around five weeks each summer at the coastal town and loved the place. A number of locations in Scarborough were the setting for "Agnes Grey"'s final scenes and for Linden-Car village in "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall".

Whilst working for the Robinsons, Anne and her sisters considered the possibility of setting up a school. Various locations including the parsonage were considered. The project never materialised and Anne chose to return to Thorp Green. She came home on the death of her aunt in early November 1842 while her sisters were in Brussels. Elizabeth Branwell left a £350 legacy (equivalent to £ in ) for each of her nieces.

It was at the Long Plantation at Thorp Green in 1842 that Anne wrote her three-verse poem "Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day", which was published in 1846 under her pen-name of Acton Bell.

Anne returned to Thorp Green in January 1843 where she secured a position for Branwell. He was to take over as tutor to the Robinsons' son, Edmund, who was growing too old to be in Anne's care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did. Anne's vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing deeply felt emotions with careful thought, a sense of responsibility and resolute determination. All three Brontë sisters worked as governesses or teachers, and all experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness—but Anne was the only one who persevered and made a success of her work.

Anne and Branwell taught at Thorp Green for the next three years. Branwell entered into a secret relationship with his employer's wife, Lydia Robinson. When Anne and her brother returned home for the holidays in June 1846, she resigned her position. While Anne gave no reason for leaving Thorp Green, it is thought she wanted to leave on becoming aware of the relationship between her brother and Mrs Robinson. Branwell was dismissed when his employer found out about the relationship. Anne retained close ties to Elizabeth and Mary Robinson, exchanging letters even after Branwell's disgrace. The Robinson sisters came to visit Anne in December 1848.

Anne took Emily to visit some of the places she had come to know and love in the five years spent with the Robinsons. A plan to visit <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> fell through and instead the sisters went to <a href="York">York</a> where Anne showed her sister <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a>.

During the summer of 1845, the Brontës were at home with their father. None had any immediate prospect of employment. Charlotte came across Emily's poems which had been shared only with Anne, her partner in the world of Gondal. Charlotte proposed that they be published. Anne revealed her own poems but Charlotte's reaction was characteristically patronising: "I thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own". Eventually the sisters reached an agreement. They told neither Branwell, nor their father, nor their friends about what they were doing. Anne and Emily each contributed 21 poems and Charlotte contributed 19 and with Aunt Branwell's money, they paid to have the collection published.

Afraid their work would be judged differently if they revealed they were women, the book appeared using male <a href="pen%20name">pen name</a>s, the initials of which were the same as their own. Charlotte, Emily, and Anne respectively became Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. "<a href="Poems%20by%20Currer%2C%20Ellis%2C%20and%20Acton%20Bell">Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell</a>" was available for sale in May 1846. The cost of publication was about three-quarters of Anne's salary at Thorp Green. On 7 May 1846, the first three copies were delivered to Haworth Parsonage. It achieved three somewhat favourable reviews, but was a dismal failure, with only two copies being sold in the first year. Anne, however, found a market for her more recent poetry. The "Leeds Intelligencer" and "Fraser's Magazine" published her poem "The Narrow Way" under her pseudonym, Acton Bell in December 1848. Four months earlier, in August, Fraser's Magazine had published her poem "The Three Guides".

Even before the fate of the book of poems became apparent, the sisters began work on their <a href="first%20novel">first novel</a>s. Charlotte wrote "<a href="The%20Professor%20%28novel%29">The Professor</a>", Emily "<a href="Wuthering%20Heights">Wuthering Heights</a>", and Anne "Agnes Grey". By July 1846, a package with the three manuscripts was making the rounds of London publishers.

After a number of rejections, Emily's "Wuthering Heights" and Anne's "Agnes Grey" were accepted by the publisher <a href="Thomas%20Cautley%20Newby">Thomas Cautley Newby</a>, but Charlotte's novel was rejected by every publisher to whom it was sent. Charlotte was not long in completing her second novel, "<a href="Jane%20Eyre">Jane Eyre</a>"; it was immediately accepted by <a href="Smith%2C%20Elder%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Smith, Elder & Co.</a> and was the first to appear in print. While Anne and Emily's novels 'lingered in the press', Charlotte's second novel was an immediate and resounding success. Anne and Emily were obliged to pay fifty pounds to help meet their publishing costs. Their publisher, urged on by the success of "Jane Eyre", published Anne and Emily's novels in December 1847. They sold well, but "Agnes Grey" was outshone by Emily's more dramatic "Wuthering Heights".

Anne's second novel, "<a href="The%20Tenant%20of%20Wildfell%20Hall">The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</a>", was published in the last week of June 1848. It was an instant, phenomenal success; within six weeks it was sold out.

"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall" is perhaps amongst the most shocking of contemporary Victorian novels. In seeking to present the truth in literature, Anne's depiction of alcoholism and debauchery was profoundly disturbing to 19th-century sensibilities. Helen Graham, the tenant of the title, intrigues Gilbert Markham and gradually she reveals her past as an artist and wife of the dissipated Arthur Huntingdon. The book's brilliance lies in its revelation of the position of women at the time, and its multi-layered plot.

It is easy today to underestimate the extent to which the novel challenged existing social and legal structures. <a href="May%20Sinclair">May Sinclair</a>, in 1913, said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England. Anne's heroine eventually left her husband to protect their young son from his influence. She supported herself and her son by painting while living in hiding, fearful of discovery. In doing so, she violated not only social conventions, but English law. Until 1870, when the <a href="Married%20Women%27s%20Property%20Act%201870">Married Women's Property Act</a> was passed, a married woman had no independent legal existence apart from her husband; could not own property, sue for divorce, or control custody of her children. If she attempted to live apart, her husband had the right to reclaim her. If she took their child, she was liable for kidnapping. By living on her own income she was held to be stealing her husband's property, since any property she held or income she made was legally his.

In the second edition of "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall", which appeared in August 1848, Anne clearly stated her intentions in writing it. She presented a forceful rebuttal to critics (Charlotte was among them) who considered her portrayal of Huntingdon overly graphic and disturbing.

Anne sharply castigated reviewers who speculated on the sex of the authors, and the appropriateness of their writing, in words that do little to reinforce the stereotype of Anne as meek and gentle.

In July 1848, to dispel the rumour that the "Bell brothers" were all the same person, Charlotte and Anne went to London to reveal their identities to Charlotte's publisher <a href="George%20Murray%20Smith">George Smith</a>. Emily refused to go with them. The women spent several days in his company. Many years after Anne's death, he wrote in the <a href="Cornhill%20Magazine">Cornhill Magazine</a> his impressions of her, describing her as:
"a gentle, quiet, rather subdued person, by no means pretty, yet of a pleasing appearance. Her manner was curiously expressive of a wish for protection and encouragement, a kind of constant appeal which invited sympathy."

The increasing popularity of the Bells' work led to renewed interest in the "Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell", originally published by Aylott and Jones. The remaining print run was bought by Smith and Elder, and reissued under new covers in November 1848. It still sold poorly.

Although Anne and her sisters were only in their late twenties, a highly successful literary career appeared a certainty for them. However, an impending tragedy was to engulf the family. Within the next ten months, three of the siblings, including Anne, would be dead.

Branwell's health had deteriorated over two years, but its seriousness was disguised by his persistent drunkenness. He died on the morning of 24 September 1848. His sudden death came as a shock to the family. He was aged 31. The cause was recorded as chronic bronchitis – <a href="marasmus">marasmus</a>; though it is now believed he was suffering from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>.

The family had suffered from coughs and colds during the winter of 1848, and Emily next became severely ill. She deteriorated rapidly over two months, persistently refusing all medical aid until the morning of 19 December, when, being very weak, she declared: "if you will send for a doctor, I will see him now". It was, however, far too late. At about two o'clock that afternoon, after a hard, short conflict in which she struggled desperately to hang on to life, she died, aged 30.

Emily's death deeply affected Anne, and her grief undermined her physical health. Over Christmas, Anne caught influenza. Her symptoms intensified, and her father sent for a <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> physician in early January. The doctor diagnosed her condition as <a href="tuberculosis">consumption</a> (tuberculosis) and intimated that it was quite advanced, leaving little hope of recovery. Anne met the news with characteristic determination and self-control. However, she expressed her frustration over unfulfilled ambitions in her letter to Ellen Nussey:

Unlike Emily, Anne took all the recommended medicines and followed the advice she was given. That same month she wrote her last poem, "A dreadful darkness closes in", in which she deals with being terminally ill. Her health fluctuated as the months passed, but she progressively grew thinner and weaker.

In February 1849, Anne seemed somewhat better. She decided to make a return visit to Scarborough in the hope that the change of location and fresh sea air might initiate a recovery. Charlotte was initially against that journey, fearing that it would be too stressful for her sister, but the doctor's approval of this plan and Anne's assurance that it was the last hope, changed her mind. On 24 May 1849, Anne said her goodbyes to her father and the servants at Haworth, and set off for Scarborough with Charlotte and <a href="Ellen%20Nussey">Ellen Nussey</a>. En route, they spent a day and a night in York, where, escorting Anne around in a wheelchair, they did some shopping, and at Anne's request, visited York Minster. However, it was clear that Anne had little strength left.

On Sunday, 27 May, Anne asked Charlotte whether it would be easier if she returned home to die instead of remaining in Scarborough. A doctor, consulted the next day, indicated that death was close. Anne received the news quietly. She expressed her love and concern for Ellen and Charlotte, and seeing Charlotte's distress, whispered to her to "take courage". Conscious and calm, Anne died at about two o'clock in the afternoon, Monday, 28 May 1849.

Over the following days, Charlotte made the decision to "lay the flower where it had fallen". Anne was buried, not in Haworth with the rest of her family, but in Scarborough. The funeral was held on Wednesday 30 May which did not allow time for Patrick Brontë to make the journey, had he wished to do so. The former schoolmistress at Roe Head, Miss Wooler, was in Scarborough and she was the only other mourner at Anne's funeral. She was buried in <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Scarborough">St Mary's</a> churchyard, beneath the castle walls, overlooking the bay. Charlotte commissioned a stone to be placed over her grave, with the simple inscription "Here lie the remains of Anne Brontë, daughter of the Revd P. Brontë, Incumbent of Haworth, Yorkshire. She died Aged 28 May 28th 1849". When Charlotte visited the grave three years later, she discovered multiple errors on the headstone, and thus it was refaced. However, Anne's age at death was still written as 28 when, in fact, she was 29 when she died.

In 2011, the Brontë Society installed a new plaque at Anne Brontë's grave. Due to weathering and erosion, the original gravestone had become illegible at places and could not be restored. The original stone was left undisturbed, while the new plaque, laid horizontally, interpreted the fading words of the original, and also added a correction to the remaining error on the headstone (Anne's age at death). In April 2013, the Brontë Society held a dedication and blessing service at the gravesite to mark the installation of the new plaque.

A year after Anne's death, further editions of her novels were reprinted but Charlotte prevented re-publication of "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall". In 1850, Charlotte wrote ""Wildfell Hall" it hardly appears to me desirable to preserve. The choice of subject in that work is a mistake, it was too little consonant with the character, tastes and ideas of the gentle, retiring inexperienced writer." Subsequent critics paid less attention to Anne's work, and those such as Lane dismissed her as a "a Brontë without genius" and gave her output little consideration. However, in recent years, with increasing critical interest in female authors, her life has been re-examined and her work re-evaluated. Her interest in the topic of education has also been explored in publications such as The Brontes and Education, a Bronte Society Conference publication. Biographies by <a href="Winifred%20G%C3%A9rin">Winifred Gérin</a> (1959), Elizabeth Langland (1989) and Edward Chitham (1991) as well as Juliet Barker's group biography, "The Brontës" (1994; revised edition 2000) and work by critics such as <a href="Inga-Stina%20Ewbank">Inga-Stina Ewbank</a>, Marianne Thormählen, Laura C Berry, Jan B Gordon, Mary Summers and Juliet McMaster, has led to her acceptance, not as a minor Brontë, but as a major literary figure in her own right. Sally McDonald of the Brontë Society said in 2013, "In some ways though she is now viewed as the most radical of the sisters, writing about tough subjects such as women's need to maintain independence and how alcoholism can tear a family apart."

Augustine of Hippo

Augustine of Hippo ( or ; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430) was an early <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">North African</a> <a href="Christian%20theologian">Christian theologian</a> and <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> whose writings influenced the development of <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western Christianity</a> and <a href="Western%20philosophy">Western philosophy</a>. He was the <a href="bishop">bishop</a> of <a href="Hippo%20Regius">Hippo Regius</a> in north Africa and is viewed as one of the most important <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a> in Western Christianity for his writings in the <a href="Patristics">Patristic Era</a>. Among his most important works are "<a href="The%20City%20of%20God%20%28book%29">The City of God</a>" and "<a href="Confessions%20%28Augustine%29">Confessions</a>."

According to his contemporary, <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>, Augustine "established anew the ancient Faith." In his early years, he was influenced by <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaeism</a> and afterward by the <a href="neo-Platonism">neo-Platonism</a> of <a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a>. After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 386, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives. Believing that the <a href="Grace%20in%20Christianity">grace of Christ</a> was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a> and made seminal contributions to the development of <a href="just%20war%20theory">just war theory</a>. When the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> began to disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept of the Church as a spiritual <a href="New%20Jerusalem%23Christianity">City of God</a>, distinct from the material Earthly City. His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. The segment of the Church that adhered to the concept of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> as defined by the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Council of Nicaea</a> and the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">Council of Constantinople</a> closely identified with Augustine's "<a href="On%20the%20Trinity">On the Trinity</a>".

Augustine is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Christian Church, and the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> and as a preeminent <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctor of the Church</a>. He is also the patron of the <a href="Augustinians">Augustinians</a>. His memorial is celebrated on 28 August, the day of his death. Augustine is the <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of brewers, printers, theologians, the alleviation of sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses. Many <a href="Protestantism">Protestants</a>, especially <a href="Calvinism">Calvinists</a> and <a href="Lutheranism">Lutherans</a>, consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> due to his teachings on <a href="salvation">salvation</a> and <a href="divine%20grace">divine grace</a>. Lutherans, and <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> in particular, have held Augustine in preeminence (after the Bible and St. Paul). Luther himself was a member of the Order of the Augustinian Eremites (1505–1521).

In the <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">East</a>, some of his teachings are disputed and have in the 20th century in particular come under attack by such theologians as <a href="John%20Romanides">John Romanides</a>. But other theologians and figures of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> have shown significant appropriation of his writings, chiefly <a href="Georges%20Florovsky">Georges Florovsky</a>. The most controversial doctrine surrounding his name is the <a href="filioque">filioque</a>, which has been rejected by the Orthodox Church. Other disputed teachings include his views on original sin, the doctrine of grace, and <a href="predestination">predestination</a>. Nevertheless, though considered to be mistaken on some points, he is still considered a saint, and has even had influence on some Eastern <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a>, most notably <a href="Saint%20Gregory%20Palamas">Saint Gregory Palamas</a>. In the Orthodox Church his feast day is celebrated on 15 June. Church scholar and historian <a href="Diarmaid%20MacCulloch">Diarmaid MacCulloch</a> writes "his impact on Western Christian thought can hardly be overstated; only his beloved example <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul of Tarsus</a>, has been more influential, and Westerners have generally seen Paul through Augustine's eyes."

Augustine of Hippo (, , or ; ; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430), also known as "Saint Augustine", "Saint Austin", ( or ), is known by various cognomens throughout the Christian world across its many denominations including "Blessed Augustine", and the "Doctor of Grace" ()

<a href="Hippo%20Regius">Hippo Regius</a>, where Augustine was the <a href="bishop">bishop</a>, was in modern-day <a href="Annaba">Annaba</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, located in <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a> (<a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman province of Africa</a>).

Augustine was born in the year 354 AD in the <a href="municipium">municipium</a> of Thagaste (now <a href="Souk%20Ahras">Souk Ahras</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>) in <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman Africa</a>. His mother, <a href="Saint%20Monica">Monica</a> or <a href="Saint%20Monica">Monnica</a>, was a devout Christian; his father Patricius was a Pagan who converted to Christianity on his deathbed. Scholars generally agree that Augustine and his family were <a href="Berbers">Berbers</a>, an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa, but that they were heavily Romanized, speaking only Latin at home as a matter of pride and dignity. In his writings, Augustine leaves some information as to the consciousness of his African heritage. For example, he refers to <a href="Apuleius">Apuleius</a> as "the most notorious of us Africans," to Ponticianus as "a country man of ours, insofar as being African," and to <a href="Faustus%20of%20Mileve">Faustus of Mileve</a> as "an African <a href="Gentleman">Gentleman</a>."

Augustine's family name, Aurelius, suggests that his father's ancestors were <a href="liberti">freedmen</a> of the "<a href="Aurelia%20%28gens%29">gens Aurelia</a>" given full Roman citizenship by the <a href="Edict%20of%20Caracalla">Edict of Caracalla</a> in 212. Augustine's family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born. It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of <a href="Berbers">Berber</a> origin, on the basis of her name, but as his family were "<a href="Decurion%20%28administrative%29">honestiores</a>", an upper class of citizens known as honorable men, Augustine's first language is likely to have been Latin.

At the age of 11, Augustine was sent to school at Madaurus (now <a href="M%27Daourouch">M'Daourouch</a>), a small <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a>n city about south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with <a href="Latin%20literature">Latin literature</a>, as well as pagan beliefs and practices. His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden. He tells this story in his autobiography, "The Confessions". He remembers that he did not steal the fruit because he was hungry, but because "it was not permitted." His very nature, he says, was flawed. 'It was foul, and I loved it. I loved my own error—not that for which I erred, but the error itself." From this incident he concluded the human person is naturally inclined to sin, and in need of the grace of Christ.

At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus, Augustine went to <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> to continue his education in <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>. It was while he was a student in Carthage that he read <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>'s <a href="dialogue">dialogue</a> "<a href="Hortensius%20%28Cicero%29">Hortensius</a>" (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression and sparking his interest in philosophy. Although raised as a Christian, Augustine left the church to follow the <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaean religion</a>, much to his mother's despair. As a youth Augustine lived a <a href="Hedonism">hedonistic</a> lifestyle for a time, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits. The need to gain their acceptance forced inexperienced boys like Augustine to seek or make up stories about sexual experiences. It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, "Grant me <a href="chastity">chastity</a> and <a href="sexual%20abstinence">continence</a>, but not yet."

At about the age of 19, Augustine began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover for over fifteen years and gave birth to his son Adeodatus, who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries. In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress. (He had to wait for two years because the legal age of marriage for women was twelve.) By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest.

Augustine was from the beginning a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek—he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized that he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.

Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and would remain there for the next nine years. Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay.

Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, <a href="Quintus%20Aurelius%20Symmachus">Symmachus</a>, who while traveling through Carthage had been asked by the imperial court at <a href="Milan">Milan</a> to provide a rhetoric professor. Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers.

Although Augustine showed some fervour for Manichaeism, he was never an initiate or "elect", but an "auditor", the lowest level in the sect's hierarchy. While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, <a href="Faustus%20of%20Mileve">Faustus of Mileve</a>, a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism. In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the <a href="Philosophical%20scepticism">scepticism</a> of the <a href="New%20Academy">New Academy</a> movement. Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths. At Milan, his mother's religiosity, Augustine's own studies in <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a>, and his friend <a href="Simplician">Simplician</a>us all urged him towards Christianity. Initially Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with <a href="Ambrose">Ambrose</a> of Milan, Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed.

Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced. Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired. Augustine arrived in Milan and was immediately taken under the wing by Ambrose. Within his "Confessions", Augustine states, "That man of God received me as a father would, and welcomed my coming as a good bishop should."

Soon, their relationship grew, as Augustine wrote, "And I began to love him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church—but as a friendly man." Augustine visited Ambrose in order to see if Ambrose was one of the greatest speakers and rhetoricians in the world. More interested in his speaking skills than the topic of speech, Augustine quickly discovered that Ambrose was a spectacular orator. Eventually, Augustine says that he was spiritually led into the faith of Christianity.

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a marriage for him. Although Augustine accepted this marriage, for which he had to abandon his concubine, he was deeply hurt by the loss of his lover. He wrote, "My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding." Augustine confessed that he was not a lover of wedlock so much as a slave of lust, so he procured another concubine since he had to wait two years until his fiancée came of age. However, his emotional wound was not healed, even began to fester.

There is evidence that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage. In his "Confessions", he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fiancée, but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines. <a href="Alypius%20of%20Thagaste">Alypius of Thagaste</a> steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at <a href="Cassago%20Brianza">Cassiciacum</a>, a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as "Christianae vitae otium" – the Christian life of leisure.

In late August of 386, at the age of 31, after having heard and been inspired and moved by the story of Ponticianus's and his friends' first reading of the life of <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">Saint Anthony of the Desert</a>, Augustine converted to Christianity. As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him to "take up and read" (), which he took as a divine command to open the Bible and read the first thing he saw. Augustine read from <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Romans">Paul's Epistle to the Romans</a> – the """" section, consisting of chapters 12 to 15 – wherein Paul outlines how the Gospel transforms believers, and the believers' resulting behaviour. The specific part to which Augustine opened his Bible was Romans chapter 13, verses 13 and 14, to wit:
He later wrote an account of his conversion – his very transformation, as Paul described – in his "<a href="Confessions%20%28Augustine%29">Confessions</a>" (), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a>. This work is an outpouring of thanksgiving and penitence. Although it is written as an account of his life, the "Confessions" also talks about the nature of time, causality, free will, and other important philosophical topics. The following is taken from that work:

<a href="Ambrose">Ambrose</a> baptized Augustine, along with his son Adeodatus, in Milan on <a href="Easter%20Vigil">Easter Vigil</a>, April 24–25, 387. A year later, in 388, Augustine completed his <a href="Christian%20apologetics">apology</a> "On the Holiness of the Catholic Church". That year, also, Adeodatus and Augustine returned home to Africa. Augustine's mother Monica died at <a href="Ostia%20Antica">Ostia</a>, Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa. Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine's family's property. Soon after, Adeodatus, too, died. Augustine then sold his patrimony and gave the money to the poor. The only thing he kept was the family house, which he converted into a <a href="monastic">monastic</a> foundation for himself and a group of friends.

In 391 Augustine was <a href="ordination">ordained</a> a <a href="priest">priest</a> in <a href="Hippo%20Regius">Hippo Regius</a> (now <a href="Annaba">Annaba</a>), in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>. He became a famous <a href="preacher">preacher</a> (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered.

In 395, he was made <a href="coadjutor%20Bishop">coadjutor Bishop</a> of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter, hence the name "Augustine of Hippo"; and he gave his property to the church of Thagaste. He remained in that position until his death in 430. He wrote his autobiographical "Confessions" in 397–398. His work "The City of God" was written to console his fellow Christians shortly after the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> had <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28410%29">sacked Rome in 410</a>.

Augustine worked tirelessly in trying to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. Though he had left his monastery, he continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a "<a href="Monastic%20rule">regula</a>" for his monastery that led to his designation as the "<a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of <a href="regular%20clergy">regular clergy</a>."

Much of Augustine's later life was recorded by his friend <a href="Possidius">Possidius</a>, bishop of <a href="Calama%20%28Numidia%29">Calama</a> (present-day <a href="Guelma">Guelma</a>, Algeria), in his "Sancti Augustini Vita". Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine's personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see.

Shortly before Augustine's death the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, a <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> tribe that had converted to <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a>, invaded <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman Africa</a>. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege. According to Possidius, Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential <a href="Psalms">Psalms of David</a> be hung on his walls so that he could read them. He directed that the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved. He died on 28 August 430. Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city. They destroyed all of it but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched.

Augustine was <a href="canonization">canonized</a> by popular acclaim, and later recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by <a href="Pope%20Boniface%20VIII">Pope Boniface VIII</a>. His <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> is 28 August, the day on which he died. He is considered the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.

According to <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "True Martyrology", Augustine's body was later <a href="Translation%20%28relic%29">translated</a> or moved to <a href="Cagliari">Cagliari</a>, <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by <a href="Huneric">Huneric</a>. Around 720, his remains were transported again by Peter, <a href="bishop%20of%20Pavia">bishop of Pavia</a> and uncle of the Lombard king <a href="Liutprand%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Lombards">Liutprand</a>, to the church of <a href="San%20Pietro%20in%20Ciel%20d%27Oro">San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro</a> in Pavia, in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s. In January 1327, <a href="Pope%20John%20XXII">Pope John XXII</a> issued the papal bull "Veneranda Santorum Patrum", in which he appointed the <a href="Augustinians">Augustinians</a> guardians of the tomb of Augustine (called "Arca"), which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life.

In October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing some human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the <a href="regular%20canons">regular canons</a> (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed that they were. Eventually <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIII">Pope Benedict XIII</a> (1724–1730) directed the Bishop of Pavia, <a href="Monsignor">Monsignor</a> Pertusati, to make a determination. The bishop declared that, in his opinion, the bones were those of Saint Augustine.

The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled "Arca", which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair, but was finally rebuilt in the 1870s, under the urging of <a href="Agostino%20Gaetano%20Riboldi">Agostino Gaetano Riboldi</a>, and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.

Augustine's large contribution of writings covered diverse fields including theology, philosophy and sociology. Along with John Chrysostom, Augustine was among the most prolific scholars of the early church by quantity of surviving writings.

Augustine was one of the first Christian <a href="Late%20Latin">ancient Latin</a> authors with a very clear vision of <a href="Christian%20anthropology">theological anthropology</a>. He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise "" (420 AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human <a href="person">person</a>. Augustine's favourite figure to describe "body-soul" unity is marriage: "caro tua, coniunx tua – your body is your wife".

Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo%23Original%20sin">fall of humanity</a> they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions. Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.

Augustine was not preoccupied, as <a href="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="Descartes">Descartes</a> were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.

Like other Church Fathers such as <a href="Athenagoras%20of%20Athens">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>, <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> and <a href="Basil%20of%20Caesarea">Basil of Caesarea</a>, Augustine "vigorously condemned the practice of induced <a href="abortion">abortion</a>", and although he disapproved of an abortion during any stage of pregnancy, he made a distinction between early abortions and later ones. He acknowledged the distinction between "formed" and "unformed" fetuses mentioned in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> translation of , which is considered as wrong translation of the word "harm" from the original Hebrew text as "form" in the Greek Septuagint and based in Aristotelian distinction "between the fetus before and after its supposed 'vivification'", and did not classify as murder the abortion of an "unformed" fetus since he thought that it could not be said with certainty that the fetus had already received a soul.

Augustine held that "the timing of the infusion of the soul was a mystery known to God alone". However, he considered procreation as one of the goods of marriage; abortion figured as a means, along with drugs which cause sterility, of frustrating this good. It lay along a continuum which included infanticide as an instance of ‘lustful cruelty’ or ‘cruel lust.’ Augustine called the use of means to avoid the birth of a child an ‘evil work:’ a reference to either abortion or contraception or both." Because of "the defective science of his day", Bishop <a href="Robert%20F.%20Vasa">Robert F. Vasa</a> claims that Augustine would be convinced that an "unformed" fetus had already received a soul "if Augustine had access to ultrasound images or if he had seen the film, "<a href="The%20Silent%20Scream">The Silent Scream</a>"."

In "City of God", Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings. In "The Literal Interpretation of Genesis", Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven calendar days like a literal interpretation of <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a <a href="framework%20interpretation%20%28Genesis%29">logical framework</a>, rather than the passage of time in a physical way – it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in <a href="Sirach">Sirach</a> 18:1, "creavit omnia simul" ("He created all things at once"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally.

Augustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve</a> were already created mortal before <a href="Fall%20of%20man">the Fall</a>. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that we should be willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up.

Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the <a href="Donatist">Donatist</a> sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional <a href="hierarchy%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">hierarchy</a>, the <a href="Sacraments%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic sacraments</a>, and the <a href="laity">laity</a>) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of "wheat" and "tares", that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a <a href="state%20%28theology%29">state of grace</a> were the "true" or "pure" church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.

Augustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in "<a href="The%20City%20of%20God%20%28book%29">City of God</a>". There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed <a href="Cyprian">Cyprian</a> in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the <a href="apostolic%20succession">successors of the Apostles</a>, and that their authority in the Church is God-given.

Augustine originally believed in <a href="premillennialism">premillennialism</a>, namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general <a href="resurrection">resurrection</a>, but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of <a href="amillennialism">amillennialism</a>, although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern <a href="postmillennialism">postmillennialists</a>. The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.

During the <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a> theologians such as <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death, and that <a href="purgatory">purgatorial</a> fires of the <a href="intermediate%20state">intermediate state</a> purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.

Although Augustine did not develop an independent <a href="Mariology">Mariology</a>, his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers. Even before the <a href="Council%20of%20Ephesus">Council of Ephesus</a>, he defended the <a href="perpetual%20virginity%20of%20Mary">Ever-Virgin Mary</a> as the <a href="theotokos">Mother of God</a>, believing her to be "full of grace" (following earlier Latin writers such as <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>) on account of her sexual integrity and innocence. Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary "conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever."

Augustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and our God-given reason, the Biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this "literal sense" does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>.

Augustine taught that the sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness ("insipientia") followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first. The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the <a href="Tree%20of%20the%20knowledge%20of%20good%20and%20evil">Tree of the knowledge of good and evil</a> (Gen 2:17). The tree was a symbol of the order of creation. Self-centeredness made Adam and Eve eat of it, thus failing to acknowledge and respect the world as it was created by God, with its hierarchy of beings and values.

They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if <a href="Satan">Satan</a> hadn't sown into their senses "the root of evil" ("radix Mali"). Their nature was wounded by <a href="concupiscence">concupiscence</a> or <a href="libido">libido</a>, which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire. In terms of <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, concupiscence is not a being but bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.

Augustine's understanding of the consequences of original sin and the necessity of redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against <a href="Pelagius">Pelagius</a> and his <a href="Pelagianism">Pelagian</a> disciples, <a href="Caelestius">Caelestius</a> and <a href="Julian%20of%20Eclanum">Julian of Eclanum</a>, who had been inspired by Rufinus of Syria, a disciple of <a href="Theodore%20of%20Mopsuestia">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>. They refused to agree that original sin wounded human will and mind, insisting that the human nature was given the power to act, to speak, and to think when God created it. Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not to act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it.

Like <a href="Jovinian">Jovinian</a>, Pelagians insisted that human affections and desires were not touched by the fall either. Immorality, "e.g." <a href="fornication">fornication</a>, is exclusively a matter of will, "i.e." a person does not use natural desires in a proper way. In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God.

Augustine had served as a "Hearer" for the Manichaeans for about nine years, who taught that the original sin was <a href="carnal%20knowledge">carnal knowledge</a>. But his struggle to understand the cause of evil in the world started before that, at the age of nineteen. By "malum" (evil) he understood most of all <a href="concupiscence">concupiscence</a>, which he interpreted as a vice dominating person and causing in men and women moral disorder. Agostino Trapè insists that Augustine's personal experience cannot be credited for his doctrine about concupiscence. He considers Augustine's marital experience to be quite normal, and even exemplary, aside from the absence of Christian wedding rites. As J. Brachtendorf showed, Augustine used Ciceronian <a href="Stoicism">Stoic</a> concept of passions, to interpret <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul's</a> doctrine of universal sin and redemption.
The view that not only human <a href="soul">soul</a> but also senses were influenced by the fall of Adam and Eve was prevalent in Augustine's time among the <a href="Fathers%20of%20the%20Church">Fathers of the Church</a>. It is clear that the reason for Augustine's distancing from the affairs of the flesh was different from that of <a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a>, a neo-Platonist who taught that only through disdain for fleshly desire could one reach the ultimate state of mankind. Augustine taught the redemption, i.e. transformation and purification, of the body in the resurrection.

Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against <a href="human%20sexuality">human sexuality</a> and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the "Confessions". But in view of his writings it is apparently a misunderstanding. Augustine taught that human sexuality has been wounded, together with the whole of human nature, and requires <a href="Redemption%20%28theology%29">redemption</a> of Christ. That healing is a process realized in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a "remedium concupiscentiae" – remedy of concupiscence. The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body.

The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin is transmitted to his descendants by <a href="concupiscence">concupiscence</a>, which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body, making humanity a "massa damnata" (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will.

Augustine's formulation of the doctrine of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils, "i.e." <a href="Council%20of%20Carthage%20%28418%29">Carthage (418)</a>, <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Ephesus">Ephesus</a> (431), <a href="Council%20of%20Orange%20%28529%29">Orange</a> (529), <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Trent</a> (1546) and by popes, "i.e." <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20I">Pope Innocent I</a> (401–417) and <a href="Pope%20Zosimus">Pope Zosimus</a> (417–418). <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a> established in his "<a href="Cur%20Deus%20Homo">Cur Deus Homo</a>" the definition that was followed by the great 13th-century Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the "privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess", thus separating it from "concupiscence", with which some of Augustine's disciples had defined it as later did Luther and Calvin. In 1567, <a href="Pope%20Pius%20V">Pope Pius V</a> condemned the identification of Original Sin with concupiscence.

Augustine taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom. Prior to 396, he believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe, that God's grace was "a reward for human assent". Later, in response to <a href="Pelagius">Pelagius</a>, Augustine said that the sin of <a href="pride">pride</a> consists in assuming that "we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us", and argued that God's grace causes individual act of faith.

Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies <a href="double%20predestination">double predestination</a>, or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars have held that Augustine did believe in double predestination. Some Protestant theologians, such as <a href="Justo%20L.%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Justo L. González</a> and <a href="Bengt%20H%C3%A4gglund">Bengt Hägglund</a>, interpret Augustine's teaching that grace is <a href="irresistible%20grace">irresistible</a>, results in conversion, and leads to <a href="perseverance%20of%20the%20saints">perseverance</a>.

In "On Rebuke and Grace" ("De correptione et gratia"), Augustine wrote: "And what is written, that He wills all men to be saved, while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings of mine; but here I will say one thing: He wills all men to be saved, is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them."

Also in reaction against the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the "regularity" and "validity" of the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s. Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them ("<a href="ex%20opere%20operato">ex opere operato</a>"); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of <a href="Cyprian">Cyprian</a>, who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised. Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.

Augustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the <a href="real%20presence%20of%20Christ%20in%20the%20Eucharist">real presence of Christ in the Eucharist</a>, saying that Christ's statement, "This is my body" referred to the bread he carried in his hands, and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes.

Against the <a href="Pelagians">Pelagians</a>, Augustine strongly stressed the importance of <a href="infant%20baptism">infant baptism</a>. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved. This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his "City of God", concerning the <a href="Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>, may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.

Augustine's contemporaries often believed <a href="astrology">astrology</a> to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called "mathemathici". Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a>s. (Augustine's term "mathematici", meaning "astrologers", is sometimes mistranslated as "mathematicians".) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a> or <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> but "common swindlers".

<a href="Epistemology">Epistemological</a> concerns shaped Augustine's intellectual development. His early dialogues ["Contra academicos" (386) and "De Magistro" (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of <a href="divine%20illumination">divine illumination</a>. The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays an active and regular part in human perception (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes' idea of clear and distinct perceptions) and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents. According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of <a href="sense%20perception">sense perception</a>. It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities.

Augustine also posed the <a href="problem%20of%20other%20minds">problem of other minds</a> throughout different works, most famously perhaps in "<a href="On%20the%20Trinity">On the Trinity</a>" (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds. In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of <a href="Philosophical%20problems%20of%20testimony">testimony</a> to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.

Augustine asserted that Christians should be <a href="pacifists">pacifists</a> as a personal, philosophical stance. However, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defence of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine coined the phrase in his work "The City of God". In essence, the pursuit of peace must include the option of fighting for its long-term preservation. Such a war could not be pre-emptive, but defensive, to restore peace. <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>, centuries later, used the authority of Augustine's arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just.

Included in Augustine's <a href="theodicy">theodicy</a> is the claim that God created humans and angels as rational beings possessing <a href="free%20will">free will</a>. Free will was not intended for sin, meaning it is not equally predisposed to both good and evil. A will defiled by sin is not considered as "free" as it once was because it is bound by material things, which could be lost or be difficult to part with, resulting in unhappiness. Sin impairs free will, while grace restores it. Only a will that was once free can be subjected to sin's corruption.

The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will. He often said that anyone can be saved if they wish. While God knows who will and won't be saved, with no possibility for the latter to be saved in their lives, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.

Augustine led many clergy under his authority at Hippo to free their slaves "as an act of piety." He boldly wrote a letter urging the emperor to set up a new law against slave traders and was very much concerned about the sale of children. Christian emperors of his time for 25 years had permitted sale of children, not because they approved of the practice, but as a way of preventing <a href="infanticide">infanticide</a> when parents were unable to care for a child. Augustine noted that the tenant farmers in particular were driven to hire out or to sell their children as a means of survival.

In his book, "The City of God", he presents the development of slavery as a product of sin and as contrary to God's divine plan. He wrote that God "did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation – not man over man, but man over the beasts." Thus he wrote that righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle, not kings over men. "The condition of slavery is the result of sin", he declared. In "The City of God", Augustine wrote he felt slavery was not a punishment. He wrote: "Slavery is not penal in character and planned by that law which commands the preservation of the natural order and forbids disturbance."

Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of <a href="Hebrew%20Scripture">Hebrew Scripture</a>, Augustine countered that God had chosen the <a href="Jews">Jews</a> as a special people, and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy. He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely "Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at "the end of time", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands. The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews "survive but not thrive" (it is repeated by author <a href="James%20Carroll%20%28author%29">James Carroll</a> in his book "Constantine's Sword", for example) is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.

For Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In "On Christian Doctrine" Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God. Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse ("On marriage and concupiscence" 1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate the species inevitably perpetuates evil ("On marriage and concupiscence" 1.27; "A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians" 2.27). For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the "better" way ("Confessions" 8.2) and abstain from marriage ("On marriage and concupiscence" 1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, for Augustine a sin, although necessarily producing the evil of sexual passion. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act.

Before the Fall, Augustine believed that sex was a passionless affair, "just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat"; the penis would have been engorged for sexual intercourse "simply by the direction of the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence" ("On marriage and concupiscence" 2.29; cf. "City of God" 14.23). After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: "Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind... It arouses the mind, but it does not follow through what it has begun and arouse the body also" ("City of God" 14.16).

Augustine believed that Adam and Eve had both already chosen in their hearts to disobey God's command not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge before Eve took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to Adam. Accordingly, Augustine did not believe that Adam was any less guilty of sin. Augustine does praise women and their role in society and in the Church. In his "Tractates on the Gospel of John", Augustine, commenting on the <a href="Samaritan">Samaritan</a> woman from John 4:1–42, uses the woman as a figure of the Church in agreement with the New Testament teaching that the Church is the bride of Christ. "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her." 

Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is "De Magistro" (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education. His ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Saint Augustine wrote his "Retractationes", reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of "retractationes" may be "reconsiderations". Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Saint Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding, meaning, and truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development, and change.

Augustine was a strong advocate of <a href="critical%20thinking">critical thinking</a> skills. Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Saint Augustine's dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.

He recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds:

If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between "having words and having understanding" and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

Under the influence of <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin</a>, and <a href="Rabanus%20Maurus">Rabanus Maurus</a>, "De catechizandis rudibus" came to exercise an important role in the education of clergy at the monastic schools, especially from the eighth century onwards.

Augustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The "mixed style" includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The "grand style" is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional <a href="Bible">Bible</a>-based practice of strict discipline.

Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles. They include <a href="apologetics">apologetic</a> works against the heresies of the <a href="Arianism">Arians</a>, <a href="Donatists">Donatists</a>, <a href="Manichaeans">Manichaeans</a> and <a href="Pelagians">Pelagians</a>; texts on Christian <a href="doctrine">doctrine</a>, notably "<a href="De%20Doctrina%20Christiana">De Doctrina Christiana</a>" ("On Christian Doctrine"); <a href="exegesis">exegetical</a> works such as commentaries on <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a>, the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a> and <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">Paul's</a> <a href="Letter%20to%20the%20Romans">Letter to the Romans</a>; many <a href="sermon">sermon</a>s and <a href="Letter%20%28message%29">letters</a>; and the "Retractationes", a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.

Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his "<a href="Confessions%20%28Augustine%29">Confessions</a>", which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for "De civitate Dei" ("<a href="The%20City%20of%20God%20%28book%29">The City of God</a>", consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28410%29">sack of Rome</a> by the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> in 410. His "<a href="On%20the%20Trinity">On the Trinity</a>", in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>, is also considered to be among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time. He also wrote "On Free Choice of the Will" ("<a href="De%20libero%20arbitrio%20%28Augustine%29">De libero arbitrio</a>"), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.

In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>, <a href="Platonism">Platonism</a> and <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a>, particularly by the work of <a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a>, author of the "<a href="Enneads">Enneads</a>", probably through the mediation of <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry</a> and <a href="Gaius%20Marius%20Victorinus">Victorinus</a> (as <a href="Pierre%20Hadot">Pierre Hadot</a> has argued). Although he later abandoned Neoplatonism, some ideas are still visible in his early writings. His early and influential writing on the <a href="Will%20%28philosophy%29">human will</a>, a central topic in <a href="ethics">ethics</a>, would become a focus for later philosophers such as <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>, <a href="S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard">Kierkegaard</a>, and <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>. He was also influenced by the works of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> (known for his teaching on language), and <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> (known for his teaching on argument).

<a href="Philosopher">Philosopher</a> <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the "Confessions", comparing it favourably to <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a>'s version of the view that time is subjective. Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists <a href="eternity">outside of time</a> in the "eternal present"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of <a href="memory">memory</a>. <a href="Frances%20Yates">Frances Yates</a> in her 1966 study "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Memory">The Art of Memory</a>" argues that a brief passage of the "Confessions", 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> technique for organizing large amounts of information.
Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his "Confessions", had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern <a href="Phenomenology%20%28philosophy%29">phenomenology</a> and <a href="hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a>. <a href="Edmund%20Husserl">Edmund Husserl</a> writes: "The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem."

<a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a> refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work "<a href="Being%20and%20Time">Being and Time</a>". <a href="Hannah%20Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a> began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, "Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin" (1929): "The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for "vita socialis" in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity."

Jean Bethke Elshtain in "Augustine and the Limits of Politics" tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: "Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> as merely banal [in "<a href="Eichmann%20in%20Jerusalem">Eichmann in Jerusalem</a>"]."

Augustine's philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th-century figures. Seen from a historical perspective, there are three main perspectives on the political thought of Augustine: first, political Augustinianism; second, Augustinian political theology; and third, Augustinian political theory.

<a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall, without "supernatural gifts". While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see <a href="total%20depravity">total depravity</a>).

According to <a href="Leo%20Ruickbie">Leo Ruickbie</a>, Augustine's arguments against <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>, differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against <a href="paganism">paganism</a> and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, <a href="Freudianism">Freudianism</a> and eco-fundamentalism. Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine's thought, particularly "The City of God", in their book of political philosophy "Empire".

Augustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as <a href="John%20Piper%20%28theologian%29">John Piper</a>. <a href="Hannah%20Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a>, an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> extensively quotes Augustine in "<a href="Philosophical%20Investigations">Philosophical Investigations</a>" for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the "<a href="Confessions%20%28Augustine%29">Confessions</a>". Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Saussure">Ferdinand de Saussure</a>, who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of <a href="semiotics">semiotics</a>, but rather built upon <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian</a> and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: "as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies."

In his autobiographical book "Milestones", <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> claims Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought.

Much of Augustine's conversion is dramatized in the oratorio "La conversione di Sant'Agostino" (1750) composed by <a href="Johann%20Adolph%20Hasse">Johann Adolph Hasse</a>. The libretto for this oratorio, written by <a href="Duchess%20Maria%20Antonia%20of%20Bavaria">Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria</a>, draws upon the influence of <a href="Pietro%20Metastasio">Metastasio</a> (the finished libretto having been edited by him) and is based off an earlier five-act play "Idea perfectae conversionis dive Augustinus" written by the Jesuit priest <a href="Franz%20Neumayr">Franz Neumayr</a>. In the libretto Augustine's mother Monica is presented as a prominent character that is worried that Augustine might not convert to Christianity. As Dr. Andrea Palent says: Throughout the oratorio Augustine shows his willingness to turn to God, but the burden of the act of conversion weighs heavily on him. This is displayed by Hasse through extended recitative passages.

Acting

Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an <a href="actor">actor</a> or actress who adopts a <a href="Character%20%28arts%29">character</a>—in <a href="theatre">theatre</a>, <a href="television">television</a>, <a href="film">film</a>, <a href="radio">radio</a>, or any other medium that makes use of the <a href="Mimesis">mimetic</a> <a href="Mode%20%28literature%29">mode</a>.

Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed <a href="imagination">imagination</a>, emotional facility, physical expressivity, <a href="vocal%20projection">vocal projection</a>, clarity of <a href="Speech%20communication">speech</a>, and the ability to interpret <a href="drama">drama</a>. Acting also demands an ability to employ <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s, <a href="Accent%20%28sociolinguistics%29">accents</a>, <a href="improvisational%20theatre">improvisation</a>, observation and emulation, <a href="Mime%20artist">mime</a>, and <a href="stage%20combat">stage combat</a>. Many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera.

Most <a href="History%20of%20theatre">early sources</a> in the <a href="Western%20culture">West</a> that examine the <a href="art">art</a> of acting (, "hypokrisis") discuss it as part of <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>.

One of the first <a href="actor">actor</a>s is believed to have been an <a href="Classical%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> called <a href="Thespis">Thespis</a> of Icaria. Writing two centuries after the event, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in his "<a href="Poetics%20%28Aristotle%29">Poetics</a>" (c. 335 BCE) suggests that Thespis stepped out of the <a href="dithyramb">dithyramb</a>ic <a href="Greek%20chorus">chorus</a> and addressed it as a separate <a href="Character%20%28arts%29">character</a>. Before Thespis, the chorus <a href="Narration">narrated</a> (for example, "Dionysus did this, Dionysus said that"). When Thespis stepped out from the chorus, he spoke as if he was the character (for example, "I am Dionysus. I did this"). To distinguish between these different <a href="Mode%20%28literature%29">modes</a> of storytelling—enactment and narration—Aristotle uses the terms "<a href="mimesis">mimesis</a>" (via enactment) and "<a href="diegesis">diegesis</a>" (via narration). From Thespis' name derives the word "thespian".

A professional actor is someone who is paid to act. Professional actors sometimes undertake unpaid work for a variety of reasons, including educational purposes or for charity events. <a href="Amateur%20theatre">Amateur actors</a> are those who do not receive payment for performances.

Not all people working as actors in <a href="film">film</a>, <a href="television">television</a>, or <a href="theatre">theatre</a> are professionally trained. <a href="Bob%20Hoskins">Bob Hoskins</a>, for example, had no formal training before becoming an actor.

Conservatories and <a href="drama%20school">drama school</a>s typically offer two- to four-year training on all aspects of acting. Universities mostly offer three- to four-year programs, in which a student is often able to choose to focus on acting, whilst continuing to learn about other aspects of <a href="theatre">theatre</a>. Schools vary in their approach, but in North America the most popular method taught derives from the <a href="Stanislavski%27s%20system">'system'</a> of <a href="Konstantin%20Stanislavski">Konstantin Stanislavski</a>, which was developed and popularised in America as <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a> by <a href="Lee%20Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a>, <a href="Stella%20Adler">Stella Adler</a>, <a href="Sanford%20Meisner">Sanford Meisner</a>, and others.

Other approaches may include a more physically based orientation, such as that promoted by <a href="theatre%20practitioner">theatre practitioner</a>s as diverse as <a href="Anne%20Bogart">Anne Bogart</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Lecoq">Jacques Lecoq</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Grotowski">Jerzy Grotowski</a>, or <a href="Vsevolod%20Meyerhold">Vsevolod Meyerhold</a>. Classes may also include <a href="psychotechnique">psychotechnique</a>, <a href="mask">mask</a> work, <a href="physical%20theatre">physical theatre</a>, <a href="improvisation">improvisation</a>, and acting for camera.

Regardless of a school's approach, students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation, voice, and movement. Applications to drama programmes and conservatories usually involve extensive <a href="Audition%20%28performing%20arts%29">auditions</a>. Anybody over the age of 18 can usually apply. Training may also start at a very young age. Acting classes and professional schools targeted at under-18s are widespread. These classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre, including scene study.

Increased training and exposure to <a href="public%20speaking">public speaking</a> allows humans to maintain calmer and more relaxed <a href="physiologically">physiologically</a>. By measuring a public speaker’s heart rate maybe one of the easiest ways to judge shifts in stress as the heart rate increases with anxiety . As actors increase performances, heart rate and other evidence of stress can decrease. This is very important in training for actors, as adaptive strategies gained from increased exposure to public speaking can regulate implicit and explicit anxiety. By attending an institution with a specialization in acting, increased opportunity to act will lead to more relaxed physiology and decrease in stress and its effects on the body. These effects can vary from hormonal to cognitive health that can impact quality of life and performance 

Some classical forms of acting involve a substantial element of <a href="Improvisation">improvised</a> performance. Most notable is its use by the troupes of the "<a href="commedia%20dell%27arte">commedia dell'arte</a>", a form of <a href="mask">mask</a>ed comedy that originated in Italy.

Improvisation as an approach to acting formed an important part of the Russian <a href="theatre%20practitioner">theatre practitioner</a> <a href="Konstantin%20Stanislavski">Konstantin Stanislavski</a>'s <a href="Stanislavski%27s%20system">'system'</a> of actor training, which he developed from the 1910s onwards. Late in 1910, the playwright <a href="Maxim%20Gorky">Maxim Gorky</a> invited Stanislavski to join him in <a href="Capri">Capri</a>, where they discussed training and Stanislavski's emerging "grammar" of acting. Inspired by a popular theatre performance in <a href="Naples">Naples</a> that utilised the techniques of the "commedia dell'arte", Gorky suggested that they form a company, modelled on the <a href="Medieval%20theatre">medieval strolling players</a>, in which a playwright and group of young actors would <a href="Devised%20theatre">devise</a> new plays together by means of improvisation. Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio of the <a href="Moscow%20Art%20Theatre">Moscow Art Theatre</a>. Stanislavski's use was extended further in the approaches to acting developed by his students, <a href="Michael%20Chekhov">Michael Chekhov</a> and <a href="Maria%20Knebel">Maria Knebel</a>.

In the United Kingdom, the use of improvisation was pioneered by <a href="Joan%20Littlewood">Joan Littlewood</a> from the 1930s onwards and, later, by <a href="Keith%20Johnstone">Keith Johnstone</a> and Clive Barker. In the United States, it was promoted by <a href="Viola%20Spolin">Viola Spolin</a>, after working with <a href="Neva%20Boyd">Neva Boyd</a> at a Hull House in Chicago, Illinois (Spolin was Boyd's student from 1924 to 1927). Like the British practitioners, Spolin felt that playing games was a useful means of training actors and helped to improve an actor's performance. With improvisation, she argued, people may find expressive freedom, since they do not know how an improvised situation will turn out. Improvisation demands an open mind in order to maintain spontaneity, rather than pre-planning a response. A character is created by the actor, often without reference to a dramatic text, and a drama is developed out of the spontenous interactions with other actors. This approach to creating new drama has been developed most substantially by the British filmmaker <a href="Mike%20Leigh">Mike Leigh</a>, in films such as "<a href="Secrets%20%26amp%3B%20Lies%20%28film%29">Secrets & Lies</a>" (1996), "<a href="Vera%20Drake">Vera Drake</a>" (2004), "<a href="Another%20Year%20%28film%29">Another Year</a>" (2010), and "<a href="Mr.%20Turner">Mr. Turner</a>" (2014).

Improvisation is also used to cover up if an actor or actress makes a mistake.

Speaking or acting in front of an audience is a stressful situation, which causes an increased heart rate(Baldwin, 1980 Lacey, 1995).

In a 2017 study on American university students, actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated heart rates throughout their performances; this agrees with previous studies on professional and amateur actors' heart rates(Konijin,1993). While all actors experienced stress, causing elevated heart rate, the more experienced actors displayed less heart rate variability than the less experienced actors in the same play. The more experienced actors experienced less stress while performing, and therefore had a smaller degree of variability than the less experienced, more stressed actors. The more experienced an actor is, the more stable their heart rate will be while performing, but will still experience elevated heart rates.

The <a href="semiotics">semiotics</a> of acting involves a study of the ways in which aspects of a performance come to operate for its audience as <a href="Sign%20%28semiotics%29">sign</a>s. This process largely involves the production of meaning, whereby elements of an actor's performance acquire significance, both within the broader context of the dramatic action and in the relations each establishes with the real world.

Following the ideas proposed by the <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist</a> theorist <a href="Antonin%20Artaud">Antonin Artaud</a>, however, it may also be possible to understand communication with an audience that occurs 'beneath' significance and meaning (which the semiotician <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Guattari">Félix Guattari</a> described as a process involving the transmission of "a-signifying signs"). In his "<a href="The%20Theatre%20and%20its%20Double">The Theatre and its Double</a>" (1938), Artaud compared this interaction to the way in which a <a href="Snake%20charming">snake charmer</a> communicates with a snake, a process which he identified as "<a href="mimesis">mimesis</a>"—the same term that <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in his "<a href="Poetics%20%28Aristotle%29">Poetics</a>" (c. 335 BCE) used to describe the <a href="Mode%20%28literature%29">mode</a> in which <a href="drama">drama</a> communicates its story, by virtue of its embodiment by the actor enacting it, as distinct from "<a href="diegesis">diegesis</a>", or the way in which a <a href="Narration">narrator</a> may describe it. These "vibrations" passing from the actor to the audience may not necessarily precipiate into significant elements as such (that is, consciously perceived "meanings"), but rather may operate by means of the circulation of "<a href="Affect%20%28philosophy%29">affect</a>s".

The approach to acting adopted by other <a href="theatre%20practitioners">theatre practitioners</a> involve varying degrees of concern with the semiotics of acting. <a href="Konstantin%20Stanislavski">Konstantin Stanislavski</a>, for example, addresses the ways in which an actor, building on what he calls the "experiencing" of a role, should also shape and adjust a performance in order to support the overall significance of the drama—a process that he calls establishing the "perspective of the role". The semiotics of acting plays a far more central role in <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>'s <a href="epic%20theatre">epic theatre</a>, in which an actor is concerned to bring out clearly the sociohistorical significance of behaviour and action by means of specific performance choices—a process that he describes as establishing the "<a href="Not%20/%20But">not/but</a>" element in a performed physical ""<a href="gestus">gestus</a>"" within context of the play's overal ""<a href="Fabel">Fabel</a>"". <a href="Eugenio%20Barba">Eugenio Barba</a> argues that actors ought not to concern themselves with the significance of their performance behaviour; this aspect is the responsibility, he claims, of the <a href="theatre%20director">director</a>, who weaves the signifying elements of an actor's performance into the director's <a href="Dramaturgy">dramaturgical</a> "montage".

The theatre semiotician <a href="Patrice%20Pavis">Patrice Pavis</a>, alluding to the contrast between <a href="Stanislavski%27s%20system">Stanislavski's 'system'</a> and Brecht's <a href="Demonstration%20%28acting%29">demonstrating</a> performer—and, beyond that, to <a href="Denis%20Diderot">Denis Diderot</a>'s foundational essay on the art of acting, "<a href="Paradox%20of%20the%20Actor">Paradox of the Actor</a>" (c. 1770—78)—argues that:
Acting was long seen in terms of the actor's sincerity or hypocrisy—should he believe in what he is saying and be moved by it, or should he distance himself and convey his role in a detached manner? The answer varies according to how one sees the effect to be produced in the audience and the social function of theatre.

Elements of a semiotics of acting include the actor's gestures, facial expressions, intonation and other vocal qualities, rhythm, and the ways in which these aspects of an individual performance relate to the drama and the theatrical event (or film, television programme, or radio broadcast, each of which involves different semiotic systems) considered as a whole. A semiotics of acting recognises that all forms of acting involve <a href="Dramatic%20convention">conventions</a> and <a href="Code%20%28semiotics%29">codes</a> by means of which performance behaviour acquires significance—including those approaches, such as Stanislvaski's or the closely related <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a> developed in the United States, that offer themselves as "a natural kind of acting that can do without conventions and be received as self-evident and universal." Pavis goes on to argue that:
Any acting is based on a codified system (even if the audience does not see it as such) of behaviour and actions that are considered to be believable and realistic or artificial and theatrical. To advocate the natural, the spontaneous, and the instinctive is only to attempt to produce natural effects, governed by an <a href="Ideology">ideological</a> code that determines, at a particular historical time, and for a given audience, what is natural and believable and what is <a href="Declamation">declamatory</a> and theatrical.
The conventions that govern acting in general are related to structured forms of <a href="Play%20%28activity%29">play</a>, which involve, in each specific experience, "<a href="Game">rules of the game</a>." This aspect was first explored by <a href="Johan%20Huizinga">Johan Huizinga</a> (in "<a href="Homo%20Ludens">Homo Ludens</a>", 1938) and <a href="Roger%20Caillois">Roger Caillois</a> (in "<a href="Man%2C%20Play%20and%20Games">Man, Play and Games</a>", 1958). Caillois, for example, distinguishes four apects of play relevant to acting: "<a href="mimesis">mimesis</a>" (<a href="simulation">simulation</a>), "<a href="agon">agon</a>" (<a href="Conflict%20%28narrative%29">conflict</a> or competition), "<a href="Alea%20%28Greek%20soldier%29">alea</a>" (<a href="Indeterminism">chance</a>), and "illinx" (<a href="vertigo">vertigo</a>, or "vertiginous psychological situations" involving the spectator's <a href="Identification%20%28literature%29">identification</a> or <a href="catharsis">catharsis</a>). This connection with play as an activity was first proposed by Aristotle in his "Poetics", in which he defines the desire to imitate in play as an essential part of being human and our first means of <a href="Child%20development">learning as children</a>:
For it is an instinct of human beings, from childhood, to engage in <a href="mimesis">mimesis</a> (indeed, this distinguishes them from other animals: man is the most mimetic of all, and it is through mimesis that he develops his earliest understanding); and equally natural that everyone enjoys mimetic objects. (IV, 1448b)
This connection with play also informed the words used in English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages) for <a href="drama">drama</a>: the word "<a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">play</a>" or "game" (translating the <a href="Old%20English">Anglo-Saxon</a> "plèga" or <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "ludus") was the standard term used until <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s time for a dramatic entertainment—just as its creator was a "play-maker" rather than a "dramatist", the person acting was known as a "player", and, when in the <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan era</a> specific buildings for acting were built, they was known as "play-houses" rather than "<a href="Theater%20%28building%29">theatres</a>."

<a href="Rehearsal">Rehearsal</a> is a process in which actors prepare and practice a performance, exploring the vicissitudes of <a href="Conflict%20%28narrative%29">conflict</a> between <a href="Character%20%28arts%29">character</a>s, testing specific actions in the scene, and finding means to convey a particular sense. Some actors continue to rehearse a scene throughout the run of a show in order to keep the scene fresh in their minds and exciting for the audience.

A critical audience with evaluative spectators is known to induce stress on actors during performance, (see Bode & Brutten) and an actor will typically rate the quality of their performance higher than their spectators. Heart rates are generally always higher during a performance with an audience when compared to rehearsal, however what's interesting is that this audience also seems to induce a higher quality of performance. Simply put, while public performances cause extremely high stress levels in actors (more so amateur ones), the stress actually improves the performance, supporting the idea of "positive stress in challenging situations"

Depending on what an actor is doing, his or her heart rate will vary. This is the body's way of responding to stress. Prior to a show you will see an increase in heart rate due to anxiety. While performing an actor has an increased sense of exposure which will increase <a href="performance%20anxiety">performance anxiety</a> and the associated physiological arousal, such as heart rate. Heart rates increases more during shows compared to rehearsals because of the increased pressure, which is due to the fact that a performance has a potentially greater impact on an actors career. After the show you will see a decrease in the heart rate due to the conclusion of the stress inducing activity. Often the heart rate will return to normal after the show or performance is done; however, during the applause after the performance there is a rapid spike in heart rate. This can be seen not only in actors but also with <a href="public%20speaking">public speaking</a> and <a href="musicians">musicians</a>.

There is a correlation between heart-rate and stress when actors' are performing in front of an audience. Actors claim that having an audience has no change in their stress level, but as soon as they come on stage their heart-rate rises quickly. A 2017 study done in an American University looking at actors' stress by measuring heart-rate showed individual heart-rates rose right before the performance began for those actors opening. There are many factors that can add to an actors' stress. For example, length of monologues, experience level, and actions done on stage including moving the set. Throughout the performance heart-rate rises the most before an actor is speaking. The stress and thus heart-rate of the actor then drops significantly at the end of a monologue, big action scene, or performance. This idea of getting stressed during the anticipation period for any big moment happening is applied throughout the performance. Stress therefore is a bigger impact on the actors overall performance whether motivating or pressuring them to give a more proficient end performance.

Delian League

The Delian League, founded in 478 BC, was an association of <a href="Polis">Greek city-states</a>, members numbering between 150, 173, to 330 under the leadership of <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athens</a>, whose purpose was to continue fighting the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a> after the Greek victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Plataea">Battle of Plataea</a> at the end of the <a href="Second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece">Second Persian invasion of Greece</a>. The League's modern name derives from its official meeting place, the island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a>, where congresses were held in the temple and where the treasury stood until, in a symbolic gesture, <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> moved it to Athens in 454 BC.

Shortly after its inception, Athens began to use the League's navy for its own purposes – which led to its naming by historians as the Athenian Empire. This behavior frequently led to conflict between Athens and the less powerful members of the League. By 431 BC, Athens' heavy-handed control of the Delian League prompted the outbreak of the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>; the League was dissolved upon the war's conclusion in 404 BC under the direction of <a href="Lysander">Lysander</a>, the <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n commander.

The Greco-Persian Wars had their roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and particularly <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>, by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Persian Empire</a> of <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a> shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a <a href="tyrant">tyrant</a> in each Ionian city. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of arbitrary government that was on the decline. By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian <a href="Clientage">clients</a>. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a>, <a href="Aristagoras">Aristagoras</a>. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored <a href="Siege%20of%20Naxos%20%28499%20BC%29">expedition</a> in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy. This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, extending to <a href="Doris%20%28Asia%20Minor%29">Doris</a> and <a href="Aeolis">Aeolis</a>, beginning the <a href="Ionian%20Revolt">Ionian Revolt</a>.

The Greek states of <a href="History%20of%20Athens">Athens</a> and <a href="Eretria">Eretria</a> allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a>. After this, the Ionian revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further five years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king <a href="Darius%20the%20Great">Darius the Great</a> decided that, despite having subdued the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.

In the next two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, occasioning, thanks to Greek historians, some of the most famous battles in history. During the <a href="First%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece">first invasion</a>, <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a> and the <a href="Aegean%20Islands">Aegean Islands</a> were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed. However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marathon">Battle of Marathon</a>. Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son <a href="Xerxes%20I">Xerxes I</a>.

Xerxes then personally led a <a href="second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece">second Persian invasion of Greece</a> in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece. Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated in the twin simultaneous battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> on land and <a href="Battle%20of%20Artemisium">Artemisium</a> at sea. All of Greece except the <a href="Peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</a> thus having fallen into Persian hands, the Persians then seeking to destroy the Allied navy once and for all, suffered a decisive defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Battle of Salamis</a>. The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Plataea">Battle of Plataea</a>, ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.

The Allied fleet defeated the remnants of the Persian fleet in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mycale">Battle of Mycale</a> near the islands of Salamis—on the same day as Plataea, according to tradition. This action marks the end of the Persian invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the Greco-Persian wars, <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars%23Greek%20counterattack">the Greek counterattack</a>. After Mycale, the Greek cities of Asia Minor again revolted, with the Persians now powerless to stop them. The Allied fleet then sailed to the <a href="Thracian%20Chersonese">Thracian Chersonese</a>, still held by the Persians, and besieged and captured the town of <a href="Sestos">Sestos</a>. The following year, 478 BC, the Allies sent a force to capture the city of <a href="Byzantion">Byzantion</a> (modern day <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>). The siege was successful, but the behaviour of the Spartan general <a href="Pausanias%20%28general%29">Pausanias</a> alienated many of the Allies, and resulted in Pausanias's recall.

After Byzantion, Sparta was eager to end its involvement in the war. The Spartans were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece, and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that establishing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion.

Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities had been Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marked the point at which the leadership of the Greek alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantion, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.

The loose alliance of city states which had fought against Xerxes's invasion had been dominated by Sparta and the <a href="Peloponnesian%20league">Peloponnesian league</a>. With the withdrawal of these states, a congress was called on the holy island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a> to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians; hence the modern designation "Delian League". According to Thucydides, the official aim of the League was to "avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king."

In reality, this goal was divided into three main efforts—to prepare for future invasion, to seek revenge against Persia, and to organize a means of dividing spoils of war. The members were given a choice of either offering armed forces or paying a tax to the joint treasury; most states chose the tax. League members swore to have the same friends and enemies, and dropped ingots of iron into the sea to symbolize the permanence of their alliance. The Athenian politician <a href="Aristides">Aristides</a> would spend the rest of his life occupied in the affairs of the alliance, dying (according to <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>) a few years later in Pontus, whilst determining what the tax of new members was to be.

In the first ten years of the league's existence, <a href="Cimon">Cimon/Kimon</a> forced <a href="Karystos">Karystos</a> in <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> to join the league, conquered the island of <a href="Skyros">Skyros</a> and sent Athenian colonists there.

Over time, especially with the suppression of rebellions, Athens exercised <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a> over the rest of the league. <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> describes how Athens's control over the League grew:

The first member of the league to attempt to secede was the island of <a href="Naxos%20Island">Naxos</a> in c. 471 BC. After being defeated, Naxos is believed (based on similar, later revolts) to have been forced to tear down its walls, and lost its fleet and its vote in the League.

In 465 BC, Athens founded the colony of <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a> on the Strymon river. <a href="Thasos">Thasos</a>, a member of the League, saw her interests in the mines of Mt. Pangaion threatened and defected from the League to Persia. She called to Sparta for assistance but was denied, as Sparta was facing the largest <a href="Helots">helot</a> revolution in its history.

An aftermath of the war was that <a href="Cimon">Cimon</a> was <a href="Ostracism">ostracised</a>, and the relations between Athens and Sparta turned hostile. After a three-year siege, Thasos was recaptured and forced back into the League. The siege of Thasos marks the transformation of the Delian league from an alliance into, in the words of Thucydides, a <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a>.

After two years Thasos surrendered to the Athenian leader Cimon. In result, the fortification walls of Thasos were torn down, their land and naval ships were confiscated by Athens. The mines of Thasos were also turned over to Athens, and they had to pay yearly tribute and fines.

In 461 BC, Cimon was <a href="ostracism">ostracized</a> and was succeeded in his influence by democrats such as <a href="Ephialtes">Ephialtes</a> and Pericles. This signaled a complete change in Athenian foreign policy, neglecting the alliance with the Spartans and instead allying with her enemies, <a href="Argos">Argos</a> and <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. <a href="Megara">Megara</a> deserted the Spartan-led <a href="Peloponnesian%20League">Peloponnesian League</a> and allied herself with Athens, allowing construction of a double line of walls across the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Corinth">Isthmus of Corinth</a> and protecting Athens from attack from that quarter. Around the same time, due to encouragement from influential speaker <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a>, the Athenians also constructed the <a href="Long%20Walls">Long Walls</a> connecting their city to the <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, its port, making it effectively invulnerable to attack by land.

In 454 BC, the Athenian general <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> moved the Delian League's treasury from Delos to Athens, allegedly to keep it safe from Persia. However, <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> indicates that many of Pericles' rivals viewed the transfer to Athens as usurping monetary resources to fund elaborate building projects. Athens also switched from accepting ships, men and weapons as dues from league members, to only accepting money.

The new treasury established in Athens was used for many purposes, not all relating to the defence of members of the league. It was from tribute paid to the league that Pericles set to building the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> on the <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis</a>, replacing an older temple, as well as many other non-defense related expenditures. The Delian League was turning from an alliance into an empire.

War with the Persians continued. In 460 BC, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> revolted under local leaders the Hellenes called <a href="Inaros">Inaros</a> and <a href="Amyrtaeus">Amyrtaeus</a>, who requested aid from Athens. Pericles led 250 ships, intended to attack <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, to their aid because it would further damage Persia. After four years, however, the Egyptian rebellion was defeated by the Achaemenid general <a href="Megabyzus">Megabyzus</a>, who captured the greater part of the Athenian forces. In fact, according to Isocrates, the Athenians and their allies lost some 20,000 men in the expedition. The remainder escaped to <a href="Cyrene%2C%20Libya">Cyrene</a> and thence returned home.

This was the Athenians' main (public) reason for moving the treasury of the League from Delos to Athens, further consolidating their control over the League. The Persians followed up their victory by sending a fleet to re-establish their control over <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, and 200 ships were sent out to counter them under <a href="Cimon">Cimon</a>, who returned from <a href="ostracism">ostracism</a> in 451 BC. He died during the blockade of <a href="Citium">Citium</a>, though the fleet won a double victory by land and sea over the Persians off <a href="Salamis%2C%20Cyprus">Salamis, Cyprus</a>.

This battle was the last major one fought against the Persians. Many writers report that a peace treaty, known as the <a href="Peace%20of%20Callias">Peace of Callias</a>, was formalized in 450 BC, but some writers believe that the treaty was a myth created later to inflate the stature of Athens. However, an understanding was definitely reached, enabling the Athenians to focus their attention on events in Greece proper.

Soon, <a href="First%20Peloponnesian%20War">war with the Peloponnesians</a> broke out. In 458 BC, the Athenians blockaded the island of <a href="Aegina">Aegina</a>, and simultaneously defended Megara from the Corinthians by sending out an army composed of those too young or old for regular military service. The following year, Sparta sent an army into <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>, reviving the power of <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a> in order to help hold the Athenians in check. Their return was blocked, and they resolved to march on Athens, where the Long Walls were not yet completed, winning a victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tanagra%20%28457%20BC%29">Battle of Tanagra</a>. All this accomplished, however, was to allow them to return home via the Megarid. Two months later, the Athenians under <a href="Myronides">Myronides</a> invaded Boeotia, and winning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Oenophyta">Battle of Oenophyta</a> gained control of the whole country except Thebes.

Reverses followed peace with Persia in 449 BC. The <a href="battle%20of%20Coronea%20%28447%20BC%29">Battle of Coronea</a>, in 447 BC, led to the abandonment of Boeotia. <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> and Megara revolted, and while the former was restored to its status as a tributary ally, the latter was a permanent loss. The Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues signed a peace treaty, which was set to endure for thirty years. It only lasted until 431 BC, when the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> broke out.

Those who revolted unsuccessfully during the war saw the example made of the <a href="Mytilene">Mytilenians</a>, the principal people on <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a>. After an unsuccessful revolt, the Athenians ordered the death of the entire male population. After some thought, they rescinded this order, and only put to death the leading 1000 ringleaders of the revolt, and redistributed the land of the entire island to Athenian shareholders, who were sent out to reside on Lesbos.

This type of treatment was not reserved solely for those who revolted. Thucydides documents the example of <a href="Melos">Melos</a>, a small island, neutral in the war, though founded by Spartans. The Melians were offered a choice to join the Athenians, or be conquered. Choosing to resist, their town was besieged and conquered; the males were put to death and the women sold into slavery (see <a href="Melian%20dialogue">Melian dialogue</a>).

By 454, the Delian League could be fairly characterized as an Athenian Empire; at the start of the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>, only <a href="Chios">Chios</a> and <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a> were left to contribute ships, and these states were by now far too weak to secede without support. Lesbos tried to revolt first, and failed completely. Chios, the most powerful of the original members of the Delian League save Athens, was the last to revolt, and in the aftermath of the <a href="Syracusan%20Expedition">Syracusan Expedition</a> enjoyed success for several years, inspiring all of <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a> to revolt. Athens was nonetheless eventually able to suppress these revolts.

To further strengthen Athens' grip on its empire, Pericles in 450 BC began a policy of establishing "<a href="Cleruchy">kleruchiai</a>"—quasi-colonies that remained tied to Athens and which served as garrisons to maintain control of the League's vast territory. Furthermore, Pericles employed a number of offices to maintain Athens' empire: "<a href="proxeny">proxenoi</a>", who fostered good relations between Athens and League members; "episkopoi" and "<a href="archont">archont</a>es", who oversaw the collection of tribute; and "<a href="hellenotamiai">hellenotamiai</a>", who received the tribute on Athens' behalf.

Athens' empire was not very stable and after 27 years of war, the Spartans, aided by the Persians and Athenian internal strife, were able to defeat it. However it did not remain defeated for long. The <a href="Second%20Athenian%20Empire">Second Athenian Empire</a>, a maritime self-defense league, was founded in 377 BC and was led by Athens. Athens would never recover the full extent of their power, and their enemies were now far stronger and more varied.

August Horch

August Horch (12 October 1868 – 3 February 1951) was a <a href="Germans">German</a> <a href="engineer">engineer</a> and <a href="automobile">automobile</a> <a href="Innovator">pioneer</a>, the founder of the manufacturing giant which would eventually become <a href="Audi">Audi</a>.

Horch was born in <a href="Winningen">Winningen</a>, <a href="Rhenish%20Prussia">Rhenish Prussia</a>. His initial trade was as a blacksmith, and then was educated at <a href="Hochschule%20Mittweida">Hochschule Mittweida</a> (Mittweida Technical College). After receiving a degree in engineering, he worked in shipbuilding. Horch worked for <a href="Karl%20Benz">Karl Benz</a> from 1896, before founding "<a href="Horch">A. Horch & Co.</a>" in November 1899, in <a href="Ehrenfeld%2C%20Cologne">Ehrenfeld, Cologne</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>.

The first <a href="Horch">Horch</a> automobile was built in 1901. The company moved to <a href="Reichenbach%20im%20Vogtland">Reichenbach</a> in 1902 and <a href="Zwickau">Zwickau</a> in 1904. Horch left the company in 1909 after a dispute, and set up in competition in Zwickau. His new firm was initially called "Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH", but following a legal dispute over the "Horch" name, he decided to make another automobile company. (The court decided that "Horch" was a registered trademark on behalf of August Horch's former partners and August Horch was not entitled to use it any more). Consequently, Horch named his new company "<a href="Audi%20Automobilwerke%20GmbH">Audi Automobilwerke GmbH</a>" in 1910, "Audi" being the Latinization of Horch.

Horch left Audi in 1920 and went to Berlin and took various jobs. He published his autobiography, "I Built Cars (Ich Baute Autos)" in 1937. He also served on the board of Auto Union, the successor to Audi Automobilwerke GmbH. He was an honorary citizen of Zwickau and had a street named for his Audi cars in both Zwickau and his birthplace Winningen. He was made an honorary professor at <a href="Braunschweig%20University%20of%20Technology">Braunschweig University of Technology</a>.
After the war, there were left-wing circles who vilified August Horch, claiming he was a Nazi, and argued that his honorary citizenship of the city of Zwickau should be withdrawn. Horch was not a member of the <a href="Nazi%20party">Nazi party</a>, nor did he have influence on the production of armaments, so the City Council did not comply with the request.
In early July 1945, Horch moved to <a href="Upper%20Franconia">Upper Franconia</a>, where he and his housekeeper and foster daughter Else Kolmar first found an accommodation in Helmbrechts and three months later in Münchberg. The wife of Horch wife died on March 26, 1946, at a nursing home in Berlin, a few days later his son Eberhard. In the summer of 1948, Horch and Else Kolmar, who came from a Jewish family, married.

<doc id="2039" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2039" title="Avionics">
Avionics

Avionics are the <a href="Electronics">electronic</a> systems used on aircraft, <a href="artificial%20satellite">artificial satellite</a>s, and <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a>. Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions. These can be as simple as a <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a> for a <a href="police%20helicopter">police helicopter</a> or as complicated as the tactical system for an <a href="airborne%20early%20warning">airborne early warning</a> platform. The term "avionics" is a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of the words "aviation" and "electronics".

The term "avionics" was coined by the journalist <a href="Philip%20J.%20Klass">Philip J. Klass</a> as a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "aviation electronics". Many modern avionics have their origins in <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a> wartime developments. For example, <a href="autopilot">autopilot</a> systems that are prolific today were started to help bomber planes fly steadily enough to hit precision targets from high altitudes. Famously, radar was developed in the UK, Germany, and the United States during the same period. Modern avionics is a substantial portion of military aircraft spending. Aircraft like the <a href="F-15E">F‑15E</a> and the now retired <a href="F-14">F‑14</a> have roughly 20 percent of their budget spent on avionics. Most modern <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s now have budget splits of 60/40 in favour of avionics. 

The civilian market has also seen a growth in cost of avionics. Flight control systems (<a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a>) and new navigation needs brought on by tighter airspaces, have pushed up development costs. The major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying. As more people begin to use planes as their primary method of transportation, more elaborate methods of controlling aircraft safely in these high restrictive airspaces have been invented.

Avionics plays a heavy role in modernization initiatives like the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a>'s (FAA) <a href="Next%20Generation%20Air%20Transportation%20System">Next Generation Air Transportation System</a> project in the United States and the <a href="Single%20European%20Sky%20ATM%20Research">Single European Sky ATM Research</a> (SESAR) initiative in Europe. The <a href="Joint%20Planning%20and%20Development%20Office">Joint Planning and Development Office</a> put forth a roadmap for avionics in six areas:

The cockpit of an aircraft is a typical location for avionic equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation, weather, and anti-collision systems. The majority of aircraft power their avionics using 14- or 28‑volt <a href="direct%20current">DC</a> electrical systems; however, larger, more sophisticated aircraft (such as <a href="airliner">airliner</a>s or military combat aircraft) have <a href="alternating%20current">AC</a> systems operating at 400 Hz, 115 volts AC. There are several major vendors of flight avionics, including <a href="Panasonic%20Avionics%20Corporation">Panasonic Avionics Corporation</a>, <a href="Honeywell%20Aerospace">Honeywell</a> (which now owns <a href="Bendix%20Aviation">Bendix/King</a>), <a href="Rockwell%20Collins">Rockwell Collins</a>, <a href="Thales%20Group">Thales Group</a>, <a href="GE%20Aviation%20Systems">GE Aviation Systems</a>, <a href="Garmin">Garmin</a>, <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a>, <a href="Parker%20Hannifin">Parker Hannifin</a>, <a href="UTC%20Aerospace%20Systems">UTC Aerospace Systems</a> and <a href="Avidyne%20Corporation">Avidyne Corporation</a>.

One source of international standards for avionics equipment are prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) and published by ARINC.

Communications connect the flight deck to the ground and the flight deck to the passengers. On‑board communications are provided by public-address systems and aircraft intercoms.

The VHF aviation communication system works on the <a href="airband">airband</a> of 118.000 MHz to 136.975 MHz. Each channel is spaced from the adjacent ones by 8.33 kHz in Europe, 25 kHz elsewhere. VHF is also used for line of sight communication such as aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-ATC. <a href="Amplitude%20modulation">Amplitude modulation</a> (AM) is used, and the conversation is performed in <a href="Simplex%20communication">simplex</a> mode. Aircraft communication can also take place using HF (especially for trans-oceanic flights) or satellite communication.

<a href="Radio%20navigation">Navigation</a> is the determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the Earth. Avionics can use satellite-based systems (such as <a href="GPS">GPS</a> and <a href="WAAS">WAAS</a>), ground-based systems (such as <a href="VHF%20omnidirectional%20range">VOR</a> or <a href="LORAN">LORAN</a>), or any combination thereof. Navigation systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays. Older avionics required a pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on a paper map to determine an aircraft's location; modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays.

 The first hints of <a href="glass%20cockpit">glass cockpit</a>s emerged in the 1970s when flight-worthy <a href="cathode%20ray%20tube">cathode ray tube</a> (CRT) screens began to replace electromechanical displays, gauges and instruments. A "glass" cockpit refers to the use of computer monitors instead of gauges and other analog displays. Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls.

Glass cockpits started to come into being with the <a href="Gulfstream%20Aerospace">Gulfstream</a> G‑IV private jet in 1985. One of the key challenges in glass cockpits is to balance how much control is automated and how much the pilot should do manually. Generally they try to automate flight operations while keeping the pilot constantly informed.

Aircraft have means of automatically controlling flight. <a href="Autopilot">Autopilot</a> was first invented by <a href="Lawrence%20Sperry">Lawrence Sperry</a> during <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a> to fly bomber planes steady enough to hit accurate targets from 25,000 feet. When it was first adopted by the <a href="U.S.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmilitary">U.S. military</a>, a <a href="Honeywell%20Aerospace">Honeywell</a> engineer sat in the back seat with bolt cutters to disconnect the autopilot in case of emergency. Nowadays most commercial planes are equipped with aircraft flight control systems in order to reduce pilot error and workload at landing or takeoff.

The first simple commercial auto-pilots were used to control <a href="Aircraft%20heading">heading</a> and altitude and had limited authority on things like <a href="thrust">thrust</a> and <a href="flight%20control">flight control</a> surfaces. In <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s, auto-stabilization was used in a similar way. The first systems were electromechanical. The advent of <a href="fly%20by%20wire">fly by wire</a> and electro-actuated flight surfaces (rather than the traditional hydraulic) has increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices that were electro-mechanical had a finite life. With safety critical systems, the software is very strictly tested.

To supplement <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a>, most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a <a href="TCAS">traffic alert and collision avoidance system</a> (TCAS), which can detect the location of nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the <a href="transponder">transponder</a>s of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.

To help avoid controlled flight into terrain (<a href="CFIT">CFIT</a>), aircraft use systems such as <a href="GPWS">ground-proximity warning systems</a> (GPWS), which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of GPWS is the lack of "look-ahead" information, because it only provides altitude above terrain "look-down". In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use a terrain awareness warning system (<a href="TAWS">TAWS</a>).

Commercial aircraft cockpit data recorders, commonly known as a "black box", store flight information and audio from the <a href="cockpit">cockpit</a>. They are often recovered from a plane after a crash to determine control settings and other parameters during the incident.

Weather systems such as <a href="weather%20radar">weather radar</a> (typically <a href="Arinc%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B708">Arinc 708</a> on commercial aircraft) and <a href="lightning%20detector">lightning detector</a>s are important for aircraft flying at night or in <a href="instrument%20meteorological%20conditions">instrument meteorological conditions</a>, where it is not possible for pilots to see the weather ahead. Heavy precipitation (as sensed by radar) or severe <a href="Clear-air%20turbulence">turbulence</a> (as sensed by lightning activity) are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas.

Lightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. In addition to radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures (such as <a href="NEXRAD">NEXRAD</a>) are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems. Modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, and traffic onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.

Modern weather systems also include <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> and turbulence detection and terrain and traffic warning systems. In‑plane weather avionics are especially popular in Africa, <a href="India">India</a>, and other countries where air-travel is a growing market, but ground support is not as well developed.

There has been a progression towards centralized control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft, including engine monitoring and management. <a href="Health%20and%20usage%20monitoring%20systems">Health and usage monitoring systems</a> (HUMS) are integrated with aircraft management computers to give maintainers early warnings of parts that will need replacement.

The <a href="integrated%20modular%20avionics">integrated modular avionics</a> concept proposes an integrated architecture with application software portable across an assembly of common hardware modules. It has been used in <a href="fourth%20generation%20jet%20fighter">fourth generation jet fighter</a>s and the latest generation of <a href="airliner">airliner</a>s.

<a href="Military%20aircraft">Military aircraft</a> have been designed either to deliver a weapon or to be the eyes and ears of other weapon systems. The vast array of sensors available to the military is used for whatever tactical means required. As with aircraft management, the bigger sensor platforms (like the E‑3D, JSTARS, ASTOR, Nimrod MRA4, Merlin HM Mk 1) have mission-management computers.

Police and EMS aircraft also carry sophisticated tactical sensors.

While aircraft communications provide the backbone for safe flight, the tactical systems are designed to withstand the rigors of the battle field. <a href="Ultra%20high%20frequency">UHF</a>, <a href="Very%20high%20frequency">VHF</a> Tactical (30–88 MHz) and SatCom systems combined with <a href="Electronic%20counter-countermeasures">ECCM</a> methods, and <a href="cryptography">cryptography</a> secure the communications. Data links such as <a href="Link%2011">Link 11</a>, <a href="Link%2016">16</a>, <a href="Link%2022">22</a> and <a href="Bowman%20%28communications%20system%29">BOWMAN</a>, <a href="JTRS">JTRS</a> and even <a href="TETRA">TETRA</a> provide the means of transmitting data (such as images, targeting information etc.).

Airborne <a href="radar">radar</a> was one of the first tactical sensors. The benefit of altitude providing range has meant a significant focus on airborne radar technologies. Radars include <a href="airborne%20early%20warning">airborne early warning</a> (AEW), <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a> (ASW), and even <a href="weather%20radar">weather radar</a> (<a href="Arinc%20708">Arinc 708</a>) and ground tracking/proximity radar.

The military uses <a href="Terrain-following%20radar">radar in fast jets to help pilots fly at low levels</a>. While the civil market has had weather radar for a while, there are strict rules about using it to navigate the aircraft.

Dipping sonar fitted to a range of military helicopters allows the <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a> to protect shipping assets from submarines or surface threats. Maritime support aircraft can drop active and passive sonar devices (<a href="sonobuoy">sonobuoy</a>s) and these are also used to determine the location of hostile <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s.

Electro-optic systems include devices such as the <a href="head-up%20display">head-up display</a> (HUD), <a href="forward%20looking%20infrared">forward looking infrared</a> (FLIR), <a href="infra-red%20search%20and%20track">infra-red search and track</a> and other passive infrared devices (<a href="Passive%20infrared%20sensor">Passive infrared sensor</a>). These are all used to provide imagery and information to the flight crew. This imagery is used for everything from search and rescue to <a href="navigational%20aid">navigational aid</a>s and <a href="target%20acquisition">target acquisition</a>.

Electronic support measures and defensive aids are used extensively to gather information about threats or possible threats. They can be used to launch devices (in some cases automatically) to counter direct threats against the aircraft. They are also used to determine the state of a threat and identify it.

The avionics systems in military, commercial and advanced models of civilian aircraft are interconnected using an avionics databus. Common avionics databus protocols, with their primary application, include:

<doc id="2041" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2041" title="Ares">
Ares

Ares (; ) is the <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20figures">Greek god</a> <a href="war%20god">of war</a>. He is one of the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Twelve Olympians</a>, and the son of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Hera">Hera</a>. In <a href="ancient%20Greek%20literature">Greek literature</a>, he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war, in contrast to his sister the armored <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, whose functions as a <a href="knowledge%20deity">goddess of intelligence</a> include <a href="military%20strategy">military strategy</a> and <a href="general%20officer">generalship</a>.

The Greeks were toward Ares: although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war, he was a dangerous force, "overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering." His sons <a href="Phobos%20%28mythology%29">Phobos</a> (Fear) and <a href="Deimos%20%28mythology%29">Deimos</a> (Terror) and his lover, or sister, <a href="Enyo">Enyo</a> (Discord) accompanied him on his war <a href="chariot">chariot</a>. In the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>," his father Zeus tells him that he is the god most hateful to him. An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality. His value as a war god is placed in doubt: during the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>, Ares was on the losing side, while Athena, often depicted in <a href="ancient%20Greek%20art">Greek art</a> as holding <a href="Nike%20%28mythology%29">Nike (Victory)</a> in her hand, favoured the triumphant Greeks.

Ares plays a relatively limited role in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> as represented in literary narratives, though his numerous love affairs and abundant offspring are often <a href="allusion">alluded</a> to. When Ares does appear in myths, he typically faces humiliation. He is well known as the lover of <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, the goddess of love, who was married to <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>, god of craftsmanship. The most famous story related to Ares and Aphrodite shows them exposed to ridicule through the wronged husband's device.

The counterpart of Ares among the <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20deities">Roman gods</a> is <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a>, who as a father of the Roman people was given a more important and dignified place in <a href="Religion%20in%20ancient%20Rome">ancient Roman religion</a> as a <a href="tutelary%20deity">guardian deity</a>. During the <a href="Hellenization">Hellenization</a> of <a href="Latin%20literature">Latin literature</a>, the myths of Ares were <a href="interpretatio%20graeca">reinterpreted</a> by Roman writers under the name of Mars. Greek writers under <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman rule</a> also recorded <a href="cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult practices</a> and beliefs pertaining to Mars under the name of Ares. Thus in the <a href="classical%20mythology">classical tradition</a> of later <a href="Western%20culture">Western art and literature</a>, the mythology of the two figures becomes virtually indistinguishable.

The etymology of the name "Ares" is traditionally connected with the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word ("arē"), the <a href="Ionic%20Greek">Ionic</a> form of the <a href="Doric%20Greek">Doric</a> ("ara"), "bane, ruin, curse, imprecation". There may also be a connection with the Roman god of war, <a href="Mars%20%28god%29">Mars</a>, via hypothetical <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> *"M̥rēs"; compare Ancient Greek μάρναμαι ("marnamai"), "I fight, I battle". <a href="Walter%20Burkert">Walter Burkert</a> notes that "Ares is apparently an ancient abstract noun meaning throng of battle, war." <a href="Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes">R. S. P. Beekes</a> has suggested a <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> origin of the name.

The earliest attested form of the name is the <a href="Mycenaean%20language">Mycenaean Greek</a> , "a-re", written in the <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> syllabic script.

The <a href="adjective">adjectival</a> <a href="epithet">epithet</a>, "Areios," was frequently appended to the names of other gods when they took on a warrior aspect or became involved in warfare: "Zeus Areios", "Athena Areia", even "Aphrodite Areia". In the "Iliad", the word "ares" is used as a <a href="common%20noun">common noun</a> synonymous with "battle."

Inscriptions as early as <a href="Helladic%20period">Mycenaean</a> times, and continuing into the <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical period</a>, attest to <a href="Enyalios">Enyalios</a> as another name for the god of war.

Ares was one of the Twelve Olympians in the archaic tradition represented by the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" and "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>." Zeus expresses a recurring Greek revulsion toward the god when Ares returns wounded and complaining from the <a href="Trojan%20War">battlefield at Troy</a>:
Then looking at him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:<br>"Do not sit beside me and whine, you double-faced liar.<br>To me you are the most hateful of all gods who hold Olympus.<br>Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, wars and battles.<br>…<br>And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, since<br>you are my child, and it was to me that your mother bore you.<br>But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinous<br>long since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky."
This ambivalence is expressed also in the Greeks' association of the god with the <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a>, whom they regarded as a barbarous and warlike people. <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> was Ares's birthplace, his true home, and his refuge after the affair with Aphrodite was exposed to the general mockery of the other gods.

A late-6th-century BC funerary inscription from <a href="Attica">Attica</a> emphasizes the consequences of coming under Ares's sway:
Stay and mourn at the tomb of dead Kroisos<br>Whom raging Ares destroyed one day, fighting in the foremost ranks.
In <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, Ares was viewed as a model soldier: his resilience, physical strength, and military intelligence were unrivaled. An ancient statue, representing the god in chains, suggests that the martial spirit and victory were to be kept in the city of Sparta. That the Spartans admired him is indicative of the cultural divisions that existed between themselves and other Greeks, especially the Athenians (see <a href="Pelopponesian%20War">Pelopponesian War</a>).

Ares was also worshipped by the inhabitants of <a href="Tylos">Tylos</a>. It is not known if he was worshipped in the form of an Arabian god (or which one) or if he was worshipped in his Greek form.

The birds of Ares ("Ornithes Areioi") were a flock of feather-dart-dropping birds that guarded the <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a>' shrine of the god on a <a href="coast">coast</a>al <a href="island">island</a> in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>.

Although Ares received occasional sacrifice from armies going to war, the god had a formal temple and cult at only a few sites. At <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, however, each company of youths sacrificed a puppy to <a href="Enyalios">Enyalios</a> before engaging in ritual fighting at the Phoebaeum. The <a href="chthonic">chthonic</a> night-time sacrifice of a dog to Enyalios became assimilated to the cult of Ares.

Just east of Sparta stood an archaic statue of the god in chains, to show that the spirit of war and victory was to be kept in the city.

The <a href="Temple%20of%20Ares">Temple of Ares</a> in the <a href="Ancient%20Agora%20of%20Athens">agora</a> of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, which <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> saw in the second century AD, had been moved and rededicated there during the time of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>. Essentially it was a <a href="Roman%20temple">Roman temple</a> to the Augustan <a href="Mars%20Ultor">Mars Ultor</a>. From archaic times, the <a href="Areopagus">Areopagus</a>, the "mount of Ares" at some distance from the Acropolis, was a site of trials. <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a> later preached about Christianity there. Its connection with Ares, perhaps based on a false etymology, is <a href="Etiology">etiological myth</a>. A second temple to Ares has been located at the archaeological site of <a href="Metropolis%20%28Anatolia%29">Metropolis</a> in what is now Western <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>.

<a href="Deimos%20%28mythology%29">Deimos</a>, "Terror" or "Dread", and <a href="Phobos%20%28mythology%29">Phobos</a>, "Fear" or "Horror", are his companions in war. According to <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>, they were also his children, borne by <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>. <a href="Eris%20%28mythology%29">Eris</a>, the goddess of discord, or <a href="Enyo">Enyo</a>, the goddess of war, bloodshed, and violence, was considered the sister and companion of the violent Ares. In at least one tradition, Enyalius, rather than another name for Ares, was his son by Enyo.

Ares may also be accompanied by <a href="Kydoimos">Kydoimos</a>, the demon of the din of battle; the <a href="Makhai">Makhai</a> ("Battles"); the "Hysminai" ("Acts of manslaughter"); <a href="Polemos">Polemos</a>, a minor spirit of war, or only an epithet of Ares, since it has no specific dominion; and Polemos's daughter, <a href="Alala">Alala</a>, the <a href="goddess">goddess</a> or <a href="personification">personification</a> of the Greek war-cry, whose name Ares uses as his own war-cry. Ares's sister <a href="Hebe%20%28mythology%29">Hebe</a> ("Youth") also draws baths for him.

According to <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, local inhabitants of <a href="Therapne">Therapne</a>, <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, recognized <a href="Thero%20%28Greek%20mythology%29">Thero</a>, "feral, savage," as a nurse of Ares.

One of the roles of Ares was expressed in mainland Greece as the <a href="founding%20myth">founding myth</a> of Thebes: Ares was the progenitor of the water-dragon slain by <a href="Cadmus">Cadmus</a>, for the dragon's teeth were sown into the ground as if a crop and sprang up as the fully armored <a href="indigenous%20peoples">autochthon</a>ic <a href="Spartoi">Spartoi</a>. To propitiate Ares, Cadmus took as a bride <a href="Harmonia%20%28mythology%29">Harmonia</a>, a daughter of Ares's union with Aphrodite. In this way, Cadmus harmonized all strife and founded the city of Thebes.

The union of Ares and Aphrodite created the gods <a href="Eros">Eros</a>, <a href="Anteros">Anteros</a>, <a href="Phobos%20%28mythology%29">Phobos</a>, <a href="Deimos%20%28mythology%29">Deimos</a>, <a href="Harmonia%20%28mythology%29">Harmonia</a>, and <a href="Adrestia">Adrestia</a>. While Eros's and Anteros's godly stations favored their mother, Adrestia preferred to emulate her father, often accompanying him to war. Other versions include Alcippe as one of his daughters.

Upon one occasion, Ares incurred the anger of <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> by slaying his son, <a href="Halirrhothius">Halirrhothius</a>, because he had raped Alcippe, a daughter of the war-god. For this deed, Poseidon summoned Ares to appear before the tribunal of the Olympic gods, which was held upon a hill in Athens. Ares was acquitted. This event is supposed to have given rise to the name <a href="Areopagus">Areopagus</a> (or Hill of Ares), which afterward became famous as the site of a court of justice.

Accounts tell of <a href="Cycnus">Cycnus</a> (Κύκνος) of <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, a son of Ares who was so murderous that he tried to build a temple with the skulls and the bones of travellers. <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> slaughtered this abominable monstrosity, engendering the wrath of Ares, whom the hero wounded in conflict.



In the tale sung by the bard in the hall of <a href="Alcinous">Alcinous</a>, the Sun-god <a href="Helios">Helios</a> once spied Ares and Aphrodite enjoying each other secretly in the hall of <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>, her husband. He reported the incident to Hephaestus. Contriving to catch the illicit couple in the act, Hephaestus fashioned a finely-knitted and nearly invisible net with which to snare them. At the appropriate time, this net was sprung, and trapped Ares and Aphrodite locked in very private embrace.

But Hephaestus was not satisfied with his revenge, so he invited the Olympian gods and goddesses to view the unfortunate pair. For the sake of modesty, the goddesses demurred, but the male gods went to witness the sight. Some commented on the beauty of Aphrodite, others remarked that they would eagerly trade places with Ares, but all who were present mocked the two. Once the couple was released, the embarrassed Ares returned to his homeland, Thrace, and Aphrodite went to Paphos.

In a much later interpolated detail, Ares put the young soldier <a href="Alectryon%20%28mythology%29">Alectryon</a> by his door to warn them of Helios's arrival as Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite's infidelity if the two were discovered, but Alectryon fell asleep on guard duty. Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus. The furious Ares turned the sleepy Alectryon into a <a href="rooster">rooster</a> which now always announces the arrival of the sun in the morning.

In one archaic myth, related only in the "Iliad" by the goddess <a href="Dione%20%28mythology%29">Dione</a> to her daughter Aphrodite, two chthonic giants, the <a href="Aloadae">Aloadae</a>, named Otus and Ephialtes, threw Ares into chains and put him in a bronze urn, where he remained for thirteen months, a <a href="lunar%20year">lunar year</a>. "And that would have been the end of Ares and his appetite for war, if the beautiful Eriboea, the young giants' stepmother, had not told <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> what they had done," she related. "In this one suspects a festival of licence which is unleashed in the thirteenth month."

Ares was held screaming and howling in the urn until Hermes rescued him, and <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> tricked the Aloadae into slaying each other. In <a href="Nonnus">Nonnus</a>'s "<a href="Dionysiaca">Dionysiaca</a>" Ares also killed Ekhidnades, the giant son of <a href="Echidna%20%28mythology%29">Echidna</a>, and a great enemy of the gods. Scholars have not concluded whether the nameless Ekhidnades ("of Echidna's lineage") was entirely Nonnus's invention or not. 

In the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", <a href="Homer">Homer</a> represented Ares as having no fixed allegiances, rewarding courage on both sides: he promised Athena and Hera that he would fight on the side of the <a href="Achaeans%20%28Homer%29">Achaeans</a> ("Iliad" V.830–834, XXI.410–414), but <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> persuaded Ares to side with the <a href="Troy">Trojans</a>. During the war, <a href="Diomedes">Diomedes</a> fought with <a href="Hector">Hector</a> and saw Ares fighting on the Trojans' side. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly (V.590–605).

Athene or Athena, Ares's sister, saw his interference and asked Zeus, his father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield, which Zeus granted (V.711–769). Hera and Athena encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares (V.780–834). Diomedes thrust with his spear at Ares, with Athena driving it home, and Ares's cries made Achaeans and Trojans alike tremble (V.855–864). Ares fled to <a href="Mt.%20Olympus">Mt. Olympus</a>, forcing the Trojans to fall back.

When Hera mentioned to <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> that Ares's son, Ascalaphus, was killed, Ares overheard and wanted to join the fight on the side of the Achaeans, disregarding Zeus's order that no Olympic god should enter the battle, but Athena stopped him (XV.110–128). Later, when Zeus allowed the gods to fight in the war again (XX.20–29), Ares was the first to act, attacking Athena to avenge himself for his previous injury. Athena overpowered him by striking Ares with a boulder (XXI.391–408).

In <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> works of art, Ares's symbols are a spear and helmet, his animal is a dog, and his bird is the <a href="vulture">vulture</a>. In literary works of these eras, Ares is replaced by the Roman Mars, a romantic emblem of manly valor rather than the cruel and blood-thirsty god of Greek mythology.

Ares figures in war-themed <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s and in popular fictions.

<a href="NASA">NASA</a> named their transport ship as "Ares", which replaced the <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a>. This was an extension of NASA's practice of using Roman and Greek names for their rockets and programs: <a href="Saturn%20%28rocket%20family%29">"Saturn" for manned rockets</a>, <a href="Mercury%20%28satellite%29">"Mercury" for a satellite program</a>, and the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>, rather than any association with the nature of the war god.

Alexander Grothendieck

Alexander Grothendieck (; ; ; 28 March 1928 – 13 November 2014) was a German-born French <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> who became the leading figure in the creation of modern <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>. His research extended the scope of the field and added elements of <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a>, <a href="homological%20algebra">homological algebra</a>, <a href="sheaf%20theory">sheaf theory</a> and <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a> to its foundations, while his so-called <a href="Grothendieck%27s%20relative%20point%20of%20view">"relative" perspective</a> led to revolutionary advances in many areas of <a href="pure%20mathematics">pure mathematics</a>. He is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century.

Born in Germany, Grothendieck was raised and lived primarily in France. For much of his working life, however, he was, in effect, <a href="Statelessness">stateless</a>. As he consistently spelled his first name "Alexander" rather than "Alexandre" and his surname, taken from his mother, was the Dutch-like <a href="Low%20German">Low German</a> "Grothendieck," he was sometimes mistakenly believed to be of Dutch origin.

Grothendieck began his productive and public career as a mathematician in 1949. In 1958, he was appointed a research professor at the <a href="Institut%20des%20Hautes%20%C3%89tudes%20Scientifiques">Institut des hautes études scientifiques</a> (IHÉS) and remained there until 1970, when, driven by personal and political convictions, he left following a dispute over military funding. He later became professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Montpellier">University of Montpellier</a> and, while still producing relevant mathematical work, he withdrew from the mathematical community and devoted himself to political causes. Soon after his formal retirement in 1988, he moved to the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, where he lived in isolation until his death in 2014.

Grothendieck was born in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> to <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a> parents. His father, <a href="Sascha%20Schapiro">Alexander "Sascha" Schapiro</a> (also known as Alexander Tanaroff), had <a href="Hassidic">Hassidic</a> roots and had been imprisoned in Russia before moving to Germany in 1922, while his mother, Johanna "Hanka" Grothendieck, came from a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> family in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and worked as a journalist. Both had broken away from their early backgrounds in their teens. At the time of his birth, Grothendieck's mother was married to the journalist Johannes Raddatz and his birthname was initially recorded as "Alexander Raddatz." The marriage was dissolved in 1929 and Schapiro/Tanaroff acknowledged his paternity, but never married Hanka.

Grothendieck lived with his parents in Berlin until the end of 1933, when his father moved to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to evade <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>, followed soon thereafter by his mother. They left Grothendieck in the care of Wilhelm Heydorn, a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> <a href="pastor">pastor</a> and teacher in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. During this time, his parents took part in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, according to , as non-combatant auxiliaries, though others state that Sascha fought in the anarchist militia.

In May 1939, Grothendieck was put on a train in Hamburg for France. Shortly afterwards his father was interned in <a href="Camp%20Vernet">Le Vernet</a>. He and his mother were then interned in various camps from 1940 to 1942 as "undesirable dangerous foreigners". The first was the , where his mother contracted the tuberculosis which eventually caused her death and where Alexander managed to attend the local school, at <a href="Mende%2C%20Loz%C3%A8re">Mende</a>. Once Alexander managed to escape from the camp, intending to assassinate Hitler. Later, his mother Hanka was transferred to the <a href="Gurs%20internment%20camp">Gurs internment camp</a> for the remainder of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Alexander was permitted to live, separated from his mother, in the village of <a href="Le%20Chambon-sur-Lignon">Le Chambon-sur-Lignon</a>, sheltered and hidden in local boarding houses or <a href="Pension%20%28lodging%29">pension</a>s, though he occasionally had to seek refuge in the woods during Nazis raids, surviving at times without food or water for several days. His father was arrested under the <a href="Vichy%20anti-Jewish%20legislation">Vichy anti-Jewish legislation</a>, and sent to the <a href="Drancy%20internment%20camp">Drancy</a>, and then handed over by the <a href="Vichy%20France">French Vichy government</a> to the Germans to be sent to be murdered at the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> in 1942. In Chambon, Grothendieck attended the Collège Cévenol (now known as the <a href="Le%20Coll%C3%A8ge-Lyc%C3%A9e%20C%C3%A9venol%20International">Le Collège-Lycée Cévenol International</a>), a unique secondary school founded in 1938 by local Protestant pacifists and anti-war activists. Many of the refugee children hidden in Chambon attended Cévenol, and it was at this school that Grothendieck apparently first became fascinated with mathematics.

After the war, the young Grothendieck studied mathematics in France, initially at the <a href="University%20of%20Montpellier">University of Montpellier</a> where he did not initially perform well, failing such classes as astronomy. Working on his own, he rediscovered the <a href="Lebesgue%20measure">Lebesgue measure</a>. After three years of increasingly independent studies there, he went to continue his studies in Paris in 1948.

Initially, Grothendieck attended <a href="Henri%20Cartan">Henri Cartan</a>'s Seminar at <a href="%C3%89cole%20Normale%20Sup%C3%A9rieure">École Normale Supérieure</a>, but he lacked the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Weil">André Weil</a>, he moved to the <a href="University%20of%20Nancy">University of Nancy</a> where he wrote his dissertation under <a href="Laurent%20Schwartz">Laurent Schwartz</a> and <a href="Jean%20Dieudonn%C3%A9">Jean Dieudonné</a> on <a href="functional%20analysis">functional analysis</a>, from 1950 to 1953. At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of <a href="topological%20vector%20space">topological vector space</a>s. By 1957, he set this subject aside in order to work in algebraic geometry and <a href="homological%20algebra">homological algebra</a>. The same year he was invited to visit Harvard by <a href="Oscar%20Zariski">Oscar Zariski</a>, but the offer fell through when he refused to sign a pledge promising not to work to overthrow the United States government, a position that, he was warned, might have landed him in prison. The prospect did not worry him, as long as he could have access to books.

Comparing Grothendieck during his Nancy years to the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Normale%20Sup%C3%A9rieure">École Normale Supérieure</a> trained students at that time: <a href="Pierre%20Samuel">Pierre Samuel</a>, <a href="Roger%20Godement">Roger Godement</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Thom">René Thom</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Dixmier">Jacques Dixmier</a>, <a href="Jean%20Cerf">Jean Cerf</a>, <a href="Yvonne%20Bruhat">Yvonne Bruhat</a>, <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Malgrange">Bernard Malgrange</a>, <a href="Leila%20Schneps">Leila Schneps</a> says:

In 1958 Grothendieck was installed at the <a href="Institut%20des%20Hautes%20%C3%89tudes%20Scientifiques">Institut des hautes études scientifiques</a> (IHÉS), a new privately funded research institute that, in effect, had been created for <a href="Jean%20Dieudonn%C3%A9">Jean Dieudonné</a> and Grothendieck. Grothendieck attracted attention by an intense and highly productive activity of seminars there ("de facto" working groups drafting into foundational work some of the ablest French and other mathematicians of the younger generation). Grothendieck himself practically ceased publication of papers through the conventional, <a href="learned%20journal">learned journal</a> route. He was, however, able to play a dominant role in mathematics for around a decade, gathering a strong school.

During this time, he had officially as students <a href="Michel%20Demazure">Michel Demazure</a> (who worked on SGA3, on <a href="group%20scheme">group scheme</a>s), <a href="Luc%20Illusie">Luc Illusie</a> (cotangent complex), <a href="Michel%20Raynaud">Michel Raynaud</a>, <a href="Jean-Louis%20Verdier">Jean-Louis Verdier</a> (cofounder of the <a href="derived%20category">derived category</a> theory) and <a href="Pierre%20Deligne">Pierre Deligne</a>. Collaborators on the SGA projects also included <a href="Michael%20Artin">Michael Artin</a> (<a href="%C3%A9tale%20cohomology">étale cohomology</a>) and <a href="Nick%20Katz">Nick Katz</a> (<a href="monodromy%20theory">monodromy theory</a> and <a href="Lefschetz%20pencil">Lefschetz pencil</a>s). <a href="Jean%20Giraud%20%28mathematician%29">Jean Giraud</a> worked out <a href="torsor">torsor</a> theory extensions of <a href="nonabelian%20cohomology">nonabelian cohomology</a>. Many others were involved.

Alexander Grothendieck's work during the "Golden Age" period at the IHÉS established several unifying themes in <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>, <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>, <a href="topology">topology</a>, <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a> and <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a>. His first (pre-IHÉS) discovery in algebraic geometry was the <a href="Grothendieck%E2%80%93Hirzebruch%E2%80%93Riemann%E2%80%93Roch%20theorem">Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem</a>, a generalisation of the <a href="Hirzebruch%E2%80%93Riemann%E2%80%93Roch%20theorem">Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem</a> proved algebraically; in this context he also introduced <a href="K-theory">K-theory</a>. Then, following the programme he outlined in his talk at the 1958 <a href="International%20Congress%20of%20Mathematicians">International Congress of Mathematicians</a>, he introduced the theory of <a href="scheme%20%28mathematics%29">schemes</a>, developing it in detail in his "<a href="%C3%89l%C3%A9ments%20de%20g%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie%20alg%C3%A9brique">Éléments de géométrie algébrique</a>" ("EGA") and providing the new more flexible and general foundations for algebraic geometry that has been adopted in the field since that time. He went on to introduce the <a href="%C3%A9tale%20cohomology">étale cohomology</a> theory of schemes, providing the key tools for proving the <a href="Weil%20conjectures">Weil conjectures</a>, as well as <a href="crystalline%20cohomology">crystalline cohomology</a> and <a href="algebraic%20de%20Rham%20cohomology">algebraic de Rham cohomology</a> to complement it. Closely linked to these cohomology theories, he originated <a href="topos">topos</a> theory as a generalisation of topology (relevant also in <a href="categorical%20logic">categorical logic</a>). He also provided an algebraic definition of <a href="fundamental%20group">fundamental group</a>s of schemes and more generally the main structures of a categorical <a href="Galois%20theory">Galois theory</a>. As a framework for his <a href="coherent%20duality">coherent duality</a> theory he also introduced <a href="derived%20category">derived categories</a>, which were further developed by Verdier.

The results of work on these and other topics were published in the "EGA" and in less polished form in the notes of the "<a href="S%C3%A9minaire%20de%20g%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie%20alg%C3%A9brique">Séminaire de géométrie algébrique</a>" ("SGA") that he directed at the IHÉS.

Grothendieck's political views were <a href="Political%20radicalism">radical</a> and <a href="pacifist">pacifist</a>, and he strongly opposed both United States <a href="Vietnam%20War">intervention in Vietnam</a> and <a href="Soviet%20Empire">Soviet military expansionism</a>. He gave lectures on <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a> in the forests surrounding <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> while the city was being bombed, to protest against the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. He retired from scientific life around 1970, after having discovered that the IHÉS was partly funded by the military. He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Montpellier">University of Montpellier</a>.

While the issue of military funding was perhaps the most obvious explanation for Grothendieck's departure from the IHÉS, those who knew him say that the causes of the rupture ran deeper. <a href="Pierre%20Cartier%20%28mathematician%29">Pierre Cartier</a>, a "visiteur de longue durée" ("long-term guest") at the IHÉS, wrote a piece about Grothendieck for a special volume published on the occasion of the <a href="http%3A//www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf">IHÉS's fortieth anniversary</a>. The "Grothendieck Festschrift", published in 1990, was a three-volume collection of research papers to mark his sixtieth birthday in 1988.

In it, Cartier notes that as the son of an antimilitary anarchist and one who grew up among the disenfranchised, Grothendieck always had a deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden. As Cartier puts it, Grothendieck came to find <a href="Bures-sur-Yvette">Bures-sur-Yvette</a> ""une cage dorée"" ("a golden cage"). While Grothendieck was at the IHÉS, opposition to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> was heating up, and Cartier suggests that this also reinforced Grothendieck's distaste at having become a mandarin of the scientific world. In addition, after several years at the IHÉS, Grothendieck seemed to cast about for new intellectual interests. By the late 1960s, he had started to become interested in scientific areas outside mathematics. <a href="David%20Ruelle">David Ruelle</a>, a physicist who joined the IHÉS faculty in 1964, said that Grothendieck came to talk to him a few times about <a href="physics">physics</a>. <a href="Biology">Biology</a> interested Grothendieck much more than physics, and he organized some seminars on biological topics.

In 1970, Grothendieck, with two other mathematicians, <a href="Claude%20Chevalley">Claude Chevalley</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Samuel">Pierre Samuel</a>, created a political group called "Survivre"—the name later changed to "Survivre et vivre". The group published a bulletin and was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues, and also developed strong criticism of the indiscriminate use of science and technology. Grothendieck devoted the next three years to this group and served as the main editor of its bulletin.

After leaving the IHÉS, Grothendieck became a <a href="temporary%20professor">temporary professor</a> at <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France">Collège de France</a> for two years. He then became a professor at the University of Montpellier, where he became increasingly estranged from the mathematical community. His mathematical career, for the most part, ended when he left the IHÉS. He formally retired in 1988, a few years after having accepted a research position at the <a href="Centre%20National%20de%20la%20Recherche%20Scientifique">CNRS</a>.

While not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content.

Produced during 1980 and 1981, "La Longue Marche à travers la théorie de Galois" ("<a href="The%20Long%20March%20Through%20Galois%20Theory">The Long March Through Galois Theory</a>") is a 1600-page handwritten manuscript containing many of the ideas that led to the "<a href="Esquisse%20d%27un%20programme">Esquisse d'un programme</a>". It also includes a study of <a href="Teichm%C3%BCller%20space">Teichmüller theory</a>.

In 1983, stimulated by correspondence with <a href="Ronald%20Brown%20%28mathematician%29">Ronald Brown</a> and Tim Porter at <a href="Bangor%20University">Bangor University</a>, Grothendieck wrote a 600-page manuscript titled "<a href="Pursuing%20Stacks">Pursuing Stacks</a>", starting with a letter addressed to <a href="Daniel%20Quillen">Daniel Quillen</a>. This letter and successive parts were distributed from Bangor (see <a href="%23External%20links">External links</a> below). Within these, in an informal, diary-like manner, Grothendieck explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between <a href="algebraic%20homotopy%20theory">algebraic homotopy theory</a> and <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a> and prospects for a noncommutative theory of <a href="Stack%20%28mathematics%29">stack</a>s. The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works, "Les Dérivateurs". Written in 1991, this latter opus of about 2000 pages further developed the homotopical ideas begun in "Pursuing Stacks". Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development of the motivic homotopy theory of <a href="Fabien%20Morel">Fabien Morel</a> and <a href="V.%20Voevodsky">V. Voevodsky</a> in the mid-1990s.

In 1984, Grothendieck wrote the proposal "<a href="Esquisse%20d%27un%20Programme">Esquisse d'un Programme</a>" ("Sketch of a Programme") for a position at the <a href="Centre%20National%20de%20la%20Recherche%20Scientifique">Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</a> (CNRS). It describes new ideas for studying the <a href="moduli%20space">moduli space</a> of complex curves. Although Grothendieck himself never published his work in this area, the proposal inspired other mathematicians' work by becoming the source of <a href="dessin%20d%27enfant">dessin d'enfant</a> theory and <a href="Anabelian%20geometry">Anabelian geometry</a>. It was later published in the two-volume <a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DHlf1j2XmXkcC%26amp%3Bdq%3DGeometric%2BGalois%2BActions%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bsource%3Dbl%26amp%3Bots%3Dq9iN4QMkYj%26amp%3Bsig%3DfAsvVlPOhN9K9LfjGFJC5zm_IA4%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bei%3DKW-3ScSkHYHIMuDukOEK%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Boi%3Dbook_result%26amp%3Bresnum%3D1%26amp%3Bct%3Dresult">"Geometric Galois Actions"</a> (Cambridge University Press, 1997).

During this period, Grothendieck also gave his consent to publishing some of his drafts for EGA on <a href="Theorem%20of%20Bertini">Bertini-type theorem</a>s ("EGA" V, published in Ulam Quarterly in 1992-1993 and later made available on the <a href="http%3A//www.math.jussieu.fr/%7Eleila/grothendieckcircle/index.php">Grothendieck Circle</a> web site in 2004).

In the 1,000-page autobiographical manuscript "Récoltes et semailles" (1986) Grothendieck describes his approach to mathematics and his experiences in the mathematical community, a community that initially accepted him in an open and welcoming manner but which he progressively perceived to be governed by competition and status. He complains about what he saw as the "burial" of his work and betrayal by his former students and colleagues after he had left the community. "Récoltes et semailles" work is now available on the internet in the French original, and an English translation is underway. Parts of "Récoltes et semailles" have been translated into Spanish and into Russian and published in Moscow.

In 1988 Grothendieck declined the <a href="Crafoord%20Prize">Crafoord Prize</a> with an open letter to the media. He wrote that established mathematicians like himself had no need for additional financial support and criticized what he saw as the declining ethics of the scientific community, characterized by outright scientific theft that, according to him, had become commonplace and tolerated. The letter also expressed his belief that totally unforeseen events before the end of the century would lead to an unprecedented collapse of civilization. Grothendieck added however that his views are "in no way meant as a criticism of the Royal Academy's aims in the administration of its funds" and added "I regret the inconvenience that my refusal to accept the Crafoord prize may have caused you and the Royal Academy" and that he "apologized" for the inconvenience.

"La Clef des Songes", a 315-page manuscript written in 1987, is Grothendieck's account of how his consideration of the source of dreams led him to conclude that <a href="Existence%20of%20God">God exists</a>. As part of the notes to this manuscript, Grothendieck described the life and word of 18 "mutants," people whom he admired as visionaries far ahead of their time and heralding a new age. The only mathematician on his list was <a href="Bernhard%20Riemann">Bernhard Riemann</a>. Influenced by the Catholic mystic <a href="Marthe%20Robin">Marthe Robin</a> who was claimed to survive on the Holy Eucharist alone, Grothendieck almost starved himself to death in 1988. His growing preoccupation with spiritual matters was also evident in a letter titled "Lettre de la Bonne Nouvelle" sent to 250 friends in January 1990. In it, he described his encounters with a deity and announced that a "New Age" would commence on 14 October 1996.Grothendieck descent into psychosis was easy to spot from the letter sent to his friends he talks about his religious instruction which came into him in dreams revealed from God and that he was chosen by god for a mission starting in announcing the new age,furthermore a psychotic symptom appears his voice is gradually hijacked,in his words "a voice which comes out of my mind when inhaling,as if it were a second voice coming from me" Flora takes form : the female personality of God , a second episode takes place and now he mistakes it for Marthe Robin "the voice coming out of my throat, which was masquerading as Marthe Robin" then changes for God again.In the early part of 1990 he fasts for 45 days this episode is nearly lethal for him his son Alexandre recalls he was like an Auschwitz prisoner.<a href="http%3A//www.math.jussieu.fr/%7Eleila/grothendieckcircle/Spirituality/Spirituality29.pdf"></a>

Over 20,000 pages of Grothendieck's mathematical and other writings, held at the University of Montpellier, remain unpublished. They have been digitized for preservation and are freely available in open access through the <a href="http%3A//imag.edu.umontpellier.fr">Institut Montpelliérain Alexander Grothendieck</a> portal.

In 1991, Grothendieck moved to a new address which he did not provide to his previous contacts in the mathematical community. Very few people visited him afterward. Local villagers helped sustain him with a more varied diet after he tried to live on a staple of <a href="Taraxacum">dandelion soup</a>. After his death, it was revealed that he lived alone in a house in <a href="Lasserre%2C%20Ari%C3%A8ge">Lasserre, Ariège</a>, a small village at the foot of the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>.

In January 2010, Grothendieck wrote the letter "Déclaration d'intention de non-publication" to <a href="Luc%20Illusie">Luc Illusie</a>, claiming that all materials published in his absence have been published without his permission. He asks that none of his work be reproduced in whole or in part and that copies of this work be removed from libraries. A website devoted to his work was called "an abomination." This order may have been reversed later in 2010.

On 13 November 2014, aged 86, Grothendieck died in the hospital of <a href="Saint-Girons%2C%20Ari%C3%A8ge">Saint-Girons, Ariège</a>.

Grothendieck was born in <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Germany</a>. In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his nationality were destroyed in the fall of Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war. He thus became a stateless person for at least the majority of his working life, traveling on a <a href="Nansen%20passport">Nansen passport</a>. Part of this reluctance to hold French nationality is attributed to not wishing to serve in the French military, particularly due to the <a href="Algerian%20War">Algerian War</a> (1954–62). He eventually applied for French citizenship in the early 1980s, well past the age that exempted him from military service.

Grothendieck was very close to his mother to whom he dedicated his dissertation. She died in 1957 from the <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> that she contracted in camps for displaced persons. He had five children: a son with his landlady during his time in Nancy, three children, Johanna (1959), Alexander (1961) and Mathieu (1965) with his wife Mireille Dufour, and one child with Justine Skalba, with whom he lived in a commune in the early 1970s.

Grothendieck's early mathematical work was in <a href="functional%20analysis">functional analysis</a>. Between 1949 and 1953 he worked on his doctoral thesis in this subject at <a href="Nancy%2C%20France">Nancy</a>, supervised by <a href="Jean%20Dieudonn%C3%A9">Jean Dieudonné</a> and <a href="Laurent%20Schwartz">Laurent Schwartz</a>. His key contributions include <a href="topological%20tensor%20product">topological tensor product</a>s of <a href="topological%20vector%20space">topological vector space</a>s, the theory of <a href="nuclear%20space">nuclear space</a>s as foundational for <a href="Schwartz%20distribution">Schwartz distribution</a>s, and the application of <a href="Lp%20space">L spaces</a> in studying linear maps between topological vector spaces. In a few years, he had turned himself into a leading authority on this area of functional analysis—to the extent that Dieudonné compares his impact in this field to that of <a href="Stefan%20Banach">Banach</a>.

It is, however, in <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a> and related fields where Grothendieck did his most important and influential work. From about 1955 he started to work on <a href="sheaf%20%28mathematics%29">sheaf</a> theory and <a href="homological%20algebra">homological algebra</a>, producing the influential "<a href="T%C3%B4hoku%20paper">Tôhoku paper</a>" ("Sur quelques points d'algèbre homologique", published in the <a href="Tohoku%20Mathematical%20Journal">Tohoku Mathematical Journal</a> in 1957) where he introduced <a href="Abelian%20category">abelian categories</a> and applied their theory to show that <a href="sheaf%20cohomology">sheaf cohomology</a> can be defined as certain <a href="derived%20functor">derived functor</a>s in this context.

Homological methods and sheaf theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a> and others, after sheaves had been defined by <a href="Jean%20Leray">Jean Leray</a>. Grothendieck took them to a higher level of abstraction and turned them into a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to the "<a href="Grothendieck%27s%20relative%20point%20of%20view">relative point of view</a>" (pairs of varieties related by a <a href="morphism">morphism</a>), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems. The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of a <a href="coherent%20sheaf">coherent sheaf</a> on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the <a href="higher%20direct%20image">higher direct image</a>s of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space.

In 1956, he applied the same thinking to the <a href="Riemann%E2%80%93Roch%20theorem">Riemann–Roch theorem</a>, which had already recently been generalized to any dimension by <a href="Friedrich%20Hirzebruch">Hirzebruch</a>. The <a href="Grothendieck%E2%80%93Riemann%E2%80%93Roch%20theorem">Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem</a> was announced by Grothendieck at the initial <a href="Mathematische%20Arbeitstagung">Mathematische Arbeitstagung</a> in <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a>, in 1957. It appeared in print in a paper written by <a href="Armand%20Borel">Armand Borel</a> with Serre. This result was his first work in algebraic geometry. He went on to plan and execute a programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which were then in a state of flux and under discussion in <a href="Claude%20Chevalley">Claude Chevalley</a>'s seminar; he outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 <a href="International%20Congress%20of%20Mathematicians">International Congress of Mathematicians</a>.

His foundational work on algebraic geometry is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed <a href="generic%20point">generic point</a>s, which led to the theory of <a href="scheme%20%28mathematics%29">schemes</a>. He also pioneered the systematic use of <a href="nilpotent">nilpotent</a>s. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a> information, in purely algebraic settings. His "theory of schemes" has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use <a href="birational%20geometry">birational geometry</a>, techniques from <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>, <a href="Galois%20theory">Galois theory</a> and <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a>, and close analogues of the methods of <a href="algebraic%20topology">algebraic topology</a>, all in an integrated way.

He is also noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation. Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the <a href="learned%20journal">learned journal</a>, circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal. His influence spilled over into many other branches of mathematics, for example the contemporary theory of <a href="D-module">D-module</a>s. (It also provoked adverse reactions, with many mathematicians seeking out more concrete areas and problems.)

The bulk of Grothendieck's published work is collected in the monumental, yet incomplete, "<a href="%C3%89l%C3%A9ments%20de%20g%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie%20alg%C3%A9brique">Éléments de géométrie algébrique</a>" ("EGA") and "<a href="S%C3%A9minaire%20de%20g%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie%20alg%C3%A9brique">Séminaire de géométrie algébrique</a>" ("SGA"). The collection "<a href="Fondements%20de%20la%20G%C3%A9ometrie%20Alg%C3%A9brique">Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique</a>" ("FGA"), which gathers together talks given in the <a href="S%C3%A9minaire%20Bourbaki">Séminaire Bourbaki</a>, also contains important material.

Grothendieck's work includes the invention of the <a href="%C3%89tale%20cohomology">étale</a> and <a href="l-adic%20cohomology">l-adic cohomology</a> theories, which explain an observation of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Weil">André Weil</a>'s that there is a connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties. For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a <a href="finite%20field">finite field</a> reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.

This program culminated in the proofs of the <a href="Weil%20conjectures">Weil conjectures</a>, the last of which was settled by Grothendieck's student <a href="Pierre%20Deligne">Pierre Deligne</a> in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.

Grothendieck wrote a retrospective assessment of his mathematical work (see the external link "La Vision" below). As his main mathematical achievements ("maître-thèmes"), he chose this collection of 12 topics (his chronological order):


He wrote that the central theme of the topics above is that of topos theory, while the first and last were of the least importance to him.

Here the term "yoga" denotes a kind of "meta-theory" that can be used heuristically; <a href="Michel%20Raynaud">Michel Raynaud</a> writes the other terms "Ariadne's thread" and "philosophy" as effective equivalents.

Grothendieck is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century. In an obituary <a href="David%20Mumford">David Mumford</a> and <a href="John%20Tate">John Tate</a> wrote:
Although mathematics became more and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend. His unique skill was to eliminate all unnecessary hypotheses and burrow into an area so deeply that its inner patterns on the most abstract level revealed themselves–and then, like a magician, show how the solution of old problems fell out in straightforward ways now that their real nature had been revealed.

By the 1970s, Grothendieck's work was seen as influential not only in algebraic geometry, and the allied fields of sheaf theory and homological algebra, but influenced logic, in the field of categorical logic.

Grothendieck approached algebraic geometry by clarifying the foundations of the field, and by developing mathematical tools intended to prove a number of notable conjectures. Algebraic geometry has traditionally meant the understanding of geometric objects, such as <a href="algebraic%20curve">algebraic curve</a>s and surfaces, through the study of the algebraic equations for those objects. Properties of algebraic equations are in turn studied using the techniques of <a href="ring%20theory">ring theory</a>. In this approach, the properties of a geometric object are related to the properties of an associated ring. The space (e.g., real, complex, or projective) in which the object is defined is extrinsic to the object, while the ring is intrinsic.

Grothendieck laid a new foundation for algebraic geometry by making intrinsic spaces ("spectra") and associated rings the primary objects of study. To that end he developed the theory of <a href="Scheme%20%28mathematics%29">schemes</a>, which can be informally thought of as <a href="topological%20space">topological space</a>s on which a <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a> is associated to every open subset of the space. Schemes have become the basic objects of study for practitioners of modern algebraic geometry. Their use as a foundation allowed geometry to absorb technical advances from other fields.

His <a href="Grothendieck%E2%80%93Hirzebruch%E2%80%93Riemann%E2%80%93Roch%20theorem">generalization</a> of the classical <a href="Riemann-Roch%20theorem">Riemann-Roch theorem</a> related topological properties of complex <a href="algebraic%20curve">algebraic curve</a>s to their algebraic structure. The tools he developed to prove this theorem started the study of <a href="Algebraic%20K-theory">algebraic</a> and <a href="topological%20K-theory">topological K-theory</a>, which study the topological properties of objects by associating them with rings. Topological K-theory was founded by <a href="Michael%20Atiyah">Michael Atiyah</a>, after direct contact with Grothendieck's ideas at the <a href="Bonn%20Arbeitstagung">Bonn Arbeitstagung</a>.

Grothendieck's construction of new <a href="cohomology">cohomology</a> theories, which use algebraic techniques to study topological objects, has influenced the development of <a href="algebraic%20number%20theory">algebraic number theory</a>, <a href="algebraic%20topology">algebraic topology</a>, and <a href="representation%20theory">representation theory</a>. As part of this project, his creation of <a href="topos%20theory">topos theory</a>, a category-theoretic generalization of <a href="point-set%20topology">point-set topology</a>, has influenced the fields of <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a> and <a href="mathematical%20logic">mathematical logic</a>.

The <a href="Weil%20conjectures">Weil conjectures</a> were formulated in the later 1940s as a set of mathematical problems in <a href="arithmetic%20geometry">arithmetic geometry</a>. They describe properties of analytic invariants, called <a href="local%20zeta%20function">local zeta function</a>s, of the number of points on an algebraic curve or variety of higher dimension. Grothendieck's discovery of the <a href="%C3%A9tale%20cohomology">ℓ-adic étale cohomology</a>, the first example of a <a href="Weil%20cohomology">Weil cohomology</a> theory, opened the way for a proof of the Weil conjectures, ultimately completed in the 1970s by his student <a href="Pierre%20Deligne">Pierre Deligne</a>. Grothendieck's large-scale approach has been called a "visionary program." The ℓ-adic cohomology then became a fundamental tool for number theorists, with applications to the <a href="Langlands%20program">Langlands program</a>.

Grothendieck's conjectural theory of <a href="Motive%20%28algebraic%20geometry%29">motive</a>s was intended to be the "ℓ-adic" theory but without the choice of "ℓ", a prime number. It did not provide the intended route to the Weil conjectures, but has been behind modern developments in <a href="algebraic%20K-theory">algebraic K-theory</a>, <a href="Motivic%20cohomology">motivic homotopy theory</a>, and <a href="motivic%20integration">motivic integration</a>. This theory, <a href="Daniel%20Quillen">Daniel Quillen</a>'s work, and Grothendieck's theory of <a href="Chern%20class">Chern class</a>es, are considered the background to the theory of <a href="algebraic%20cobordism">algebraic cobordism</a>, another algebraic analogue of topological ideas.

Grothendieck's emphasis on the role of <a href="Universal%20property">universal properties</a> across varied mathematical structures brought <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a> into the mainstream as an organizing principle for mathematics in general. Among its uses, category theory creates a common language for describing similar structures and techniques seen in many different mathematical systems. His notion of <a href="abelian%20category">abelian category</a> is now the basic object of study in <a href="homological%20algebra">homological algebra</a>. The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck's influence, though unintentional.

The novel "Colonel Lágrimas" (available in English by Restless Books) by Puerto Rican - Costa Rican writer Carlos Fonseca is a semibiographic novel about Grothendieck.

<doc id="2047" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047" title="Alcoholics Anonymous">
Alcoholics Anonymous

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international <a href="Social%20work%20with%20groups%23Mutual%20aid">mutual aid</a> fellowship founded in 1935 by <a href="Bill%20W.">Bill Wilson</a> and <a href="Bob%20Smith%20%28doctor%29">Dr. Bob Smith</a> in <a href="Akron%2C%20Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a>. AA's stated "primary purpose" is to help <a href="alcoholics">alcoholics</a> "stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve <a href="sobriety">sobriety</a>". With other early members, Bill Wilson and Bob Smith developed AA's <a href="the%20Twelve%20Steps">Twelve Step</a> program of spiritual and character development. AA's initial <a href="Twelve%20Traditions">Twelve Traditions</a> were introduced in 1946 to help the fellowship be stable and unified while disengaged from "outside issues" and influences.

The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, and avoid official affiliations with other organizations. They also advise against <a href="dogma">dogma</a> and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as <a href="Narcotics%20Anonymous">Narcotics Anonymous</a> have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.

According to AA's 2014 membership survey, 27% of members have been sober less than one year, 24% have 1–5 years sober, 13% have 5–10 years, 14% have 10–20 years, and 22% have more than 20 years sober. Studies of AA's efficacy have produced inconsistent results. While some studies have suggested an association between AA attendance and increased abstinence or other positive outcomes, other studies have not.

The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, joined in 1939. The first Black AA group was established in 1945 in Washington DC by Jim S., an African American physician from Virginia. AA membership has since spread internationally "across <a href="Cultural%20diversity">diverse cultures</a> holding different beliefs and values", including geopolitical areas resistant to <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> movements. Close to 2 million people worldwide are members of AA as of 2016.

AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called "The Big Book", originally titled "<a href="The%20Big%20Book%20%28Alcoholics%20Anonymous%29">Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism</a>".

AA sprang from <a href="The%20Oxford%20Group">The Oxford Group</a>, a non-denominational movement modeled after <a href="first-century%20Christianity">first-century Christianity</a>. Some members founded the Group to help in maintaining sobriety. "Grouper" <a href="Ebby%20Thacher">Ebby Thacher</a> was Wilson's former drinking buddy who approached Wilson saying that he had "got religion", was sober, and that Wilson could do the same if he set aside objections to religion and instead formed a personal idea of God, "another power" or "higher power".

Feeling a "kinship of common suffering" and, though drunk, Wilson attended his first Group gathering. Within days, Wilson admitted himself to the <a href="Charles%20B.%20Towns">Charles B. Towns Hospital</a> after drinking four beers on the way—the last alcohol he ever drank. Under the care of <a href="William%20Duncan%20Silkworth">Dr. William Duncan Silkworth</a> (an early benefactor of AA), Wilson's detox included the <a href="deliriant">deliriant</a> <a href="Atropa%20belladonna">belladonna</a>. At the hospital a despairing Wilson experienced a bright flash of light, which he felt to be God revealing himself. Following his hospital discharge Wilson joined the Oxford Group and recruited other alcoholics to the Group. Wilson's early efforts to help others become sober were ineffective, prompting Dr. Silkworth to suggest that Wilson place less stress on religion and more on "the science" of treating alcoholism. Wilson's first success came during a business trip to Akron, Ohio, where he was introduced to Dr. Robert Smith, a surgeon and Oxford Group member who was unable to stay sober. After thirty days of working with Wilson, Smith drank his last drink on June 10, 1935, the date marked by AA for its anniversaries.

While Wilson and Smith credited their sobriety to working with alcoholics under the auspices of the Oxford Group, a Group associate <a href="pastor">pastor</a> sermonized against Wilson and his alcoholic Groupers for forming a "secret, ashamed sub-group" engaged in "divergent works". By 1937, Wilson separated from the Oxford Group. AA Historian Ernest Kurtz described the split:
"...more and more, Bill discovered that new adherents could get sober by believing in each other and in the strength of this group. Men [no women were members yet] who had proven over and over again, by extremely painful experience, that they could not get sober on their own had somehow become more powerful when two or three of them worked on their common problem. This, then—whatever it was that occurred among them—was what they could accept as a power greater than themselves. They did not need the Oxford Group."
In 1955, Wilson acknowledged AA's debt, saying "The Oxford Groupers had clearly shown us what to do. And just as importantly, we learned from them "what not to do."" Among the Oxford Group practices that AA retained were informal gatherings, a "changed-life" developed through "stages", and working with others for no material gain, AA's analogs for these are meetings, "the steps", and sponsorship. AA's tradition of anonymity was a reaction to the publicity-seeking practices of the Oxford Group, as well as AA's wish to not promote, Wilson said, "erratic public characters who through broken anonymity might get drunk and destroy confidence in us."

To share their method, Wilson and other members wrote the initially-titled book, "Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism", from which AA drew its name. Informally known as "The Big Book" (with its first 164 pages virtually unchanged since the 1939 edition), it suggests a twelve-step program in which members admit that they are powerless over alcohol and need help from a "higher power". They seek guidance and strength through prayer and meditation from God or a <a href="Higher%20Power">Higher Power</a> of their own understanding; take a moral inventory with care to include resentments; list and become ready to remove character defects; list and make amends to those harmed; continue to take a moral inventory, pray, meditate, and try to help other alcoholics recover. The second half of the book, "Personal Stories" (subject to additions, removal and retitling in subsequent editions), is made of AA members' redemptive autobiographical sketches.

In 1941, interviews on American radio and favorable articles in US magazines, including a piece by Jack Alexander in "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>", led to increased book sales and membership. By 1946, as the growing fellowship quarreled over structure, purpose, and authority, as well as finances and publicity, Wilson began to form and promote what became known as AA's "Twelve Traditions," which are guidelines for an altruistic, unaffiliated, non-coercive, and non-hierarchical structure that limited AA's purpose to only helping alcoholics on a non-professional level while shunning publicity. Eventually he gained formal adoption and inclusion of the Twelve Traditions in all future editions of the Big Book. At the 1955 conference in St. Louis, Missouri, Wilson relinquished stewardship of AA to the General Service Conference, as AA grew to millions of members internationally.

AA says it is "not organized in the formal or political sense", and Bill Wilson called it a "benign <a href="anarchy">anarchy</a>". In Ireland, Shane Butler said that AA “looks like it couldn’t survive as there’s no leadership or top-level telling local <a href="cumann">cumann</a>s what to do, but it has worked and proved itself extremely robust.” Butler explained that "AA’s 'inverted pyramid' style of governance has helped it to avoid many of the pitfalls that political and religious institutions have encountered since it was established here in 1946."

In 2006, AA counted 1,867,212 members and 106,202 AA groups worldwide. The Twelve Traditions informally guide how individual AA groups function, and the Twelve Concepts for World Service guide how the organization is structured globally.

A member who accepts a service position or an organizing role is a "trusted servant" with terms rotating and limited, typically lasting three months to two years and determined by group vote and the nature of the position. Each group is a self-governing entity with AA World Services acting only in an advisory capacity. AA is served entirely by alcoholics, except for seven "nonalcoholic friends of the fellowship" of the 21-member AA Board of Trustees.

AA groups are self-supporting, relying on voluntary donations from members to cover expenses. The AA General Service Office (GSO) limits contributions to US$3,000 a year. Above the group level, AA may hire outside professionals for services that require specialized expertise or full-time responsibilities.

Like individual groups, the GSO is self-supporting. AA receives proceeds from books and literature that constitute more than 50% of the income for its General Service Office. In keeping with A.A.’s Seventh Tradition, the Central Office is fully self-supporting through the sale of literature and related products, and through the voluntary donations of A.A. members and groups. It does not accept donations from people or organizations outside of A.A.

In keeping with A.A.’s Eighth Tradition, the Central Office employs special workers who are compensated financially for their services, but their services do not include traditional “12th Step” work of working with alcoholics in need. All 12th Step calls that come to the Central Office are handed to sober A.A. members who have volunteered to handle these calls. It also maintains service centers, which coordinate activities such as printing literature, responding to public inquiries, and organizing conferences. Other International General Service Offices (Australia, Costa Rica, Russia, etc.) are independent of AA World Services in New York.

AA's program extends beyond abstaining alcohol. Its goal is to effect enough change in the alcoholic's thinking "to bring about recovery from alcoholism" through "an entire psychic change," or spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening is meant to be achieved by taking the <a href="Twelve%20Steps">Twelve Steps</a>, and sobriety is furthered by volunteering for AA and regular AA meeting attendance or contact with AA members. Members are encouraged to find an experienced fellow alcoholic, called a sponsor, to help them understand and follow the AA program. The sponsor should preferably have experience of all twelve of the steps, be the same sex as the sponsored person, and refrain from imposing personal views on the sponsored person. Following the <a href="Helper%20theory">helper therapy principle</a>, sponsors in AA may benefit from their relationship with their charges, as "helping behaviors" correlate with increased abstinence and lower probabilities of binge drinking.

AA's program is an inheritor of <a href="Counter-Enlightenment">Counter-Enlightenment</a> philosophy. AA shares the view that acceptance of one's inherent limitations is critical to finding one's proper place among other humans and God. Such ideas are described as "Counter-Enlightenment" because they are contrary to the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>'s ideal that humans have the capacity to make their lives and societies a heaven on earth using their own power and reason.
After evaluating AA's literature and observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil found that for an AA member to remain sober a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's <a href="world%20view">worldview</a>. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a "quasi-religious organization".

AA meetings are "quasi-ritualized therapeutic sessions run by and for, alcoholics". They are usually informal and often feature discussions. Local AA directories list a variety of weekly meetings. Those listed as "closed" are available to those with a self professed "desire to stop drinking," which cannot be challenged by another member on any grounds. "Open" meetings are available to anyone (nonalcoholics can attend as observers). At speaker meetings, one or two members tell their stories, while discussion meetings allocate the most time for general discussion. Some meetings are devoted to studying and discussing the AA literature.

AA meetings do not exclude other alcoholics, though some meetings cater to specific demographics such as <a href="gender">gender</a>, profession, age, <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a>, or culture. Meetings in the United States are held in a variety of languages including <a href="Armenian%20%28language%29">Armenian</a>, <a href="English%20%28language%29">English</a>, <a href="Farsi%20%28language%29">Farsi</a>, <a href="Finnish%20%28language%29">Finnish</a>, <a href="French%20%28language%29">French</a>, <a href="Japanese%20%28language%29">Japanese</a>, <a href="Korean%20%28language%29">Korean</a>, <a href="Russian%20%28language%29">Russian</a>, and <a href="Spanish%20%28language%29">Spanish</a>. While AA has pamphlets that suggest meeting formats, groups have the autonomy to hold and conduct meetings as they wish "except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a whole". Different cultures affect ritual aspects of meetings, but around the world "many particularities of the AA meeting format can be observed at almost any AA gathering".

US courts have not extended the status of <a href="privileged%20communication">privileged communication</a>, such as that enjoyed by <a href="clergy">clergy</a> and lawyers, to AA related communications between members.

A study found an association between an increase in attendance to AA meetings with increased spirituality and a decrease in the frequency and intensity of alcohol use. The research also found that AA was effective at helping <a href="agnostic">agnostic</a>s and <a href="atheist">atheist</a>s become sober. The authors concluded that though spirituality was an important mechanism of behavioral change for some alcoholics, it was not the only effective mechanism. Since the mid-1970s, a number of 'agnostic' or 'no-prayer' AA groups have begun across the U.S., Canada, and other parts of the world, which hold meetings that adhere to a tradition allowing alcoholics to freely express their doubts or disbelief that spirituality will help their recovery, and forgo use of opening or closing prayers. There are online resources listing AA meetings for atheists and agnostics.

More informally than not, AA's membership has helped popularize the disease concept of alcoholism, though AA officially has had no part in the development of such postulates which had appeared as early as the late eighteenth century. Though AA initially avoided the term "disease", in 1973 conference-approved literature categorically stated that "we had the disease of alcoholism." Regardless of official positions, from AA's inception most members have believed alcoholism to be a disease.

Though cautious regarding the medical nature of alcoholism, AA has let others voice opinions. The Big Book states that alcoholism "is an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer." Ernest Kurtz says this is "The closest the book Alcoholics Anonymous comes to a definition of alcoholism." In his introduction to The Big Book, non-member <a href="William%20Duncan%20Silkworth">Dr. William Silkworth</a> said those unable to moderate their drinking have an <a href="allergy">allergy</a>. Addressing the allergy concept, AA said "The doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little. But as ex-problem drinkers, we can say that his explanation makes good sense. It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account." AA later acknowledged that "alcoholism is not a true allergy, the experts now inform us." Wilson explained in 1960 why AA had refrained from using the term "disease":
We AAs have never called alcoholism a disease because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.

AA's New York General Service Office regularly surveys AA members in North America. Its 2014 survey of over 6,000 members in Canada and the United States concluded that, in North America, AA members who responded to the survey were 62% male and 38% female.

Average member sobriety is slightly under 10 years with 36% sober more than ten years, 13% sober from five to ten years, 24% sober from one to five years, and 27% sober less than one year. Before coming to AA, 63% of members received some type of treatment or counseling, such as medical, psychological, or spiritual. After coming to AA, 59% received outside treatment or counseling. Of those members, 84% said that outside help played an important part in their recovery.

The same survey showed that AA received 32% of its membership from other members, another 32% from treatment facilities, 30% were self-motivated to attend AA, 12% of its membership from court–ordered attendance, and only 1% of AA members decided to join based on information obtained from the Internet. People taking the survey were allowed to select multiple answers for what motivated them to join AA.

AA tends to polarize observers into believers and non-believers, and discussion of AA often creates controversy rather than objective reflection. Moreover, a <a href="randomized%20study">randomized study</a> of AA is difficult: AA members are not randomly selected from the population of chronic alcoholics; they are instead self-selected or mandated by courts to attend AA meetings. There are two opposing types of <a href="self-selection%20bias">self-selection bias</a>: (1) drinkers may be motivated to stop drinking before they participate in AA; (2) AA may attract the more severe and difficult cases.

Studies of AA's efficacy have produced inconsistent results. While some studies have suggested an association between AA attendance and increased abstinence or other positive outcomes, other studies have not. Even <a href="meta-analyses">meta-analyses</a> and <a href="literature%20review">literature review</a>s have resulted in widely divergent conclusions.

The 2006 <a href="Cochrane%20Review">Cochrane Review</a> of eight studies (the studies reviewed were done between 1967 and 2005) measuring the effectiveness of AA found no significant difference between the results of AA and twelve-step participation compared to other treatments, stating that "<a href="experiment">experiment</a>al studies have on the whole failed to demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing alcohol dependence or drinking problems when compared to other <a href="wikt%3Aintervention">intervention</a>s."

A 2014 study by Keith Humphreys, Janet Blodgett and Todd Wagner concluded that "increasing AA attendance leads to short and long term decreases in alcohol consumption that cannot be attributed to <a href="self-selection">self-selection</a>." <a href="Austin%20Frakt">Austin Frakt</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", discusses how the study's methodology minimizes outside factors, such as how motivated the people who succeed at becoming abstinent are.

A meta-analysis by Dr. Lee Ann Kaskutas in 2009 reported that while the evidence base for twelve step groups from experimental studies was weak, "other categories of evidence... are overwhelmingly convincing". Specifically, the correlation between exposure to AA and outcome, the <a href="dose-response%20relationship">dose-response relationship</a>, and the consistency of the association were found to be very strong. In other words, the frequency by which individuals attend meetings appears to have a <a href="statistically%20significant">statistically significant</a> <a href="correlation">correlation</a> with maintaining abstinence. Kaskutas noted two studies which both found that 70% of those who attended twelve-step groups at least weekly were abstaining from alcohol consumption at follow ups two and sixteen years later. Those who attended less than once per week showed about the same success rate as those who didn’t attend meetings. Kaskutas also found AA to function consistently with known <a href="behavioral%20change%20theories">behavioral change theories</a> and substantial <a href="empirical%20evidence">empirical</a> support for specific mechanisms through which AA facilitates change.

A preliminary study suggested that "AA <a href="prayers">prayers</a>" help long-term AA members reduce <a href="craving%20%28withdrawal%29">craving</a>s for alcohol. The study used a <a href="Magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">MRI</a> machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study <a href="random%20assignment">randomly assigned</a> the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in <a href="the%20Big%20Book%20of%20Alcoholics%20Anonymous">the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had just seen the prayers reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed that there was a different reaction.

Dr. Lance Dodes, in his 2014 book "The Sober Truth", argues that most people who have experienced AA have not achieved long-term sobriety, making the controversial argument that research indicates that only 5 to 8 percent of the people who go to one or more AA meetings achieve sobriety for longer than one year. Gabrielle Glaser used Dodes' figures to argue that AA has a low success rate in a 2015 article for "The Atlantic".

The 5 to 8 percent figure put forward by Dodes is controversial; Thomas Beresford, MD, writing for the <a href="National%20Council%20on%20Alcoholism%20and%20Drug%20Dependence">National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence</a>, says that the book uses "three separate, questionable, calculations that arrive at the 5–8% figure." This is not the only criticism the book has received. <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> <a href="clinical%20psychiatry">clinical psychiatry</a> professor Richard A. Friedman, in his review for the <a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>, called "The Sober Truth" a "<a href="polemic">polemic</a>al and deeply flawed book", noting that it was designed to promote <a href="psychodynamic%20therapy">psychodynamic therapy</a> for addiction, which itself lacks a strong evidence base. John F. Kelly, an associate professor at <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a>, as well as Gene Beresin, a professor at Harvard, feel that the book's conclusion that "[12-step] approaches are almost completely ineffective and even harmful in treating substance use disorders" is wrong, noting that "studies published in prestigious <a href="peer-reviewed">peer-reviewed</a> scientific journals have found that 12-step treatments that facilitate engagement with AA post-discharge [...] produce about one third higher continuous abstinence rates" 

As a volunteer-supported program, AA is free of charge. This contrasts with <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation">treatments for alcoholism</a> such as <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation%23Residential%20treatment">inpatient treatment</a>, <a href="Pharmacotherapy%20for%20alcohol%20dependence">drug therapy</a>, <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation%23Counseling">psychotherapy</a>, and <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation%23Cognitive%20therapy">cognitive-based therapy</a>. One study found that the institutional use of twelve-step-facilitation therapy to encourage participation in AA reduced healthcare expenditures by 45% when compared to another group that was not encouraged to participate in AA.

Many AA meetings take place in treatment facilities. Carrying the message of AA into hospitals was how the co-founders of AA first remained sober. They discovered great value of working with alcoholics who are still suffering, and that even if the alcoholic they were working with did not stay sober, they did. Bill Wilson wrote, "Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics". Bill Wilson visited Towns Hospital in New York City in an attempt to help the alcoholics who were patients there in 1934. At <a href="St.%20Thomas%20Hospital%20%28Akron%2C%20Ohio%29">St. Thomas Hospital</a> in Akron, Ohio, Smith worked with still more alcoholics. In 1939, a New York mental institution, Rockland State Hospital, was one of the first institutions to allow AA hospital groups. Service to corrections and treatment facilities used to be combined until the General Service Conference, in 1977, voted to dissolve its Institutions Committee and form two separate committees, one for treatment facilities, and one for correctional facilities.

In the United States and Canada, AA meetings are held in hundreds of correctional facilities. The AA General Service Office has published a workbook with detailed recommendations for methods of approaching correctional-facility officials with the intent of developing an in-prison AA program. In addition, AA publishes a variety of pamphlets specifically for the incarcerated alcoholic. Additionally, the AA General Service Office provides a pamphlet with guidelines for members working with incarcerated alcoholics.

United States courts have ruled that inmates, parolees, and probationers cannot be ordered to attend AA. Though AA itself was not deemed a religion, it was ruled that it contained "enough" religious components (variously described in "Griffin v. Coughlin" below as, inter alia, "religion", "religious activity", "religious exercise") to make coerced attendance at AA meetings a violation of the <a href="Establishment%20Clause">Establishment Clause</a> of the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> of the constitution. In 2007, the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals</a> stated that a parolee who was ordered to attend AA had standing to sue his parole office.

In 1949, the <a href="Hazelden">Hazelden</a> treatment center was founded and staffed by AA members, and since then many alcoholic rehabilitation clinics have incorporated AA's precepts into their treatment programs. 32% of AA's membership was introduced to it through a treatment facility.

A cross-sectional survey of substance-misuse treatment providers in the West Midlands found fewer than 10% integrated twelve-step methods in their practice and only a third felt their consumers were suited for Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous membership. Less than half were likely to recommend self-help groups to their clients. Providers with nursing qualifications were more likely to make such referrals than those without them. A statistically significant correlation was found between providers' self-reported level of spirituality and their likelihood of recommending AA or NA.

"Thirteenth-stepping" is a pejorative term for AA members approaching new members for dates or sex. The "Journal of Addiction Nursing" reported that 50% of the women that participated in a survey (55 in all) experienced 13-stepping behavior from others. AA's pamphlet on sponsorship suggests that men be sponsored by men and women be sponsored by women.

<a href="Stanton%20Peele">Stanton Peele</a> argued that some AA groups apply the <a href="Disease%20model%20of%20addiction">disease model</a> to all problem drinkers, whether or not they are "full-blown" alcoholics. Along with Nancy Shute, Peele has advocated that besides AA, other options should be readily available to those problem drinkers who are able to manage their drinking with the right treatment. The Big Book says "moderate drinkers" and "a certain type of hard drinker" are able to stop or moderate their drinking. The Big Book suggests no program for these drinkers, but instead seeks to help drinkers without "power of choice in drink."

One review of AA warned of detrimental <a href="iatrogenesis">iatrogenic</a> effects of twelve-step philosophy and concluded that AA uses many methods that are also used by cults. A subsequent study concluded, however, that AA's program bore little resemblance to religious cults because the techniques used appeared beneficial. Another study found that the AA program's focus on admission of having a problem increases deviant <a href="Stigma%20%28sociological%20theory%29">stigma</a> and strips members of their previous <a href="cultural%20identity">cultural identity</a>, replacing it with the deviant identity. A survey of group members, however, found they had a <a href="Biculturalism">bicultural</a> identity and saw AA's program as a complement to their other national, ethnic, and religious cultures.

Alcoholics Anonymous publishes several books, reports, pamphlets, and other media, including a periodical known as the "AA Grapevine". Two books are used primarily: "Alcoholics Anonymous" (the "Big Book") and "<a href="Twelve%20Steps%20and%20Twelve%20Traditions">Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</a>", the latter explaining AA's fundamental principles in depth. The full text of each of these two books is available on the AA website at no charge.

<doc id="2049" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2049" title="Alpha compositing">
Alpha compositing

In <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a>, alpha compositing is the process of combining an image with a background to create the appearance of partial or full transparency. It is often useful to render image elements in separate passes, and then combine the resulting multiple <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D</a> images into a single, final image called the <a href="compositing">composite</a>. For example, compositing is used extensively when combining computer-rendered image elements with live footage.

In order to combine these image elements correctly, it is necessary to keep an associated "<a href="matte%20%28filmmaking%29">matte</a>" for each element. This matte contains the coverage information—the shape of the geometry being drawn—making it possible to distinguish between parts of the image where the geometry was actually drawn and other parts of the image that are empty.

To store matte information, the concept of an alpha channel was introduced by <a href="Alvy%20Ray%20Smith">Alvy Ray Smith</a> in the late 1970s, and fully developed in a 1984 paper by <a href="Thomas%20Porter%20%28Pixar%29">Thomas Porter</a> and <a href="Tom%20Duff">Tom Duff</a>. In a 2D image element, which stores a color for each pixel, additional data is stored in the alpha channel with a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel does not have any coverage information and is transparent; i.e. there was no color contribution from any geometry because the geometry did not overlap this pixel. A value of 1 means that the pixel is opaque because the geometry completely overlapped the pixel.

If an alpha channel is used in an image, there are two common representations that are available: straight (unassociated) alpha, and premultiplied (associated) alpha.

With straight alpha, the RGB components represent the color of the object or pixel, disregarding its opacity.

With premultiplied alpha, the RGB components represent the color of the object or pixel, adjusted for its opacity by multiplication. A more obvious advantage of this is that, in certain situations, it can save a subsequent multiplication (e.g. if the image is used many times during later compositing). However, the most significant advantages of using premultiplied alpha are for correctness and simplicity rather than performance: premultiplied alpha allows correct filtering and blending. In addition, premultiplied alpha allows regions of regular alpha blending and regions with <a href="additive%20blending%20mode">additive blending mode</a> to be encoded within the same image.

Assuming that the pixel color is expressed using "straight" (non-premultiplied) RGBA <a href="tuple">tuple</a>s, a pixel value of (0.0, 0.7, 0.0, 0.5) implies a pixel that has 70% of the maximum green intensity and 50% opacity. If the color were fully green, its RGBA would be (0, 1, 0, 0.5).

However, if this pixel uses premultiplied alpha, all of the RGB values (0, 1, 0) are multiplied by 0.5 and then the alpha is appended to the end to yield (0, 0.5, 0, 0.5). In this case, the 0.5 value for the G channel actually indicates 100% green intensity (with 50% opacity). For this reason, knowing whether a file uses straight or premultiplied alpha is essential to correctly process or composite it.

The <a href="%23Analytical%20derivation%20of%20the%20over%20operator">over operator</a> is mathematically identical for both straight alpha colours and pre-multiplied alpha colours. It is often said that <a href="Associativity">associativity</a> is an advantage of pre-multiplied alpha blending over straight alpha blending, but both are associative. The only important difference is in the dynamic range of the colour representation in finite precision numerical calculations (which is in all applications): premultiplied alpha has a unique representation for transparent pixels, avoiding the need to choose a "clear color" or resultant artefacts such as edge fringes (see the next paragraphs). In other words, color information of transparent pixels is lost in premultiplied alpha, as the conversion from premultiplied alpha to straight alpha is undefined for alpha equal to zero.
Premultiplied alpha has some practical advantages over normal alpha blending because <a href="interpolation">interpolation</a> and <a href="Filter%20%28signal%20processing%29">filtering</a> give correct results.

Ordinary interpolation without premultiplied alpha leads to RGB information leaking out of fully transparent (A=0) regions, even though this RGB information is ideally invisible. When interpolating or filtering images with abrupt borders between transparent and opaque regions, this can result in borders of colors that were not visible in the original image. Errors also occur in areas of semitransparancy
because the RGB components are not correctly weighted, giving incorrectly high weighting to the color of the more transparent (lower alpha) pixels.

Premultiplication can reduce the available relative precision in the RGB values when using integer or fixed-point representation for the color components, which may cause a noticeable loss of quality if the color information is later brightened or if the alpha channel is removed. In practice, this is not usually noticeable because during typical composition operations, such as OVER, the influence of the low-precision colour information in low-alpha areas on the final output image (after composition) is correspondingly reduced. This loss of precision also makes premultiplied images easier to <a href="Data%20compression">compress</a> using certain compression schemes, as they do not record the color variations hidden inside transparent regions, and can allocate fewer bits to encode low-alpha areas.

With the existence of an alpha channel, it is possible to express compositing image operations using a "compositing algebra". For example, given two image elements A and B, the most common compositing operation is to combine the images such that A appears in the foreground and B appears in the background. This can be expressed as A over B. In addition to over, Porter and Duff defined the compositing operators in, held out by (usually abbreviated out), atop, and xor (and the reverse operators rover, rin, rout, and ratop) from a consideration of choices in blending the colors of two pixels when their coverage is, conceptually, overlaid orthogonally:

The over operator is, in effect, the normal painting operation (see <a href="Painter%27s%20algorithm">Painter's algorithm</a>). The in operator is the alpha compositing equivalent of <a href="Clipping%20%28computer%20graphics%29">clipping</a>.

As an example, the over operator can be accomplished by applying the following formula to each pixel value:

where formula_2 is the result of the operation, formula_3 is the color of the pixel in element A, formula_4 is the color of the pixel in element B, and formula_5 and formula_6 are the alpha of the pixels in elements A and B respectively. If it is assumed that all color values are premultiplied by their alpha values (formula_7), we can rewrite the equation for output color as:

and resulting alpha channel value is

Examples of red overlaid with green with both colours fully opaque:

Porter and Duff gave a geometric interpretation of the alpha compositing formula by studying orthogonal coverages. Another derivation of the formula, based on a physical <a href="reflectance">reflectance</a>/<a href="transmittance">transmittance</a> model, can be found in a 1981 paper by <a href="Bruce%20A.%20Wallace">Bruce A. Wallace</a>.

A third approach is found by starting out with two very simple assumptions. For simplicity, we shall here use the shorthand notation formula_10 for representing the over operator.

The first assumption is that in the case where the background is opaque (i.e. formula_11), the over operator represents the <a href="convex%20combination">convex combination</a> of formula_12 and formula_13:

The second assumption is that the operator must respect the associative rule:

Now, let us assume that formula_12 and formula_13 have variable transparencies, whereas formula_18 is opaque. We're interested in finding

We know from the associative rule that the following must be true:

We know that formula_18 is opaque and thus follows that formula_22 is opaque, so in the above equation, each formula_23 operator can be written as a convex combination:

Hence we see that this represents an equation of the form formula_25. By setting formula_26 and formula_27 we get

which means that we have analytically derived a formula for the output alpha and the output color of formula_10.

An even more compact representation is given by noticing that formula_30:

It is also interesting to note that the formula_23 operator fulfills all the requirements of a <a href="non-commutative">non-commutative</a> <a href="monoid">monoid</a>, where the <a href="identity%20element">identity element</a> formula_33 is chosen such that formula_34 (i.e. the identity element can be any tuple formula_35 with formula_36.)

Alpha blending is the process of combining a translucent foreground color with a background color, thereby producing a new blended color. The degree of the foreground color's translucency may range from completely transparent to completely opaque. If the foreground color is completely transparent, the blended color will be the background color. Conversely, if it is completely opaque, the blended color will be the foreground color. Of course, the translucency can range between these extremes, in which case the blended color is computed as a weighted average of the foreground and background colors.

Alpha blending is a <a href="convex%20combination">convex combination</a> of two <a href="color">color</a>s allowing for <a href="Transparency%20%28graphic%29">transparency</a> effects in <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a>. The value of codice_1 in the color code ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents a fully transparent color, and 1.0 represents a fully opaque color. This alpha value also corresponds to the ratio of "SRC over DST" in Porter and Duff equations.

The value of the resulting color is given by:

If the destination background is opaque, then formula_38, and if you enter it to the upper equation:

The alpha component may be used to blend to <a href="red">red</a>, <a href="green">green</a> and <a href="blue">blue</a> components equally, as in <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> <a href="RGBA%20color%20space">RGBA</a>, or, alternatively, there may be three alpha values specified corresponding to each of the <a href="primary%20color">primary color</a>s for <a href="spectral%20color">spectral color</a> <a href="filter%20%28optics%29">filtering</a>.

If pre-multiplied alpha is used, the above equations are simplified to:

Although used for similar purposes, <a href="Palette%20%28computing%29%23Transparent%20color%20in%20palettes">transparent color</a>s and <a href="Mask%20%28computing%29%23Image%20masks">image mask</a>s do not permit the smooth blending of the superimposed image pixels with those of the background (only whole image pixels or whole background pixels allowed).

A similar effect can be achieved with a 1-bit alpha channel, as found in the 16-bit RGBA <a href="Highcolor">Highcolor</a> mode of the <a href="Truevision%20TGA">Truevision TGA</a> <a href="image%20file%20format">image file format</a> and related <a href="TARGA">TARGA</a> and <a href="AT-Vista">AT-Vista</a>/<a href="NU-Vista">NU-Vista</a> display adapters' Highcolor graphic mode. This mode devotes 5 bits for every primary RGB color (<a href="List%20of%20monochrome%20and%20RGB%20palettes%2315-bit%20RGB">15-bit RGB</a>) plus a remaining bit as the "alpha channel".

Array data structure

In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a> consisting of a collection of "elements" (<a href="value%20%28computer%20science%29">values</a> or <a href="variable%20%28programming%29">variables</a>), each identified by at least one "array index" or "key". An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index <a href="tuple">tuple</a> by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

For example, an array of 10 32-bit integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">words</a> at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ... 2036, so that the element with index "i" has the address 2000 + 4 × "i".

The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address or foundation address.

Because the mathematical concept of a <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrix</a> can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the term "vector" is used in computing to refer to an array, although <a href="tuple">tuple</a>s rather than <a href="vector%20space">vectors</a> are more correctly the mathematical equivalent. Arrays are often used to implement <a href="table%20%28information%29">table</a>s, especially <a href="lookup%20table">lookup table</a>s; the word "table" is sometimes used as a synonym of "array".

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as <a href="list%20%28computing%29">list</a>s and <a href="string%20%28computer%20science%29">string</a>s. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many <a href="external%20storage">external storage</a> devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">Processors</a>, especially <a href="vector%20processor">vector processor</a>s, are often optimized for array operations.

Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at <a href="Run%20time%20%28program%20lifecycle%20phase%29">run time</a>. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative <a href="statement%20%28programming%29">statement</a> to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.

The term "array" is often used to mean <a href="array%20data%20type">array data type</a>, a kind of <a href="data%20type">data type</a> provided by most <a href="high-level%20programming%20language">high-level programming language</a>s that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by <a href="hash%20table">hash table</a>s, <a href="linked%20list">linked list</a>s, <a href="search%20tree">search tree</a>s, or other data structures.

The term is also used, especially in the description of <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s, to mean <a href="associative%20array">associative array</a> or "abstract array", a <a href="theoretical%20computer%20science">theoretical computer science</a> model (an <a href="abstract%20data%20type">abstract data type</a> or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.

The first digital computers used machine-language programming to set up and access array structures for data tables, vector and matrix computations, and for many other purposes. <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> wrote the first array-sorting program (<a href="merge%20sort">merge sort</a>) in 1945, during the building of the <a href="EDVAC">first stored-program computer</a>. Array indexing was originally done by <a href="self-modifying%20code">self-modifying code</a>, and later using <a href="index%20register">index register</a>s and <a href="Addressing%20mode">indirect addressing</a>. Some mainframes designed in the 1960s, such as the <a href="Burroughs%20large%20systems">Burroughs B5000</a> and its successors, used <a href="memory%20segmentation">memory segmentation</a> to perform index-bounds checking in hardware.

Assembly languages generally have no special support for arrays, other than what the machine itself provides. The earliest high-level programming languages, including <a href="Fortran">FORTRAN</a> (1957), <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a> (1958), <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> (1960), and <a href="ALGOL">ALGOL 60</a> (1960), had support for multi-dimensional arrays, and so has <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> (1972). In <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime as well as for runtime-flexible arrays.

Arrays are used to implement mathematical <a href="coordinate%20vector">vectors</a> and <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrices</a>, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables. Many <a href="database">database</a>s, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are <a href="record%20%28computer%20science%29">record</a>s.

Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, <a href="heap%20%28data%20structure%29">heaps</a>, <a href="hash%20table">hash table</a>s, <a href="double-ended%20queue">deque</a>s, <a href="queue%20%28data%20structure%29">queue</a>s, <a href="stack%20%28data%20structure%29">stacks</a>, <a href="String%20%28computer%20science%29">strings</a>, and <a href="VList">VList</a>s. Array-based implementations of other data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient (<a href="implicit%20data%20structure">implicit data structure</a>s), requiring little space <a href="Overhead%20%28computing%29">overhead</a>, but may have poor space complexity, particularly when modified, compared to tree-based data structures (compare a <a href="sorted%20array">sorted array</a> to a <a href="search%20tree">search tree</a>).

One or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program <a href="dynamic%20memory%20allocation">dynamic memory allocation</a>, particularly <a href="memory%20pool">memory pool</a> allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate "dynamic memory" portably.

Arrays can be used to determine partial or complete <a href="control%20flow">control flow</a> in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive) multiple codice_1 statements. They are known in this context as <a href="control%20table">control table</a>s and are used in conjunction with a purpose built interpreter whose <a href="control%20flow">control flow</a> is altered according to values contained in the array. The array may contain <a href="subroutine">subroutine</a> <a href="Pointer%20%28computer%20programming%29">pointers</a> (or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by <a href="Switch%20statement">SWITCH</a> statements) that direct the path of the execution.

When data objects are stored in an array, individual objects are selected by an index that is usually a non-negative <a href="scalar%20%28computing%29">scalar</a> <a href="integer">integer</a>. Indexes are also called subscripts. An index "maps" the array value to a stored object.

There are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed:


Arrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. For example, a two-dimensional array codice_2 with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression codice_3 in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional array, and "n" for an "n"-dimensional array.

The number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or <a href="rank%20%28computer%20programming%29">rank</a> of the array.

In standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some <a href="enumerated%20type">enumerated type</a>), and the address of an element is computed by a "linear" formula on the indices.

A one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array. Accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can either represent a row or column index.

As an example consider the C declaration codice_4

Syntax : datatype anArrayname[sizeofArray];

In the given example the array can contain 10 elements of any value available to the codice_5 type. In C, the array element indices are 0-9 inclusive in this case. For example, the expressions codice_6 and codice_7 are the first and last elements respectively.

For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index "i" is located at the address "B" + "c" × "i", where "B" is a fixed "base address" and "c" a fixed constant, sometimes called the "address increment" or "stride".

If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant "B" is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C programming language</a> specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element "<a href="Zero-based%20numbering">zeroth</a>" rather than "first".

However, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address "B". For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address "B" is replaced by "B" + 30"c", then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35. If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant "B" may not be the address of any element.

For multi dimensional array, the element with indices "i","j" would have address "B" + "c" · "i" + "d" · "j", where the coefficients "c" and "d" are the "row" and "column address increments", respectively.

More generally, in a "k"-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices "i", "i", ..., "i" is

For example: int a[2][3];

This means that array a has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the array is of integer type. Here we can store 6 elements they are stored linearly but starting from first row linear then continuing with second row. The above array will be stored as a, a, a, a, a, a.

This formula requires only "k" multiplications and "k" additions, for any array that can fit in memory. Moreover, if any coefficient is a fixed power of 2, the multiplication can be replaced by <a href="bitwise%20operation">bit shifting</a>.

The coefficients "c" must be chosen so that every valid index tuple maps to the address of a distinct element.

If the minimum legal value for every index is 0, then "B" is the address of the element whose indices are all zero. As in the one-dimensional case, the element indices may be changed by changing the base address "B". Thus, if a two-dimensional array has rows and columns indexed from 1 to 10 and 1 to 20, respectively, then replacing "B" by "B" + "c" - − 3 "c" will cause them to be renumbered from 0 through 9 and 4 through 23, respectively. Taking advantage of this feature, some languages (like FORTRAN 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical tradition while other languages (like Fortran 90, Pascal and Algol) let the user choose the minimum value for each index.

The addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension "d", the base address "B", and the increments "c", "c", ..., "c". It is often useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array's "descriptor" or "stride vector" or "<a href="dope%20vector">dope vector</a>". The size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed for each index may also be included in the dope vector. The dope vector is a complete <a href="handle%20%28computing%29">handle</a> for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to <a href="subroutine">procedures</a>. Many useful <a href="array%20slicing">array slicing</a> operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector.

Often the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous area of memory. However, that is not necessary. Even if arrays are always created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations may create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them.

There are two systematic compact layouts for a two-dimensional array. For example, consider the matrix
In the <a href="row-major%20order">row-major order</a> layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row:

In <a href="Row-major%20order">column-major order</a> (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column:

For arrays with three or more indices, "row major order" puts in consecutive positions any two elements whose index tuples differ only by one in the "last" index. "Column major order" is analogous with respect to the "first" index.

In systems which use <a href="processor%20cache">processor cache</a> or <a href="virtual%20memory">virtual memory</a>, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered. Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order. A programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use this information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each array. For example, when computing the product "A"·"B" of two matrices, it would be best to have "A" stored in row-major order, and "B" in column-major order.

Static arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed. However, by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it, it is possible to effectively implement a "dynamic" version of an array; see <a href="dynamic%20array">dynamic array</a>. If this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time.

Some array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a count of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or size. This effectively makes the array a <a href="dynamic%20array">dynamic array</a> with a fixed maximum size or capacity; <a href="Pascal%20string">Pascal string</a>s are examples of this.

More complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. For a compact two-dimensional <a href="triangular%20array">triangular array</a>, for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2.

Both "store" and "select" take (deterministic worst case) <a href="constant%20time">constant time</a>. Arrays take linear (<a href="Big-O%20notation">O</a>("n")) space in the number of elements "n" that they hold.

In an array with element size "k" and on a machine with a cache line size of B bytes, iterating through an array of "n" elements requires the minimum of ceiling("nk"/B) cache misses, because its elements occupy contiguous memory locations. This is roughly a factor of B/"k" better than the number of cache misses needed to access "n" elements at random memory locations. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called <a href="locality%20of%20reference">locality of reference</a> (this does "not" mean however, that using a <a href="Perfect%20hash%20function">perfect hash</a> or <a href="hash%20function%23Trivial%20hash%20function">trivial hash</a> within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in <a href="constant%20time">constant time</a>). Libraries provide low-level optimized facilities for copying ranges of memory (such as <a href="String.h">memcpy</a>) which can be used to move <a href="contiguous">contiguous</a> blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved through individual element access. The speedup of such optimized routines varies by array element size, architecture, and implementation.

Memory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element <a href="Computational%20overhead">overhead</a>. There may be a per-array overhead, e.g. to store index bounds, but this is language-dependent. It can also happen that elements stored in an array require "less" memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements can be stored in a single <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">word</a>; such arrays are often called "packed" arrays. An extreme (but commonly used) case is the <a href="bit%20array">bit array</a>, where every bit represents a single element. A single <a href="octet%20%28computing%29">octet</a> can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.

Array accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of <a href="data%20parallelism">data parallelism</a>.

<a href="Dynamic%20array">Growable array</a>s are similar to arrays but add the ability to insert and delete elements; adding and deleting at the end is particularly efficient. However, they reserve linear (<a href="Big-O%20notation%23Family%20of%20Bachmann%E2%80%93Landau%20notations">Θ</a>("n")) additional storage, whereas arrays do not reserve additional storage.

<a href="Associative%20array">Associative array</a>s provide a mechanism for array-like functionality without huge storage overheads when the index values are sparse. For example, an array that contains values only at indexes 1 and 2 billion may benefit from using such a structure. Specialized associative arrays with integer keys include <a href="Radix%20tree">Patricia trie</a>s, <a href="Judy%20array">Judy array</a>s, and <a href="van%20Emde%20Boas%20tree">van Emde Boas tree</a>s.

<a href="Self-balancing%20binary%20search%20tree">Balanced trees</a> require O(log "n") time for indexed access, but also permit inserting or deleting elements in O(log "n") time, whereas growable arrays require linear (Θ("n")) time to insert or delete elements at an arbitrary position.

<a href="Linked%20list">Linked list</a>s allow constant time removal and insertion in the middle but take linear time for indexed access. Their memory use is typically worse than arrays, but is still linear.
An <a href="Iliffe%20vector">Iliffe vector</a> is an alternative to a multidimensional array structure. It uses a one-dimensional array of <a href="reference%20%28computer%20science%29">references</a> to arrays of one dimension less. For two dimensions, in particular, this alternative structure would be a vector of pointers to vectors, one for each row. Thus an element in row "i" and column "j" of an array "A" would be accessed by double indexing ("A"["i"]["j"] in typical notation). This alternative structure allows <a href="jagged%20array">jagged array</a>s, where each row may have a different size — or, in general, where the valid range of each index depends on the values of all preceding indices. It also saves one multiplication (by the column address increment) replacing it by a bit shift (to index the vector of row pointers) and one extra memory access (fetching the row address), which may be worthwhile in some architectures.

The dimension of an array is the number of indices needed to select an element. Thus, if the array is seen as a function on a set of possible index combinations, it is the dimension of the space of which its domain is a discrete subset. Thus a one-dimensional array is a list of data, a two-dimensional array a rectangle of data, a three-dimensional array a block of data, etc.

This should not be confused with the dimension of the set of all matrices with a given domain, that is, the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with 5 rows and 4 columns is two-dimensional, but such matrices form a 20-dimensional space. Similarly, a three-dimensional vector can be represented by a one-dimensional array of size three.

Advance Australia Fair

"Advance Australia Fair" is the <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a> of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Created by the Scottish-born composer <a href="Peter%20Dodds%20McCormick">Peter Dodds McCormick</a>, the song was first performed in 1878 and sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It replaced "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen">God Save the Queen</a>" as the official national anthem in 1984, following a <a href="Australian%20plebiscite%2C%201977">plebiscite to choose the national song in 1977</a>. Other songs and marches have been influenced by "Advance Australia Fair", such as the Australian <a href="Honors%20music">vice-regal salute</a>.

"Advance Australia Fair" was composed in the late 19th century by <a href="Peter%20Dodds%20McCormick">Peter Dodds McCormick</a> under the pen-name "Amicus" (which means "friend" in Latin). It was first performed by Andrew Fairfax at a <a href="Highland%20Society%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Highland Society</a> function in Sydney on 30 November 1878. The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of around 10,000 at the inauguration of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Australia">Commonwealth of Australia</a> on 1 January 1901. In 1907 the Australian Government awarded McCormick £100 for his composition.

In a letter to R.B. Fuller, dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to write "Advance Australia Fair":

The earliest known sound recording of "Advance Australia Fair" appears in "The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt" (circa 1916), a short commercial recording dramatising the arrival of Australian troops in Egypt "en route" to Gallipoli.

Before its adoption as Australia's national anthem, "Advance Australia Fair" had considerable use elsewhere. For example, Australia's national broadcaster, the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Commission</a>, used it to announce its news bulletins until 1952. It was also frequently played at the start or end of official functions. Towards the end of World War II it was one of three songs played in certain picture theatres, along with "God Save the King" and the <a href="Star%20Spangled%20Banner">American national anthem</a>.

In 1951 there was a competition for a new national anthem to celebrate the golden jubilee of the <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation of Australia</a>. The entry by the Austrian-born conductor <a href="Henry%20Krips%20%28conductor%29">Henry Krips</a>, "This Land of Mine", won the competition but it was decided to make no change to the status quo.

Until 1974 "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen">God Save the Queen</a>" was Australia's national anthem. In 1973 the <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Whitlam</a> government decided that the country needed an anthem that could represent Australia with "distinction" and started a competition to find one. This decision by Whitlam was driven by the desire to forge a new nationalism separate from Great Britain. In 1973, Gough Whitlam dedicated an entire Australia Day speech to the search for a new anthem saying that it will be a "symbolic expression of our national pride and dignity". The <a href="Australia%20Council%20for%20the%20Arts">Australia Council for the Arts</a> organised the contest, which was dubbed the "Australian National Anthem Quest". The contest was held in two stages, the first seeking lyrics and the second music, each having an <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>5,000 prize for the winning entry. On the recommendation of the Council for the Arts, none of the new entries were felt worthy enough, so the contest ended with the suggestions for "Advance Australia Fair", "<a href="Waltzing%20Matilda">Waltzing Matilda</a>" and "<a href="Song%20of%20Australia">Song of Australia</a>".

In 1974 the Whitlam government then performed a nationwide opinion survey to determine the song to be sung on occasions of national significance. Conducted through the <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>, it polled 60,000 people nationally. "Advance Australia Fair" was chosen and was enshrined as the national song, to be used on all occasions excepting those of a specifically regal nature. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam stated that the Government regarded the tune primarily as the national anthem. During the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201975">1975 election campaign</a> following the <a href="1975%20Australian%20constitutional%20crisis">dismissal of Whitlam by Sir John Kerr</a>, it was proposed by <a href="David%20Combe">David Combe</a> that the song be played at the start of the Labor Party's official campaign launch on 24 November 1975 at Festival Hall, Melbourne. Whitlam's speechwriter <a href="Graham%20Freudenberg">Graham Freudenberg</a> rejected this idea, on two grounds, one of which was that the status of the anthem was still tentative.

In January 1976 the <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Fraser</a> government reinstated "God Save the Queen" for royal, vice-regal, defence and <a href="loyal%20toast">loyal toast</a> occasions as well as making plans to conduct a national poll to find a song for use on ceremonial occasions when it was desired to mark a separate Australian identity. This was conducted as a <a href="Australian%20plebiscite%2C%201977%20%28National%20Song%29">plebiscite to choose the National Song</a>, held as an optional additional question in the <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201977">1977 referendum</a> on various issues. "Advance Australia Fair" received 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives, "<a href="Waltzing%20Matilda">Waltzing Matilda</a>" (28.28%), "<a href="Song%20of%20Australia">Song of Australia</a>" (9.65%) and the existing national anthem, "God Save the Queen" (18.78%).

"Advance Australia Fair", with modified lyrics from the original (see <a href="%23Development%20of%20lyrics">development of lyrics</a>), was adopted as the Australian national anthem on 19 April 1984 by a proclamation by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a>, <a href="Ninian%20Stephen">Sir Ninian Stephen</a>, on a recommendation by the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government of <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>. "God Save the Queen", now known as the <a href="royal%20anthem">royal anthem</a>, continues to be played alongside the Australian national anthem at public engagements in Australia that are attended by <a href="Elizabeth%20II">the Queen</a> or members of the Royal Family

The lyrics of "Advance Australia Fair" were officially adopted in 1984 as follows:


Even though any <a href="copyright">copyright</a> of Peter Dodds McCormick's original lyrics has expired, as he died in 1916, the Commonwealth of Australia claims copyright on the official lyrics and particular arrangements of music. Non-commercial use of the anthem is permitted without case-by-case permission, but the Commonwealth government requires permission for commercial use.

The wordless orchestral version of "Advance Australia Fair" that is now regularly played for Australian victories at international sporting medal ceremonies, and at the openings of major domestic sporting, cultural and community events, is by <a href="Tommy%20Tycho">Tommy Tycho</a>, an immigrant from Hungary. It was first commissioned by ABC Records in 1984 and then televised by Channel 10 in 1986 in their Australia Day Broadcast, featuring <a href="Julie%20Anthony%20%28singer%29">Julie Anthony</a> as the soloist.

Since the original lyrics were written in 1879, there have been several changes, in some cases with the intent of increasing the anthem's inclusiveness and gender neutrality. Some of these were minor while others have significantly changed the song. The original song was four verses long. For its adoption as the national anthem, the song was cut from four verses to two. The first verse was kept largely as the 1879 original, except for the change in the first line from "Australia's sons let us rejoice" to "Australians all let us rejoice". The second, third and fourth verses of the original were dropped, in favour of a modified version of the new third verse which was sung at <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation</a> in 1901.

The original lyrics published in 1879 were as follows:



The 1901 Federation version of the third verse was originally sung as:


Both the lyrics and melody of the official anthem have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and unendearing to the Australian people. A <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">National Party</a> senator, <a href="Sandy%20Macdonald">Sandy Macdonald</a>, said in 2001 that "Advance Australia Fair" is so boring that the nation risks singing itself to sleep, with boring music and words impossible to understand. A parliamentary colleague, <a href="Peter%20Slipper">Peter Slipper</a>, said that Australia should consider another anthem. One suggested replacement was "<a href="I%20Am%20Australian">I Am Australian</a>", notably in 2011 by former Victorian Premier <a href="Jeff%20Kennett">Jeff Kennett</a>. 

Specific criticism is also directed at the fourth line of lyrics, "our home is girt by sea", for its use of the <a href="Archaism">archaic</a> word "<a href="wikt%3Agirt">girt</a>" to acknowledge the fact that Australia is an island. The current version of the anthem has a mix of old and new language, rather than having one style of language consistently throughout. Criticism has come from various people, including <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> politician <a href="Craig%20Emerson">Craig Emerson</a>, but others, including former Labor leader <a href="Kim%20Beazley">Kim Beazley</a>, have defended it.

The line "for we are young and free" has been criticised by a Victorian judge who said that many indigenous Australians find the words offensive. Australian Aboriginal soprano, <a href="Deborah%20Cheetham">Deborah Cheetham</a>, has refused to sing Advance Australia Fair at the AFL grand finals, citing this lyric, and has advocated for the lyrics to be rewritten.

A variant of the national anthem penned in 1988 by Sri Lankan immigrant Ruth Ponniah and sung in some Christian schools replaces the second verse with the following:

Automatic number announcement circuit

An automatic number announcement circuit (ANAC) is a component of a central office of a <a href="telephone%20company">telephone company</a> that provides a service to installation and service technicians to determine the <a href="telephone%20number">telephone number</a> of a <a href="local%20loop">line</a>. The facility has a telephone number that may be called to listen to an automatic announcement that includes the caller's telephone number.

The ANAC number is useful primarily during the installation of landline telephones to quickly identify one of multiple lines.

A technician calls the local telephone number of the automatic number announcement service. This call is connected to equipment at a local <a href="telephone%20exchange">central office</a> that uses a voice synthesizer or digital samples to <a href="text-to-speech">announce</a> the telephone number of the line calling in. The main purpose of this system is to allow telephone company technicians to identify the telephone line they are connected to.

Automatic number announcement systems are based on <a href="automatic%20number%20identification">automatic number identification</a>, and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with <a href="unlisted%20number">unlisted number</a>s, numbers with caller ID blocking, and numbers with no outgoing calls allowed. Installers of multi-line business services where outgoing calls from all lines display the company's main number on call display can use ANAC to identify a specific line in the system, even if CID displays every line as "line one".

Some ANACs are very regional or local in scope, while others are state-/province- or <a href="telephone%20numbering%20plan">area-code</a>-wide: there appears to be no consistent national system for them. Most are provider-specific. Every telephone company, whether large or small, determines its own ANAC for each individual central office, which tends to perpetuate the current situation of a mess of overlapping and/or spotty areas of coverage. No official lists of ANAC numbers are published as telephone companies believe overuse of these numbers could make them more likely to be busy when needed by installers.

Under the <a href="North%20American%20Numbering%20Plan">North American Numbering Plan</a>, almost all North American area codes reserve telephone numbers beginning with "958" and "959" for internal local and long distance testing (respectively), sometimes called plant testing. (One exception is <a href="Area%20code%20204">Winnipeg</a>, which reserves "959" only). Numbers within this block are used for various test utilities such as a <a href="ringback%20number">ringback number</a> (to test the ringer when installing <a href="telephone">telephone</a> sets), milliwatt tone (a number simply answers with a continuous <a href="test%20tone">test tone</a>) and a <a href="loop%20around">loop around</a> (which connects a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number). ANAC numbers can also appear in the "958" range, but there is no requirement that they reside there.

In some area codes, multiple additional prefixes had been reserved for test purposes, in addition to the standard 958 and 959. Many area codes reserved 999; 320 was also formerly reserved in <a href="Bell%20Canada">Bell Canada</a> territory. As widespread inefficiencies in numbering (such as the assignment of entire blocks of 10000 numbers to every competing carrier in every small village to support local number portability schemes) have created shortages of available numbers, these prefixes are often "reclaimed" and issued as standard exchanges, moving the handful of numbers in them to one standard test exchange (usually 958).

Some carriers have been known to disable <a href="payphone">payphone</a> calls to 958 or 959 test lines, such as Bell Canada's system-wide ANAC line at (area code) 958-2580. Conversely, a standard line on which voice service has been unsubscribed (such as an <a href="ADSL">ADSL</a> <a href="dry%20loop">dry loop</a>) may still accept calls to the 958 test exchange but not allow calls to standard numbers. This "soft disconnect" condition is intended to allow calls to <a href="9-1-1%23Inactive%20telephones">9-1-1 emergency services</a> and to the telco business office to order telephone service, but to no other numbers.

Some large telephone companies have <a href="toll-free%20number">toll-free number</a>s set up. In most cases, these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abuse, but MCI maintains this widely published, toll-free ANAC: 1-800-437-7950. This is distinct from technical support and other lines which use <a href="automatic%20number%20identification">ANI</a> so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a "<a href="screen%20pop">screen pop</a>" for the next available <a href="customer%20service">customer service</a> representative: the MCI number is intended specifically for ANAC use.

Formerly, some companies changed their ANAC number every month for secrecy; this is still the case with a few numbers. In one example of this concern, most payphones in the United States are assigned a telephone number and can ring if the number is called. The phone can then be used to make and receive calls by anyone, making it a potential tool in anonymous criminal activity such as <a href="narcotics%20trafficking">narcotics trafficking</a>. Where a payphone does not have any number listed on the unit, the number can be discovered by calling an ANAC service.

Late in the 20th century, <a href="caller%20ID">caller ID</a> and <a href="prepaid%20cellphone">prepaid cellphone</a> service became commonplace. These services being more easily <a href="exploit%20%28computer%20security%29">exploit</a>ed for criminal purposes, this type of abuse of payphones faded from concern. In Canada, this behaviour has always been more difficult. As a matter of course, incoming calls to payphones are disabled; furthermore, the Bell ANAC number is also disabled (although the telephone number is marked on the payphone itself as it is needed to report a non-working coin phone to <a href="6-1-1">6-1-1</a> repair service).

There are some private national toll-free numbers that use <a href="automatic%20number%20identification">ANI</a> and then have a computer read back the number that is calling, but these are not intended for use in identifying the customer's own phone number. They are used in order for the agent in the <a href="call%20center">call center</a> to confirm the phone the customer is calling from, so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a "<a href="screen%20pop">screen pop</a>" for the next available <a href="customer%20service">customer service</a> representative; they are distinct from purpose-made toll-free ANAC numbers. Regardless, if one were to call one of these numbers, listen for the number confirmation and hang up, they would in effect be using this system as if it were an ANAC.

One such toll-free service is one owned by MCI - 1-800-444-4444. This number (US only) is easy to remember and, when called, will read back the number after a very short message. A suspended (out of service) line or an incoming only line would not be able to reach any toll-free numbers.

These numbers appear on various lists circulated on-line, many from the 1980s and 1990s. Most were published years ago by <a href="Phrack">Phrack</a>, , the alt.2600 <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroup (as part of the <a href="FAQ">FAQ</a>) or <a href="phreaking">phone phreaks</a> and are now hopelessly outdated. The information is not reliable, as numbers change often. Many of the listed numbers no longer work.

The list is presented by area code, number and location. In some regions, there are several numbers, depending on the telephone company or the area code of the caller, as there can be several central offices serving some areas.

The <a href="North%20American%20Numbering%20Plan">North American Numbering Plan</a> reserves 958-XXXX and 1-NPA-959-XXXX for local and long-distance test numbers in almost all USA and Canadian area codes.

Frequently, a prefix outside the 958 or 959 range (such as 200, 997, 998, 999) was also listed as a test exchange, only to be reclaimed and issued as a block of standard numbers at a later date. NANPA's utilised codes report will indicate 'UA' (unassignable) for valid test prefixes; if a formerly 'UA' code newly appears on the available list or becomes an active exchange, any former test numbers from its time as a reserved prefix are presumed invalid and deprecated. <a href="N11%20code">N11</a> prefixes such as <a href="2-1-1">211</a>, <a href="3-1-1">311</a> and <a href="5-1-1">511</a> are also disappearing as test numbers as these codes are reassigned to local services such as city, community or highway information.


A few commonly-used 958 or 959 numbers for major incumbent landline carriers:

Numbers otherwise vary arbitrarily by locality:













"Please note that it is always preferable to call the local ANAC; only if the local ANAC number can not be called is it advisable to call a toll-free ANAC number. It is also preferable to call an open ANAC rather than the password-protected one given below."

"The below numbers are not true ANAC numbers; however, they do read back one's phone number. These numbers provide valuable services to the customers they serve; it is, therefore, inadvisable to misuse them."

The current use of exchange prefixes for each area code is listed by CNAC; if an exchange changes from "plant test" to reclaimed or active, any former test numbers with the associated prefix are invalidated. Commonly-used test numbers for major carriers include:

Additional plant test codes may be in use locally in some areas:

Occasionally, a number in an existing, standard local exchange in the area is used. These will incur a toll (and might not work) outside their home area. Some may be announcing <a href="caller%20ID">caller ID</a>, which is not the same as ANI. As standard local calls, they are not accessible from ADSL "dry loop", inbound-only or unsubscribed lines:

In <a href="Bell%20Canada">Bell Canada</a> territory, +1-areacode-320 was formerly reserved for 320-xxxx test numbers; these were moved to the 958-xxxx range and 320-xxxx reclaimed for use as a standard exchange. The use of N11 prefixes (such as 3-1-1) for test numbers is also deprecated as 3-1-1 now often reaches <a href="city%20hall">city hall</a> or municipal services while 2-1-1 is local community information.

Some lists erroneously mention 1-555-1313 as ANAC (506 New Brunswick). The purpose of +1-areacode-555-1313, a pay-per-use "name that number" reverse lookup information service introduced in the mid-1990s, differs from ANAC. ANAC announces the caller's own number; the reverse lookup gives the directory name for a listed telephone number input by the user. 555-1313 is one of the rare uses of <a href="555%20%28telephone%20number%29">555 (telephone number)</a> for other than the standard 555-1212 directory information line.


This service announces the line number on all <a href="Eir%20%28telecommunications%29">Eir</a> lines, including lines where calls are carried by another provider using <a href="carrier%20preselect">carrier preselect</a>.
The same number also works for <a href="Smart%20Telecom">Smart Telecom</a> lines provided by <a href="local-loop%20unbundling">local-loop unbundling</a>.

The number is called out without the leading 0. For example, 021 XXX XXXX is read back as "21 XXX XXXX".

There is also an extended ANAC service for identifying which carrier handles calls. Dialling these numbers will cause the local switch to announce which carrier the calls are being routed through for a specific category of calls.




Subscribers may also dial +64-8-320-1231 from overseas to test if the (CPN) Caller ID number is being passed on to New Zealand; this should announce the area code and local number as it appears on call display.

Amerigo Vespucci

Amerigo Vespucci (; March 9, 1454February 22, 1512) was an <a href="Italy%23Early_Modern">Italian</a> <a href="explorer">explorer</a>, <a href="financier">financier</a>, <a href="navigator">navigator</a> and <a href="cartographer">cartographer</a> who first demonstrated that <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from <a href="Voyages%20of%20Christopher%20Columbus">Columbus' voyages</a>, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to people of the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>.

Colloquially referred to as the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>, this second super continent came to be termed "<a href="Americas">Americas</a>", deriving <a href="Naming%20of%20the%20Americas">its name</a> from "Americus", the <a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latin</a> version of Vespucci's <a href="Given%20name">first name</a>.

Amerigo Vespucci was born and raised in <a href="Republic%20of%20Florence">Florence</a> on the <a href="Italian%20Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a>. He was the third son of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci, a Florentine <a href="notary">notary</a>, and Lisabetta Mini. The father of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci had the name Amerigo Vespucci also. 

Amerigo Vespucci was educated by his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican friar</a> of <a href="San%20Marco%2C%20Florence">the monastery of San Marco</a> in Florence. While his elder brothers were sent to the <a href="University%20of%20Pisa">University of Pisa</a> to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a <a href="mercantile">mercantile</a> life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial <a href="Medici%20bank">house of Medici</a>, headed by <a href="Lorenzo%20de%27%20Medici">Lorenzo de' Medici</a>. Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of <a href="Lorenzo%20di%20Pierfrancesco%20de%27%20Medici">Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici</a> who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492. In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a> (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion. 

In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop <a href="Juan%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20de%20Fonseca">Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca</a>, the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Crown of Castile</a> broke their monopoly deal with <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. Just around this time (1495–96), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville. Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardi's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies. After these were delivered, Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.

At the invitation of king <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Manuel I of Portugal</a>, Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of <a href="South%20America">South America</a> between 1499 and 1502. On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.

The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1504. In 1507, <a href="Martin%20Waldseem%C3%BCller">Martin Waldseemüller</a> produced a world map on which he named the new continent <a href="Americas">America</a> after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name, which is Americus. In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>' glory. However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the <a href="The%20Americas%23Etymology%20and%20naming">Soderini Letter</a>, could be fabrications, not by Vespucci, but by others.

In 1508, the position of chief of navigation of Spain ("piloto mayor de Indias") was created for Vespucci, with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.

Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime. "<a href="Mundus%20Novus">Mundus Novus</a>" (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502. "Mundus Novus" was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries. "Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi" (Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as "Lettera al Soderini" or just "Lettera", was a letter in Italian addressed to <a href="Piero%20Soderini">Piero Soderini</a>. Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German <a href="Martin%20Waldseem%C3%BCller">Martin Waldseemüller</a> in 1507 in "<a href="Cosmographiae%20Introductio">Cosmographiae Introductio</a>", a book on <a href="cosmography">cosmography</a> and <a href="geography">geography</a>, as "Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes" (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci).

On March 22, 1508, <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon">King Ferdinand</a> made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world. Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).
In the 18th century, three unpublished familiar letters from Vespucci to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered. One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the "four voyages". Another was written from <a href="Cap-Vert">Cape Verde</a> in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.

Some have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications. However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci. It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent <a href="Americas">America</a> on his world map of 1507 in <a href="Lorraine%20%28province%29">Lorraine</a>. Vespucci used a <a href="Latinization%20%28literature%29">Latinised</a> form of his name, "Americus Vespucius", in his <a href="Latin">Latin</a> writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form "America", according to the prevalent view. The book accompanying the map stated: "I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women". It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseemüller had named the continent after him.

The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources. At the moment, there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time. Some historians like Germán Arciniegas and Gabriel Camargo Pérez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.

Vespucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication.

The first and fourth voyages are perhaps fabulous, but the second and third are certain.

A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci, written to Soderini, of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498. However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery. Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of <a href="hammock">hammock</a>s and <a href="sweat%20lodge">sweat lodge</a>s.

About 1499–1500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with <a href="Alonso%20de%20Ojeda">Alonso de Ojeda</a> (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander. The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. After hitting land at the coast of what is now <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a> and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> and the <a href="Orinoco%20River">Orinoco River</a> and returning to Spain by way of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>. The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially

on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. However, that claim may be fraudulent, which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.

The last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by <a href="Gon%C3%A7alo%20Coelho">Gonçalo Coelho</a> in 1501–1502 in the service of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. Departing from <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, the fleet sailed first to <a href="Cap-Vert">Cape Verde</a> where they met two of <a href="Pedro%20%C3%81lvares%20Cabral">Pedro Álvares Cabral</a>'s ships returning from <a href="India">India</a>. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage. On reaching the coast of <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, they sailed south along the coast of <a href="South%20America">South America</a> to <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>'s bay. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Río de la Plata</a>, which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day <a href="Canan%C3%A9ia">Cananéia</a> at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.

After the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha</a> and <a href="Beta%20Centauri">Beta Centauri</a>, as well as the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Crux">Crux</a>, the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula. Although these <a href="star">star</a>s had been known to the ancient <a href="Greece">Greeks</a>, gradual <a href="precession%20%28astronomy%29">precession</a> had lowered them below the <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an horizon so that they had been forgotten. On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> or <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a> and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Vespucci's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504. Like his alleged first voyage, Vespucci's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place. The only source of information for the last voyage is the "Letter to Soderini", but as several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip. However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain <a href="Gon%C3%A7alo%20Coelho">Gonçalo Coelho</a>, very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition (Vespucci's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well. However, it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.

The letters caused controversy after Vespucci's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged Vespucci's reputation.

Vespucci was a cousin of the husband of <a href="Simonetta%20Vespucci">Simonetta Vespucci</a>. He married Maria Cerezo. One of the very few references to Amerigo's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512, giving his widow, Maria Cerezo a lifetime pension of ten thousand marvedis per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.

Not long after his return to Spain, Vespucci became a Spanish citizen. On March 22, 1508 he was made the <a href="pilot%20major">pilot major</a> of Spain by <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> in honor of his discoveries. Vespucci also ran a school for navigators in the Spanish <a href="Casa%20de%20Contrataci%C3%B3n">House of Trade</a>, based in Seville.

He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in <a href="Seville">Seville</a>, Spain.

Aristide Maillol

Aristide Joseph Bonaventure Maillol (; December 8, 1861 – September 27, 1944) was a French <a href="Sculpture">sculptor</a>, <a href="Painting">painter</a>, and <a href="printmaking">printmaker</a>.

Maillol was born in <a href="Banyuls-sur-Mer">Banyuls-sur-Mer</a>, <a href="Roussillon">Roussillon</a>. He decided at an early age to become a painter, and moved to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> in 1881 to study art. After several applications and several years of living with poverty, his enrollment in the <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Beaux-Arts">École des Beaux-Arts</a> was accepted in 1885, and he studied there under <a href="Jean-L%C3%A9on%20G%C3%A9r%C3%B4me">Jean-Léon Gérôme</a> and <a href="Alexandre%20Cabanel">Alexandre Cabanel</a>. His early paintings show the influence of his contemporaries <a href="Pierre%20Puvis%20de%20Chavannes">Pierre Puvis de Chavannes</a> and <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>.

Gauguin encouraged his growing interest in decorative art, an interest that led Maillol to take up <a href="tapestry">tapestry</a> design. In 1893 Maillol opened a tapestry workshop in Banyuls, producing works whose high technical and aesthetic quality gained him recognition for renewing this art form in France. He began making small <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a> sculptures in 1895, and within a few years his concentration on sculpture led to the abandonment of his work in tapestry.

In July 1896, Maillol married Clotilde Narcis, one of his employees at his tapestry workshop. Their only son, Lucian, was born that October.

Maillol’s first major sculpture, "A Seated Woman", was modeled after his wife. The first version (in the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>, New York) was completed in 1902, and renamed "La Méditerranée". Maillol, believing that "art does not lie in the copying of nature", produced a second, less naturalistic version in 1905. In 1902, the art dealer <a href="Ambroise%20Vollard">Ambroise Vollard</a> provided Maillol with his first exhibition.
The subject of nearly all of Maillol's mature work is the female body, treated with a <a href="Classicism">classical</a> emphasis on stable forms. The figurative style of his large bronzes is perceived as an important precursor to the greater simplifications of <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a>, and his serene classicism set a standard for European (and American) figure sculpture until the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

<a href="Josep%20Pla">Josep Pla</a> said of Maillol, "These archaic ideas, Greek, were the great novelty Maillol brought into the tendency of modern sculpture. What you need to love from the ancients is not the antiquity, it is the sense of permanent, renewed novelty, that is due to the nature and reason."

His important public commissions include a 1912 commission for a monument to <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a>, as well as numerous war memorials commissioned after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Maillol served as a juror with <a href="Prix%20Blumenthal%23Florence%20Meyer%20Blumenthal">Florence Meyer Blumenthal</a> in awarding the <a href="Prix%20Blumenthal">Prix Blumenthal</a> (1919–1954) a grant awarded to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

He made a series of <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> illustrations for an edition of <a href="Vergil">Vergil</a>'s "<a href="Eclogues">Eclogues</a>" published by <a href="Harry%20Graf%20Kessler">Harry Graf Kessler</a> in 1926–27. He also illustrated "<a href="Daphnis%20and%20Chloe">Daphnis and Chloe</a>" by <a href="Longus">Longus</a> (1937) and "Chansons pour elle" by <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Paul Verlaine</a> (1939).
He died in Banyuls at the age of eighty-three, in an automobile accident. While driving home during a thunderstorm, the car in which he was a passenger skidded off the road and rolled over. A large collection of Maillol's work is maintained at the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20Maillol">Musée Maillol</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, which was established by <a href="Dina%20Vierny">Dina Vierny</a>, Maillol's model and platonic companion during the last 10 years of his life. His home a few kilometers outside Banyuls, also the site of his final resting place, has been turned into a museum where a number of his works and sketches are displayed.

Three of his bronzes grace the grand staircase of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera House</a> in New York City: "Summer" (1910–11), "Venus Without Arms" (1920), and" Kneeling Woman: Monument to Debussy" (1950–55). The third is the artist's only reference to music, created for a monument at <a href="Saint-Germain-en-Laye">Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>'s birthplace.

Antonio Canova

Antonio Canova (; 1 November 1757 – 13 October 1822) was an <a href="Italians">Italian</a> <a href="Neoclassical%20sculpture">Neoclassical sculptor</a>, famous for his <a href="marble%20sculpture">marble sculpture</a>s. Often regarded as the greatest of the Neoclassical artists, his artwork was inspired by the <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> and the classical revival, but avoided the <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>tics of the former, and the cold artificiality of the latter.

In 1757, Antonio Canova was born in <a href="Possagno">Possagno</a> to Pietro Canova, a stonecutter. In 1761, his father died. A year later, his mother remarried. As such, in 1762, he was put into the care of his paternal grandfather Pasino Canova, who was a <a href="stonemasonry">stonemason</a>, owner of a <a href="quarry">quarry</a>, and was a "sculptor who specialized in altars with statues and low reliefs in late Baroque style". He led Antonio into the art of sculpting.

Before the age of ten, Canova began making models in clay, and carving marble. Indeed, at the age of nine, he executed two small shrines of <a href="Carrara%20marble">Carrara marble</a>, which are still extant. After these works, he appears to have been constantly employed under his grandfather.

In 1770, he was an apprentice for two years to <a href="Giuseppe%20Bernardi">Giuseppe Bernardi</a>, who was also known as 'Torretto'. Afterwards, he was under the tutelage of <a href="Giovanni%20Ferrari%20%28sculptor%29">Giovanni Ferrari</a> until he began his studies at the <a href="Accademia%20di%20Belle%20Arti%20di%20Venezia">Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia</a>. At the Academy, he won several prizes. During this time, he was given his first workshop within a monastery by some local monks.

The Senator Giovanni Falier commissioned Canova to produce statues of <a href="Orpheus">Orpheus</a> and <a href="Eurydice">Eurydice</a> for his garden – the Villa Falier at <a href="Asolo">Asolo</a>. The statues were begun in 1775, and both were completed by 1777. The pieces explify the late <a href="Rococo%20style">Rococo style</a>. On the year of its completion, both works were exhibited for the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Ascension">Feast of the Ascension</a> in Piazza S. Marco. Widely praised, the works won Canova his first renown among the Venetian elite.

In 1779, he opened his own studio at Calle Del Traghetto at S. Maurizio. At this time, Procurator Pietro Vettor Pisani commissioned Canova's first marble statue: a depiction of <a href="Daedalus">Daedalus</a> and <a href="Icarus">Icarus</a>. The statue inspired great admiration for his work at the annual art fair; Canova was paid for 100 gold zecchini for the completed work. At the base of the statue, Daedalus' tools are scattered about; these tools are also an allusion to Sculpture, of which the statue is a personification. With such an intention, there is suggestion that Daedalus is a portrait of Canova's grandfather Pasino.

Canova arrived in Rome, on 28 December 1780. Prior to his departure, his friends had applied to the Venetian senate for a pension. Successful in the application, the stipend allotted amounted to three hundred ducats, limited to three years.

While in Rome, Canova spent time studying and sketching the works of Michelangelo.

In 1781, Girolamo Zulian – the Venetian ambassador to Rome – hired Canova to sculpt "Theseus and the Minotaur". The statue depicts the victorious <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a> seated on the lifeless body of a <a href="Minotaur">Minotaur</a>. The initial spectators were certain that the work was a copy of a Greek original, and were shocked to learn it was a contemporary work. The highly regarded work is now in the collection of the <a href="Victoria%20%26amp%3B%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria & Albert Museum</a>, in London.

Between 1783 – 1785, Canova arranged, composed, and designed a funerary monument dedicated to <a href="Clement%20XIV">Clement XIV</a> for the <a href="Church%20of%20Santi%20Apostoli">Church of Santi Apostoli</a>. After another two years, the work met completion in 1787. The monument secured Canova's reputation as the pre-eminent living artist.

In 1792, he completed another cenotaph, this time commemorating <a href="Clement%20XIII">Clement XIII</a> for <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a>. Canova harmonized its design with the older Baroque funerary monuments in the basilica.

In 1790, he began to work on a funerary monument for Titian, which was eventually abandoned by 1795. During the same year, he increased his activity as a painter.

The following decade was extremely productive, beginning works such as "Hercules and Lichas", "Cupid and Psyche", "Hebe", "Tomb of <a href="Maria%20Christina%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Teschen">Duchess Maria Christina of Saxony-Teschen</a>", and "The Penitent Magdalene".

In 1797, he went to Vienna, but only a year later, in 1798, he returned to <a href="Possagno">Possagno</a> for a year.

By 1800, Canova was the most celebrated artist in Europe. He systematically promoted his reputation by publishing engravings of his works and having marble versions of plaster casts made in his workshop. He became so successful that he had acquired patrons from across Europe including France, England, Russia, Poland, Austria and Holland, as well as several members from different royal lineages, and prominent individuals. Among his patrons, <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> and his family was provided by Canova with much work, producing several depictions between 1803 and 1809. The most notable representations were that of "<a href="Napoleon%20as%20Mars%20the%20Peacemaker">Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker</a>", and "<a href="Venus%20Victrix%20%28Canova%29">Venus Victrix</a>" which was portrayal of <a href="Pauline%20Bonaparte">Pauline Bonaparte</a>.

"<a href="Napoleon%20as%20Mars%20the%20Peacemaker">Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker</a>" had its inception after Canova was hired to make a bust of Napoleon in 1802. The statue was begun in 1803, with Napoleon requesting to be shown in a French General's uniform, Canova rejected this, insisting on an allusion to <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a>, the <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman god</a> of <a href="War">War</a>. It was completed in 1806. In 1811, the statue arrived in Paris, but not installed; neither was its bronze copy in the Foro Napoleonico in Milan. In 1815, the original went to <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">the Duke of Wellington</a>, after his victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a> against Napoleon.

"<a href="Venus%20Victrix%20%28Canova%29">Venus Victrix</a>' was originally conceived as a robed and recumbent sculpture of <a href="Pauline%20Bonaparte">Pauline Borghese</a> in the guise of <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a>. Instead, Pauline ordered Canova to make the statue a nude Venus. The work was not intended for public viewing.

Other works for the Napoleon family include, a bust of Napoleon, a statue of Napoleon's mother, and <a href="Marie%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Parma">Marie Louise</a> as <a href="Concordia%20%28mythology%29">Concordia</a>.

In 1802, Canova was assigned the post of 'Inspector-General of Antiquities and Fine Art of the Papal State', a position formerly held by <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>. One of his activities in this capacity was to pioneer the restoration of the <a href="Appian%20Way">Appian Way</a> by restoring the tomb of Servilius Quartus. In 1808 Canova became an associated member of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Royal Institute of the Netherlands</a>.

In 1814, he began his "<a href="The%20Three%20Graces%20%28sculpture%29">The Three Graces</a>".

In 1815, he was named 'Minister Plenipotentiary of the Pope,' and was tasked with recovering various works of art that were taken to Paris by <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a>.

Also in 1815, he visited London, and met with <a href="Benjamin%20Haydon">Benjamin Haydon</a>. It was after the advice of Canova that the <a href="Elgin%20marbles">Elgin marbles</a> were acquired by the British Museum, with plaster copies sent to Florence, according to Canova's request.

In 1816, Canova returned to Rome with some of the art Napoleon had taken. He was rewarded with several marks of distinction: he was appointed President of the <a href="Accademia%20di%20San%20Luca">Accademia di San Luca</a>, inscribed into the "Golden Book of Roman Nobles" by the Pope's own hands, and given the title of Marquis of <a href="Ischia">Ischia</a>, alongside an annual pension of 3000 crowns.

In 1819, he commenced and completed his commissioned work "Venus Italica" as a replacement for the <a href="Venus%20de%27%20Medici">Venus de' Medici</a>.

After his 1814 proposal to build a personified statue of Religion for <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a> was rejected, Canova sought to build his own temple to house it. This project came to be the <a href="Tempio%20Canoviano">Tempio Canoviano</a>. Canova designed, financed, and partly built the structure himself. The structure was to be a testament to Canova's piety. The building's design was inspired by combining the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> and the <a href="Pantheon%2C%20Rome">Pantheon</a> together. On 11 July 1819, Canova laid the foundation stone dressed in red Papal uniform and decorated with all his medals. It first opened in 1830, and was finally completed in 1836. After the foundation-stone of this edifice had been laid, Canova returned to Rome; but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit Possagno to direct the workmen and encourage them with rewards.

During the period that intervened between commencing operations at Possagno and his death, he executed or finished some of his most striking works. Among these were the group "Mars and Venus", the colossal figure of <a href="Pius%20VI">Pius VI</a>, the <a href="Piet%C3%A0">Pietà</a>, the "St John", and a colossal bust of his friend, the Count Cicognara.
In 1820, he made a statue of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> for the state of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. As recommended by <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, the sculptor used the <a href="George%20Washington%20%28Ceracchi%29">marble bust of Washington</a> by <a href="Giuseppe%20Ceracchi">Giuseppe Ceracchi</a> as a model. It was delivered on December 24, 1821. The statue was later destroyed by fire in 1831. A plaster replica was sent by the king of Italy in 1910, now on view at the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Museum%20of%20History">North Carolina Museum of History</a>. A marble copy was sculpted by <a href="Romano%20Vio">Romano Vio</a> in 1970, now on view in the rotunda of the <a href="North%20Carolina%20State%20Capitol">capitol building</a>.

In 1822, he journeyed to Naples, to superintend the construction of wax moulds for an equestrian statue of <a href="Ferdinand%20VII">Ferdinand VII</a>. The adventure was disastrous to his health, but soon became healthy enough to return to Rome. From there, he voyaged to Venice; however, on 13 October 1822, he died there at the age of 64. As he never married, the name became extinct, except through his stepbrothers' lineage of Satori-Canova.

On 12 October 1822, Canova instructed his brother to use his entire estate to complete the Tempio in Possagno.

On 25 October 1822, his body was placed in the Tempio Canoviano. His heart was interred at the <a href="Basilica%20di%20Santa%20Maria%20Gloriosa%20dei%20Frari">Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari</a> in Venice, and his right hand preserved in a vase at the <a href="Accademia%20di%20Belle%20Arti%20di%20Venezia">Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia</a>.

His memorial service was so grand that it rivaled the ceremony that the city of Florence held for Michelangelo in 1564.

In 1826, Giovanni Battista Sartori sold Canova's Roman studio and took every plaster model and sculpture to Possagno, where they were installed in the <a href="Tempio%20Canoviano">Tempio Canoviano</a>.

Among Canova's most notable works are:

"<a href="Psyche%20Revived%20by%20Cupid%27s%20Kiss">Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss</a>" was commissioned in 1787 by <a href="John%20Campbell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Cawdor">Colonel John Campbell</a>. It is regarded as a masterpiece of Neoclassical sculpture, but shows the mythological lovers at a moment of great emotion, characteristic of the emerging movement of <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>. It represents the god <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a> in the height of love and tenderness, immediately after awakening the lifeless <a href="Psyche%20%28mortal%29">Psyche</a> with a kiss.

"<a href="Napoleon%20as%20Mars%20the%20Peacemaker">Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker</a>" had its inception after Canova was hired to make a bust of Napoleon in 1802. The statue was begun in 1803, with Napoleon requesting to be shown in a French General's uniform, Canova rejected this, insisting on an allusion to <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a>, the <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman god</a> of <a href="War">War</a>. It was completed in 1806. In 1811, the statue arrived in Paris, but not installed; neither was its bronze copy in the Foro Napoleonico in Milan. In 1815, the original went to <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">the Duke of Wellington</a>, after his victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a> against Napoleon.

"Perseus Triumphant", sometimes called "Perseus with the Head of Medusa", was a statue commissioned by tribune Onorato Duveyriez. It depicts the Greek hero <a href="Perseus">Perseus</a> after his victory over the <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a>.

The statue was based freely to the <a href="Apollo%20Belvedere">Apollo Belvedere</a> and the <a href="Medusa%20Rondanini">Medusa Rondanini</a>.

<a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, after his <a href="Italian%20campaigns%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">1796 Italian Campaign</a>, took the <a href="Apollo%20Belvedere">Apollo Belvedere</a> to Paris. In the statue's absence, <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pope Pius VII</a> acquired Canova's "Perseus Triumphant" and placed the work upon the "Apollo"'s pedestal. The statue was so successful that when the "Apollo" was returned, "Perseus" remained as a companion piece.

One replica of the statue was purchased from Canova by the Polish countess Valeria Tarnowska; it now resides in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

<a href="Karl%20Ludwig%20Fernow">Karl Ludwig Fernow</a> said of the statue that "every eye must rest with pleasure on the beautiful surface, even when the mind finds its hopes of high and pure enjoyment disappointed."

"<a href="Venus%20Victrix%20%28Canova%29">Venus Victrix</a>" ranks among the most famous of Canova's works. Originally, Canova wished the depictation to be of a robed <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a>, but <a href="Pauline%20Bonaparte">Pauline Borghese</a> insisted to appear as a nude Venus. The work was not intended for public viewing.

<a href="John%20Russell%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">John Russell</a>, the 6th <a href="Duke">Duke</a> of Bedford, commissioned a version of the now famous work. He had previously visited Canova in his studio in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in 1814 and had been immensely impressed by a carving of the Graces the sculptor had made for the <a href="Empress%20Josephine">Empress Josephine</a>. When the Empress died in May of the same year he immediately offered to purchase the completed piece, but was unsuccessful as Josephine’s son <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais">Eugène</a> claimed it (his son <a href="Maximilian%2C%20Duke%20of%20Leuchtenberg">Maximilian</a> brought it to <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>, where it can now be found in the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a>). Undeterred, the Duke commissioned another version for himself.

The sculpting process began in 1814 and was completed in 1817. Finally in 1819 it was installed at the Duke’s residence in <a href="Woburn%20Abbey">Woburn Abbey</a>. Canova even made the trip over to England to supervise its installation, choosing for it to be displayed on a <a href="pedestal">pedestal</a> adapted from a marble <a href="plinth">plinth</a> with a rotating top. This version is now owned jointly by the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> and the <a href="National%20Galleries%20of%20Scotland">National Galleries of Scotland</a>, and is alternately displayed at each.

Canova's sculptures fall into three categories: Heroic compositions, compositions of grace, and sepulchral monuments. In each of these, Canova's underlying artistic motivations were to challenge, if not compete, with classical statues.

Canova refused to take in pupils and students, but would hire workers to carve the initial figure from the marble. He had an elaborate system of comparative pointing so that the workers were able to reproduce the plaster form in the selected block of marble. These workers would leave a thin veil over the entire statue so Canova's could focus on the surface of the statue.

While he worked, he had people read to him select literary and historical texts.

During the last quarter of the eighteenth century, it became fashionable to view art galleries at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight. As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight, to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. After a little recarving, he began to rub the statue down with pumice stone, sometimes for period longer that weeks or months. If that was not enough, he would use <a href="Rotten%20stone">tripoli (rottenstone)</a> and <a href="lead">lead</a>.

He then applied a now unknown chemical-composition of <a href="patina">patina</a> onto the flesh of the figure to lighten the skin tone. Importantly, his friends also denied any usage of acids in his process.

Conversations revolving around the justification of art as superfluous usually invoked the name of Canova.

<a href="Karl%20Ludwig%20Fernow">Karl Ludwig Fernow</a> believed that Canova was not <a href="Kant">Kant</a>ian enough in his aesthetic, because <a href="Critique%20of%20Judgment">emphasis seemed to have been placed on agreeableness rather than Beauty</a>.

Canova was also faulted for creating works that were artificial in complexity.

Canova spent large parts of his fortune helping young students and sending patrons to struggling sculptors, including Sir <a href="Richard%20Westmacott">Richard Westmacott</a> and <a href="John%20Gibson%20%28sculptor%29">John Gibson</a>.

He was introduced into various orders of <a href="chivalry">chivalry</a>.

The <a href="Romantic%20period">Romantic period</a> artists buried Canova's name soon after he died, but he is slowly being rediscovered.

Auguste Rodin

François Auguste René Rodin (12 November 1840 – 17 November 1917), known as Auguste Rodin (; ), was a French <a href="Sculpture">sculptor</a>. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition, although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art.

Sculpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in <a href="clay">clay</a>. Many of his most notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of <a href="mythology">mythology</a> and <a href="allegory">allegory</a>, modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.

From the unexpected realism of his first major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281900%29">World's Fair</a> exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.

Rodin was born in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police department clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age ten. Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended the "Petite École", a school specializing in art and mathematics, where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher, <a href="Horace%20Lecoq%20de%20Boisbaudran">Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran</a>, believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections. Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite École that he first met <a href="Jules%20Dalou">Jules Dalou</a> and <a href="Alphonse%20Legros">Alphonse Legros</a>.
In 1857, Rodin submitted a clay model of a companion to the <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Beaux-Arts">École des Beaux-Arts</a> in an attempt to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the "Grande École" were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the "Petite École" in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.

Rodin's sister Maria, two years his senior, died of <a href="peritonitis">peritonitis</a> in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty because he had introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the <a href="Congregation%20of%20the%20Blessed%20Sacrament">Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament</a>. Saint <a href="Peter%20Julian%20Eymard">Peter Julian Eymard</a>, founder and head of the congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor <a href="Antoine-Louis%20Barye">Antoine-Louis Barye</a>. The teacher's attention to detail – his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion – significantly influenced Rodin.

In 1864, Rodin began to live with a young seamstress named <a href="Rose%20Beuret">Rose Beuret</a> (born in June 1844), with whom he would stay – with ranging commitment – for the rest of his life. The couple had a son, Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition, and entered the studio of <a href="Albert-Ernest%20Carrier-Belleuse">Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse</a>, a successful mass producer of "<a href="objets%20d%27art">objets d'art</a>". Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, Rodin was called to serve in the <a href="National%20Guard%20%28France%29">National Guard</a>, but his service was brief due to his <a href="near-sightedness">near-sightedness</a>. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family; poverty was a continual difficulty for Rodin until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked Rodin to join him in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, where they would work on ornamentation for the <a href="Brussels%20Stock%20Exchange">Brussels Stock Exchange</a>.

Rodin planned to stay in Belgium a few months, but he spent the next six years outside of France. It was a pivotal time in his life. He had acquired skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which sat in his workshop, since he could not afford castings. Though his relationship with Carrier-Belleuse deteriorated, Rodin found other employment in Brussels, displaying some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there. Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of <a href="Donatello">Donatello</a> and <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>. Their work had a profound effect on his artistic direction. Rodin said, "It is <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> who has freed me from academic sculpture." Returning to Belgium, he began work on "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Bronze">The Age of Bronze</a>", a life-size male figure whose realism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheating—its realism and scale was such that critics alleged he had cast the work from a living model. Much of Rodin's later work was explicitly larger or smaller than life, in part to demonstrate the folly of such accusations.

Rose Beuret and Rodin returned to Paris in 1877, moving into a small flat on the <a href="Rive%20Gauche">Left Bank</a>. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had wanted to see her son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Thérèse. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Thérèse's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son now joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. The charges of fakery surrounding "The Age of Bronze" continued. Rodin increasingly sought more soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.

Rodin earned his living collaborating with more established sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and <a href="neo-baroque">neo-baroque</a> architectural pieces in the style of <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Carpeaux">Carpeaux</a>. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of <a href="Denis%20Diderot">Denis Diderot</a>, <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, and <a href="Lazare%20Carnot">Lazare Carnot</a>, all to no avail. On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, "St. John the Baptist Preaching".

In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse – now art director of the <a href="S%C3%A8vres">Sèvres</a> national <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a> factory – offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.

The artistic community appreciated his work in this vein, and Rodin was invited to <a href="Paris%20Salon">Paris Salon</a>s by such friends as writer <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Cladel">Léon Cladel</a>. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known. French statesman <a href="Leon%20Gambetta">Leon Gambetta</a> expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.

Rodin's relationship with Turquet was rewarding: through him, he won the 1880 commission to create a <a href="Portal%20%28architecture%29">portal</a> for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate "<a href="Gates%20of%20Hell">Gates of Hell</a>", an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, "<a href="The%20Thinker">The Thinker</a>" and "<a href="The%20Kiss%20%28Rodin%20sculpture%29">The Kiss</a>". With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.

In 1883, Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor <a href="Alfred%20Boucher">Alfred Boucher</a> in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old <a href="Camille%20Claudel">Camille Claudel</a>. The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically. Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures, and she was a talented sculptor, assisting him on commissions.

Although busy with "The Gates of Hell", Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of <a href="Calais">Calais</a>. For a monument to French author <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a>, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.

In 1889, the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury. Though Rodin's career was on the rise, Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodin's "double life". Claudel and Rodin shared an <a href="wikt%3Aatelier">atelier</a> at a small old castle, but Rodin refused to relinquish his ties to Beuret, his loyal companion during the lean years, and mother of his son. During one absence, Rodin wrote to Beuret, "I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices...I remain, in all tenderness, your Rodin." 

Claudel and Rodin parted in 1898. Claudel suffered an alleged nervous breakdown several years later and was confined to an institution for 30 years by her family, until her death in 1943, despite numerous attempts by doctors to explain to her mother and <a href="Paul%20Claudel">brother</a> that she was sane.

In 1864, Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition, "The Man with the Broken Nose", to the <a href="Paris%20Salon">Paris Salon</a>. The subject was an elderly neighbourhood street porter. The unconventional <a href="bronze">bronze</a> piece was not a traditional <a href="bust%20%28sculpture%29">bust</a>, but instead the head was "broken off" at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, and the back of the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the "unfinishedness" that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures. The Salon rejected the piece.

In Brussels, Rodin created his first full-scale work, "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Bronze">The Age of Bronze</a>", having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelo's "<a href="Dying%20Slave">Dying Slave</a>", which Rodin had observed at the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.

In 1877, the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon. The statue's apparent lack of a theme was troubling to critics – commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event – and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme. He first titled the work "The Vanquished", in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles. After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on "The Age of Bronze", suggesting the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, and in Rodin's words, "man arising from nature". Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind "just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject".

Its mastery of form, light, and shadow made the work look so realistic that Rodin was accused of "surmoulage" – having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to "a statue of a sleepwalker" and called it "an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type". Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and "The Age of Bronze" was purchased by the state for 2,200 <a href="franc">franc</a>s – what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.
A second male nude, "<a href="Saint%20John%20the%20Baptist%20%28Rodin%29">St. John the Baptist Preaching</a>", was completed in 1878. Rodin sought to avoid another charge of "surmoulage" by making the statue larger than life: "St. John" stands almost 6' 7"<nowiki>"</nowiki> (2 m). While "The Age of Bronze" is statically posed, "St. John" gestures and seems to move toward the viewer. The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground – a physical impossibility, and a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics. Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, "display simultaneously...views of an object which in fact can be seen only successively".

Despite the title, "St. John the Baptist Preaching" did not have an obviously religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.

Regardless of the immediate receptions of "St. John" and "The Age of Bronze", Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame. Students sought him at his studio, praising his work and scorning the charges of "surmoulage". The artistic community knew his name.

A commission to create a <a href="Gate">portal</a> for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on "<a href="The%20Gates%20of%20Hell">The Gates of Hell</a>", a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante's</a> "<a href="The%20Divine%20Comedy">Inferno</a>" in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.

He conceived "The Gates" with the "surmoulage" controversy still in mind: "...I had made the "St. John" to refute [the charges of casting from a model], but it only partially succeeded. To prove completely that I could model from life as well as other sculptors, I determined...to make the sculpture on the door of figures smaller than life." Laws of composition gave way to the "Gates"' disordered and untamed depiction of Hell. The figures and groups in this, Rodin's meditation on the condition of man, are physically and morally isolated in their torment.

"The Gates of Hell" comprised 186 figures in its final form. Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as "<a href="The%20Thinker">The Thinker</a>", "The Three Shades", and "The Kiss", and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from "The Gates" are "<a href="Ugolino%20della%20Gherardesca">Ugolino</a>", "<a href="Caryatid">Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone</a>", "Fugit Amor", "She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife", "The Falling Man", and "The Prodigal Son".
"The Thinker" (originally titled "The Poet", after Dante) was to become one of the most well-known sculptures in the world. The original was a high bronze piece created between 1879 and 1889, designed for the "Gates"<nowiki>'</nowiki> <a href="lintel">lintel</a>, from which the figure would gaze down upon Hell. While "The Thinker" most obviously characterizes Dante, aspects of the Biblical <a href="Adam">Adam</a>, the mythological <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>, and Rodin himself have been ascribed to him. Other observers de-emphasize the apparent intellectual theme of "The Thinker", stressing the figure's rough physicality and the emotional tension emanating from it.

The town of Calais had contemplated a historical monument for decades when Rodin learned of the project. He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens.

During the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>, the army of <a href="King%20Edward%20III">King Edward III</a> besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's population be killed "en masse". He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, <a href="Philippa%20of%20Hainault">Philippa of Hainault</a>, begged him to spare their lives. "<a href="The%20Burghers%20of%20Calais">The Burghers of Calais</a>" depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.

Rodin began the project in 1884, inspired by the chronicles of the siege by <a href="Jean%20Froissart">Jean Froissart</a>. Though the town envisioned an <a href="allegorical">allegorical</a>, heroic piece centered on Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the eldest of the six men, Rodin conceived the sculpture as a study in the varied and complex emotions under which all six men were laboring. One year into the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin's progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee's conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.

In 1889, "The Burghers of Calais" was first displayed to general acclaim. It is a bronze sculpture weighing two tons (1,814 kg), and its figures are 6.6 ft (2 m) tall. The six men portrayed do not display a united, heroic front; rather, each is isolated from his brothers, individually deliberating and struggling with his expected fate. Rodin soon proposed that the monument's high pedestal be eliminated, wanting to move the sculpture to ground level so that viewers could "penetrate to the heart of the subject". At ground level, the figures' positions lead the viewer around the work, and subtly suggest their common movement forward.

The committee was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having "Burghers" displayed in their preferred form: the work was placed in front of a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.

Commissioned to create a monument to French writer <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> in 1889, Rodin dealt extensively with the subject of "artist and muse". Like many of Rodin's public commissions, "Monument to Victor Hugo" was met with resistance because it did not fit conventional expectations. Commenting on Rodin's monument to Victor Hugo, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in 1909 expressed that "there is some show of reason in the complaint that [Rodin's] conceptions are sometimes unsuited to his medium, and that in such cases they overstrain his vast technical powers". The 1897 plaster model was not cast in bronze until 1964.

The "Société des Gens des Lettres", a Parisian organization of writers, planned a monument to French novelist <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> immediately after his death in 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a <a href="frock%20coat">frock coat</a>, or in a <a href="robe">robe</a> – a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work – to express courage, labor, and struggle.

When "Balzac" was exhibited in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The "Société" rejected the work, and the press ran <a href="parodies">parodies</a>. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, "there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem "outre" to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang." A modern critic, indeed, indicates that "Balzac" is one of Rodin's masterpieces.

The monument had its supporters in Rodin's day; a manifesto defending him was signed by <a href="Monet">Monet</a>, <a href="Debussy">Debussy</a>, and future <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20France">Premier</a> <a href="Georges%20Clemenceau">Georges Clemenceau</a>, among many others. In the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> series <a href="Civilisation%20%28TV%20series%29">Civilisation</a>, art historian <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> praised the monument as "the greatest piece of sculpture of the 19th Century, perhaps, indeed, the greatest since <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>." Rather than try to convince skeptics of the merit of the monument, Rodin repaid the "Société" his commission and moved the figure to his garden. After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was "<a href="Monument%20to%20Balzac">Monument to Balzac</a>" cast in bronze and placed on the <a href="Boulevard%20du%20Montparnasse">Boulevard du Montparnasse</a> at the intersection with <a href="Boulevard%20Raspail">Boulevard Raspail</a>.

The popularity of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of busts, figures, and sculptural fragments over more than five decades. He painted in <a href="Oil%20painting">oils</a> (especially in his thirties) and in <a href="Watercolor%20painting">watercolors</a>. The Musée Rodin holds 7,000 of his drawings and prints, in <a href="chalk">chalk</a> and <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>, and thirteen vigorous <a href="drypoint">drypoint</a>s. He also produced a single <a href="lithograph">lithograph</a>.

Portraiture was an important component of Rodin's oeuvre, helping him to win acceptance and financial independence. His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917. Early subjects included fellow sculptor <a href="Jules%20Dalou">Jules Dalou</a> (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884).

Later, with his reputation established, Rodin made busts of prominent contemporaries such as English politician <a href="George%20Wyndham">George Wyndham</a> (1905), Irish playwright <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> (1906), Socialist and former mistress of the Prince of Wales who became King Edward VII <a href="Daisy%20Greville%2C%20Countess%20of%20Warwick">Countess of Warwick</a> (1908), Austrian composer <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a> (1909), former Argentinian president <a href="Domingo%20Faustino%20Sarmiento">Domingo Faustino Sarmiento</a> and French statesman <a href="Georges%20Clemenceau">Georges Clemenceau</a> (1911).

His undated drawing "Study of a Woman Nude, Standing, Arms Raised, Hands Crossed Above Head" is one of the <a href="2012%20Munich%20artworks%20discovery">works seized in 2012 from Cornelius Gurlitt</a>.

Rodin was a naturalist, less concerned with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, he turned away from the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> and <a href="Baroque%20Revival%20architecture">neo-Baroque</a> movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.

Rodin's talent for surface modeling allowed him to let every part of the body speak for the whole. The male's passion in "The Thinker" is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands. Speaking of "The Thinker", Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: "What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes."

Sculptural fragments to Rodin were autonomous works, and he considered them the essence of his artistic statement. His fragments – perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head – took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are "<a href="The%20Walking%20Man">The Walking Man</a>", "Meditation without Arms", and "Iris, Messenger of the Gods".

Rodin saw suffering and conflict as hallmarks of modern art. "Nothing, really, is more moving than the maddened beast, dying from unfulfilled desire and asking in vain for grace to quell its passion." <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</a> echoed those themes, and was among Rodin's favorite poets. Rodin enjoyed music, especially the opera composer <a href="Gluck">Gluck</a>, and wrote a book about <a href="List%20of%20cathedrals%20in%20France">French cathedrals</a>. He owned a work by the as-yet-unrecognized <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Van Gogh</a>, and admired the forgotten <a href="El%20Greco">El Greco</a>.

Instead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred his models to move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin's focus was on the handling of clay.

George Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodin's technique: "While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles. At the end of the first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work."

He described the evolution of his bust over a month, passing through "all the stages of art's evolution": first, a "<a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> masterpiece", then "<a href="Bernini">Bernini</a> intermingled", then an elegant <a href="Houdon">Houdon</a>. "The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works, but as the work of "<a href="Elan%20Vital%20%28term%29">Elan Vital</a>". The "Hand of God" is his own hand."

After he completed his work in clay, he employed highly skilled assistants to re-sculpt his compositions at larger sizes (including any of his large-scale monuments such as "The Thinker"), to cast the clay compositions into plaster or bronze, and to carve his marbles. Rodin's major innovation was to capitalize on such multi-staged processes of 19th century sculpture and their reliance on plaster casting.

Since clay deteriorates rapidly if not kept wet or fired into a terra-cotta, sculptors used plaster casts as a means of securing the composition they would make from the fugitive material that is clay. This was common practice amongst Rodin's contemporaries, and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material. Rodin, however, would have multiple plasters made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture, recombining their parts and figures into new compositions, and new names.

As Rodin's practice developed into the 1890s, he became more and more radical in his pursuit of fragmentation, the combination of figures at different scales, and the making of new compositions from his earlier work. A prime example of this is the bold "<a href="The%20Walking%20Man">The Walking Man</a>" (1899–1900), which was exhibited as his major one-person show in 1900. This is composed of two sculptures from the 1870s that Rodin found in his studio – a broken and damaged torso that had fallen into neglect and the lower extremities of a statuette version of his 1878 "St. John the Baptist Preaching" he was having re-sculpted at a reduced scale.

Without finessing the join between upper and lower, between torso and legs, Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works. This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles, exhibits two different attitudes toward finish, and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components. It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practices – along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose, sensual subject matter, and non-realistic surface – that marked Rodin's re-making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture.

By 1900, Rodin's artistic reputation was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set up near the 1900 <a href="World%27s%20Fair">World's Fair</a> ("Exposition Universelle") in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a>, and authors <a href="Octave%20Mirbeau">Octave Mirbeau</a>, <a href="Joris-Karl%20Huysmans">Joris-Karl Huysmans</a>, and <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>.

Rilke stayed with Rodin in 1905 and 1906, and did administrative work for him; he would later write a laudatory <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret's modest country estate in <a href="Meudon">Meudon</a>, purchased in 1897, was a host to such visitors as <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward</a>, dancer <a href="Isadora%20Duncan">Isadora Duncan</a>, and <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>ist <a href="Wanda%20Landowska">Wanda Landowska</a>. Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting the main floor of the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Biron">Hôtel Biron</a>, an 18th-century townhouse. He left Beuret in Meudon, and began an affair with the American-born Duchesse de Choiseul. From 1910, he mentored the Russian sculptor, <a href="Moissey%20Kogan">Moissey Kogan</a>.

While Rodin was beginning to be accepted in France by the time of "The Burghers of Calais", he had not yet conquered the American market. Because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work, he did not have an easy time selling his work to American industrialists. Fortunately, he came to know <a href="Sarah%20Tyson%20Hallowell">Sarah Tyson Hallowell</a> (1846–1924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier <a href="Potter%20Palmer">Potter Palmer</a> and his wife, <a href="Bertha%20Palmer">Bertha Palmer</a> (1849–1918).

The next opportunity for Rodin in America was the 1893 <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">Chicago World's Fair</a>. Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was "beaucoup moins beau que l'original" but impossible, outside the rules. Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection. Rodin sent Hallowell three works, "Cupid and Psyche", "Sphinx" and "Andromeda". All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.

Fortunately, "Bust of Dalou" and "Burgher of Calais" were on display in the official French pavilion at the fair and so between the works that were on display and those that were not, he was noticed. However, the works he gave Hallowell to sell found no takers, but she soon brought the controversial Quaker-born financier <a href="Charles%20Yerkes">Charles Yerkes</a> (1837–1905) into the fold and he purchased two large marbles for his Chicago manse; Yerkes was likely the first American to own a Rodin sculpture.

Other collectors soon followed including the tastemaking Potter Palmers of Chicago and <a href="Isabella%20Stewart%20Gardner">Isabella Stewart Gardner</a> (1840–1924) of Boston, all arranged by Sarah Hallowell. In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market, Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze, a marble and a terra cotta. When Hallowell moved to Paris in 1893, she and Rodin continued their warm friendship and correspondence, which lasted to the end of the sculptor's life. After Hallowell's death, her niece, the painter <a href="Harriet%20Hallowell">Harriet Hallowell</a>, inherited the Rodins and after her death, the American heirs could not manage to match their value in order to export them, so they became the property of the French state.

After the start of the 20th century, Rodin was a regular visitor to Great Britain, where he developed a loyal following by the beginning of the First World War. He first visited England in 1881, where his friend, the artist <a href="Alphonse%20Legros">Alphonse Legros</a>, had introduced him to the poet <a href="William%20Ernest%20Henley">William Ernest Henley</a>. With his personal connections and enthusiasm for Rodin's art, Henley was most responsible for Rodin's reception in Britain. (Rodin later returned the favor by sculpting a that was used as the frontispiece to Henley's collected works and, after his death, on his monument in London.)

Through Henley, Rodin met <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a> and <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a>, in whom he found further support. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a significant selection of his works to the nation in 1914.

After the revitalization of the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20des%20Beaux-Arts">Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts</a> in 1890, Rodin served as the body's vice-president. In 1903, Rodin was elected president of the <a href="International%20Society%20of%20Sculptors%2C%20Painters%20and%20Gravers">International Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers</a>. He replaced its former president, <a href="James%20Abbott%20McNeill%20Whistler">James Abbott McNeill Whistler</a>, upon Whistler's death. His election to the prestigious position was largely due to the efforts of <a href="Albert%20Ludovici">Albert Ludovici</a>, father of English philosopher <a href="Anthony%20Ludovici">Anthony Ludovici</a>, who was private secretary to Rodin for several months in 1906, but the two men parted company after Christmas, "to their mutual relief."

During his later creative years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous <a href="Erotic%20art">erotic drawings</a>, sketched in a loose way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his eyes from the model. Rodin met American dancer <a href="Isadora%20Duncan">Isadora Duncan</a> in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.
Fifty-three years into their relationship, Rodin married Rose Beuret. The wedding was 29 January 1917, and Beuret died two weeks later, on 16 February. Rodin was ill that year; in January, he suffered weakness from <a href="influenza">influenza</a>, and on 16 November his physician announced that "congestion of the lungs has caused great weakness. The patient's condition is grave." Rodin died the next day, age 77, at his villa in <a href="Meudon">Meudon</a>, <a href="%C3%8Ele-de-France">Île-de-France</a>, on the outskirts of Paris.

A cast of "The Thinker" was placed next to his tomb in Meudon; it was Rodin's wish that the figure served as his <a href="headstone">headstone</a> and <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a>. In 1923, Marcell Tirel, Rodin's secretary, published a book alleging that Rodin's death was largely due to cold, and the fact that he had no heat at Meudon. Rodin requested permission to stay in the <a href="Hotel%20Biron">Hotel Biron</a>, a museum of his works, but the director of the museum refused to let him stay there.

Rodin willed to the French state his studio and the right to make casts from his plasters. Because he encouraged the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin's sculptures are represented in many public and private collections. The <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20Rodin">Musée Rodin</a> was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Biron">Hôtel Biron</a>, where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 works on paper. The French order "<a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>" made him a Commander, and he received an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>.

During his lifetime, Rodin was compared to <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era. In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values. Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended; he is recognized as the most important sculptor of the modern era, and has been the subject of much scholarly work. The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as "The Walking Man", influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.

Rodin restored an ancient role of sculpture – to capture the physical and intellectual force of the human subject – and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women – to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as "The Kiss" and "The Thinker", are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the <a href="Google">Google</a> search engine homepage displayed a <a href="Google%20Doodle">Google Doodle</a> featuring "The Thinker" to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.

Rodin had enormous artistic influence. A whole generation of sculptors studied in his workshop. These include <a href="Gutzon%20Borglum">Gutzon Borglum</a>, <a href="Antoine%20Bourdelle">Antoine Bourdelle</a>, <a href="Constantin%20Brancusi">Constantin Brancusi</a>, <a href="Camille%20Claudel">Camille Claudel</a>, <a href="Charles%20Despiau">Charles Despiau</a>, <a href="Malvina%20Hoffman">Malvina Hoffman</a>, <a href="Carl%20Milles">Carl Milles</a>, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pompon">François Pompon</a>, <a href="Rodo">Rodo</a>, <a href="Gustav%20Vigeland">Gustav Vigeland</a>, and <a href="Clara%20Westhoff">Clara Westhoff</a>, even though Brancusi later rejected his legacy. Rodin also promoted the work of other sculptors, including <a href="Aristide%20Maillol">Aristide Maillol</a> and <a href="Ivan%20Me%C5%A1trovi%C4%87">Ivan Meštrović</a> whom Rodin once called "the greatest phenomenon amongst sculptors." Other sculptors whose work has been described as owing to Rodin include <a href="Joseph%20Csaky">Joseph Csaky</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Archipenko">Alexander Archipenko</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Bernard">Joseph Bernard</a>, <a href="Henri%20Gaudier-Brzeska">Henri Gaudier-Brzeska</a>, <a href="Georg%20Kolbe">Georg Kolbe</a>, <a href="Wilhelm%20Lehmbruck">Wilhelm Lehmbruck</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Lipchitz">Jacques Lipchitz</a>, <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, <a href="Adolfo%20Wildt">Adolfo Wildt</a>, and <a href="Ossip%20Zadkine">Ossip Zadkine</a>. <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a> acknowledged Rodin's seminal influence on his work.

Several films have been made featuring Rodin as a prominent character or presence. These include "<a href="Camille%20Claudel%20%28film%29">Camille Claudel</a>", a 1988 film in which <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Depardieu">Gérard Depardieu</a> portrays Rodin, "<a href="Camille%20Claudel%201915">Camille Claudel 1915</a>" from 2013, and "<a href="Rodin%20%28film%29">Rodin</a>", a 2017 film starring <a href="Vincent%20Lindon">Vincent Lindon</a> as Rodin.

In 2011 the world premiere of <a href="Boris%20Eifman">Boris Eifman</a>'s new ballet "Rodin" took place in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. The ballet is dedicated to the life and work of Auguste Rodin and Camille Claudel.

The relative ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: a survey of expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists. Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have been revealed. A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s and led to the conviction of art dealer <a href="Guy%20Hain">Guy Hain</a>.

To deal with the complexity of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts – the maximum number that can be made from an artist's plasters and still be considered his work. As a result of this limit, "<a href="The%20Burghers%20of%20Calais">The Burghers of Calais</a>", for example, is found in fourteen cities.

In the market for sculpture, plagued by fakes, the value of a piece increases significantly when its provenance can be established. A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8 million in 1999, and Rodin's bronze "Eve, grand modele – version sans rocher" sold for $18.9 million at a 2008 <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> auction in New York. Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued that taking a cast does not equal reproducing a Rodin sculpture – especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin's work.

A number of drawings, previously attributed to Rodin, are now known to have been forged by <a href="Ernest%20Durig">Ernest Durig</a>.

Ann Arbor, Michigan

Ann Arbor is a <a href="city">city</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> and the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="Washtenaw%20County%2C%20Michigan">Washtenaw County</a>. The <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 census</a> recorded its population to be 113,934, making it the <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20in%20Michigan%20%28by%20population%29">sixth largest city in Michigan</a>. 

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of <a href="Quercus%20macrocarpa">Bur Oak</a> trees. The <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate in the early to mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and <a href="Opposition%20to%20U.S.%20involvement%20in%20the%20Vietnam%20War">anti-Vietnam War movement</a>, as well as various student movements.

Ann Arbor is home to the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, one of the foremost research universities in the United States. The university shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Health%20System">medical center</a>. The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development infrastructure, and by its graduates.

In about 1774, the <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a> founded two villages in the area of what is now Ann Arbor.

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators <a href="John%20Allen%20%28pioneer%29">John Allen</a> and <a href="Elisha%20Walker%20Rumsey">Elisha Walker Rumsey</a>. On May 25, 1824, the town <a href="plat">plat</a> was registered with Wayne County as "Annarbour;" this represents the earliest known use of the town's name. Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of <a href="Quercus%20macrocarpa%23Cultural">Bur Oak</a> in the of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre. The local <a href="Ojibwe%20people">Ojibwa</a> named the settlement "kaw-goosh-kaw-nick", after the sound of Allen's <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>.
Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827, and was incorporated as a village in 1833. The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capital, but lost the bid to <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a>. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, which moved from Detroit.

Since the university's establishment in the city in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the <a href="Michigan%20Central%20Railroad">Michigan Central Railroad</a>, and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a> and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the <a href="Long%20Depression">Depression of 1873</a>. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in <a href="Mill%20%28grinding%29">milling</a>. Ann Arbor's <a href="American%20Jews">Jewish</a> community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, <a href="Beth%20Israel%20Congregation%20%28Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan%29">Beth Israel Congregation</a>, was established in 1916.
During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and <a href="Opposition%20to%20U.S.%20involvement%20in%20the%20Vietnam%20War">anti-Vietnam War movement</a>, as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group <a href="Students%20for%20a%20Democratic%20Society%20%281960%20organization%29">Students for a Democratic Society</a> took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. <a href="teach-in">teach-in</a> against the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. During the ensuing 15 years, many <a href="counterculture">countercultural</a> and <a href="New%20Left">New Left</a> enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the <a href="Human%20Rights%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Human Rights Party</a> (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering <a href="civil%20rights">antidiscrimination</a> ordinances, <a href="Cannabis%20laws%20in%20Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">measures decriminalizing marijuana possession</a>, and a <a href="rent%20control">rent-control</a> ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include <a href="Word%20of%20God%20%28community%29">Word of God</a> (established in 1967), a <a href="Charismatic%20Movement">charismatic</a> inter-denominational movement; and the <a href="Thomas%20More%20Law%20Center">Thomas More Law Center</a> (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.

Following a 1956-vote, the city of East Ann Arbor merged with Ann Arbor to encompass the eastern sections of the city.

In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, <a href="gentrification">gentrification</a>, and <a href="urban%20sprawl">urban sprawl</a> stretching into outlying countryside. On November 4, 2003, voters approved a <a href="green%20belt">greenbelt</a> plan under which the city government bought development rights on agricultural parcels of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits. Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the "top places to live" lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year. In 2008, it was ranked by <a href="CNNMoney.com">CNNMoney.com</a> 27th out of 100 "America's best small cities". And in 2010, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" listed Ann Arbor as one of the most liveable cities in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

According to the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water, much of which is part of the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a>. Ann Arbor is about west of Detroit. <a href="Ann%20Arbor%20Charter%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor Charter Township</a> adjoins the city's north and east sides. Ann Arbor is situated on the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a> in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of hills and valleys, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River. The elevation ranges from about along the Huron River to on the city's west side, near the intersection of Maple Road and Pauline Blvd. Generally, the west-central and northwestern parts of the city and U-M's North Campus are the highest parts of the city; the lowest parts are along the Huron River and in the southeast. <a href="Ann%20Arbor%20Municipal%20Airport">Ann Arbor Municipal Airport</a>, which is south of the city at , has an elevation of .

Ann Arbor's "Tree Town" nickname stems from the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city contains more than 50,000 trees along its streets and an equal number in parks. In recent years, the <a href="emerald%20ash%20borer">emerald ash borer</a> has destroyed many of the city's approximately 10,500 <a href="ash%20tree">ash tree</a>s. The city contains 157 municipal parks ranging from small neighborhood green spots to large recreation areas. Several large city parks and a university park border sections of the Huron River. Fuller Recreation Area, near the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Health%20System">University Hospital</a> complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and <a href="bike%20path">bike path</a>s, and swimming pools. The <a href="Nichols%20Arboretum">Nichols Arboretum</a>, owned by the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, is a <a href="arboretum">arboretum</a> that contains hundreds of plant and tree species. It is on the city's east side, near the university's Central Campus. Located across the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a> just beyond the university's North Campus is the university's <a href="Matthaei%20Botanical%20Gardens">Matthaei Botanical Gardens</a>, which contains 300 acres of gardens and a large tropical conservatory.
The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown Ann Arbor. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near I-94 and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, <a href="Briarwood%20Mall">Briarwood Mall</a>, and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. Downtown contains a mix of 19th- and early-20th-century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a <a href="farmers%27%20market">farmers' market</a> in the <a href="Kerrytown">Kerrytown district</a>. The city's commercial districts are composed mostly of two- to four-story structures, although downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.

Ann Arbor's residential neighborhoods contain architectural styles ranging from classic 19th-century and early-20th-century designs to <a href="ranch-style%20house">ranch-style house</a>s. Among these homes are a number of <a href="Kit%20houses%20in%20Michigan">kit houses</a> built in the early 20th century. Contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. <a href="Tower%20Plaza">Tower Plaza</a>, a 26-story condominium building located between the University of Michigan campus and downtown, is the tallest building in Ann Arbor.

Ann Arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>, the large number of <a href="medical%20marijuana">medical marijuana</a> dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from <a href="Michigan%20Stadium">Michigan Stadium</a> until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual <a href="Hash%20Bash">Hash Bash</a>: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April.

Act of Settlement 1701

The Act of Settlement is an <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Parliament%20of%20England">Act of the Parliament of England</a> that was passed in 1701 to settle the <a href="order%20of%20succession">succession</a> to the <a href="List%20of%20English%20monarchs">English</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Irish%20monarchs">Irish</a> crowns on <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>s only. The next Protestant in line to the throne was the <a href="Electress">Electress</a> <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Sophia of Hanover</a>, a granddaughter of <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James VI of Scotland and I of England</a>. After her the crowns would descend only to her non-<a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> heirs.

The act was prompted by the failure of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">King William III</a> and <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Queen Mary II</a>, as well as of Mary's sister <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>, to produce any surviving children, and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> religion of all other members of the <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">House of Stuart</a>. The line of <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Sophia of Hanover</a> was the most junior among the Stuarts, but consisted of convinced Protestants. Sophia died on 8 June 1714, before the death of Queen Anne on 1 August 1714. On Queen Anne's death, Sophia's son duly became <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George I</a> and started the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverian dynasty</a> in Britain.

The act played a key role in the formation of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. England and Scotland had <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Crowns">shared a monarch</a> since 1603, but had remained separately governed countries. The <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20%28pre-1707%29">Scottish parliament</a> was more reluctant than the <a href="English%20Parliament">English</a> to abandon the House of Stuart, members of which had been <a href="Scottish%20monarchs">Scottish monarchs</a> long before they became <a href="English%20monarchs">English ones</a>. English pressure on Scotland to accept the Act of Settlement was one factor leading to the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">parliamentary union of the two countries</a> in 1707.

Under the Act of Settlement anyone who became a Roman Catholic, or who married one, became disqualified to inherit the throne. The act also placed limits on both the role of foreigners in the British government and the power of the monarch with respect to the Parliament of England. Some of those provisions have been altered by subsequent legislation.

Along with the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights 1689</a>, the Act of Settlement remains today one of the main constitutional laws governing the <a href="Succession%20to%20the%20British%20throne">succession</a> not only to the <a href="throne%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">throne of the United Kingdom</a>, but to those of the other <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s, whether by assumption or by <a href="patriation">patriation</a>. The Act of Settlement cannot be altered in any realm except by that realm's own parliament and, by <a href="Convention%20%28norm%29%23Government">convention</a>, only with the consent of all the other realms, as it touches on the succession to the <a href="Commonwealth%20realm%23The%20Crown%20in%20the%20Commonwealth%20realms">shared crown</a>.

The original documents are deposited in the Lower Saxon State Archives in Hanover, Germany.

Following the <a href="Perth%20Agreement">Perth Agreement</a> in 2011, legislation amending the act came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015, and removed the disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic.

Following the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>, the line of succession to the English throne was governed by the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights 1689</a>, which declared that the flight of <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> from England to France during the revolution amounted to an <a href="abdication">abdication</a> of the throne and that James' daughter, <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary, Princesses of Orange</a> and her husband <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William, Prince of Orange</a> (who was also James' nephew), were James' successors, who ruled jointly as <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> and <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary II</a>. The Bill of Rights also provided that the line of succession would go through their descendants, then through Mary's sister <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Princess Anne</a>, and her descendants, and then to the issue of William III by a later marriage (if he were to marry again after the death of Mary II). During the debate, the House of Lords had attempted to append Sophia and her descendants to the line of succession, but the amendment failed in the Commons.

Mary II died childless in 1694, after which William III did not remarry. In 1700, <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Prince William, Duke of Gloucester</a>, who was the only child of Princess Anne to survive infancy, died of a fever at the age of 11. Thus, Anne was left as the last remaining legal heir to the throne. The Bill of Rights excluded Catholics from the throne, which ruled out James II and his descendants. However, it did not provide for the further succession after Anne. Parliament thus saw the need to settle the succession on Sophia and her descendants, and thereby guarantee the continuity of the Crown in the Protestant line.

With religion and lineage initially decided, the ascendancy of William of Orange in 1689 would also bring his partiality to his foreign favourites that followed. By 1701 English jealousy of foreigners was rampant, and action was considered necessary for correction.

The Act of Settlement provided that the throne would pass to the <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Electress Sophia of Hanover</a> – a granddaughter of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James VI and I</a> and a niece of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles I</a> – and her descendants, but it excluded "all and every Person and Persons who ... is are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the <a href="Holy%20See">See</a> or <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Church of Rome</a> or shall profess the Popish Religion or shall marry a Papist". Thus, those who were Roman Catholics, and those who married Roman Catholics, were barred from ascending the throne. Eight additional provisions of the act would only come into effect upon the death of both William and Anne:


For different reasons, various <a href="constitutionalist">constitutionalist</a>s have praised the Act of Settlement: <a href="Henry%20Hallam">Henry Hallam</a> called the Act "the seal of our constitutional laws" and <a href="David%20Lindsay%20Keir">David Lindsay Keir</a> placed its importance above the Bill of Rights of 1689. Naamani Tarkow has written: "If one is to make sweeping statements, one may say that, save <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a> (more truly, its implications), the Act of Settlement is probably the most significant statute in English history".

The Act of Settlement was, in many ways, the major cause of the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">union</a> of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> with <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a> to form the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. The <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> was not happy with the Act of Settlement and, in response, passed the <a href="Act%20of%20Security">Act of Security</a> in 1704, through which Scotland reserved the right to choose its own successor to <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>. Stemming from this, the Parliament of England decided that, to ensure the stability and future prosperity of Great Britain, full union of the two parliaments and nations was essential before Anne's death.

It used a combination of exclusionary legislation (the <a href="Alien%20Act%201705">Alien Act 1705</a>), politics, and <a href="bribery">bribery</a> to achieve this within three years under the <a href="Act%20of%20Union%201707">Act of Union 1707</a>. This success was in marked contrast to the four attempts at political union between 1606 and 1689, which all failed owing to a lack of political will in both kingdoms. By virtue of Article II of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Union">Treaty of Union</a>, which defined the succession to the throne of Great Britain, the Act of Settlement became part of <a href="Scots%20Law">Scots Law</a> as well.

In addition to <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> (who died a few months after the act received royal assent) and his Roman Catholic children, <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">Prince James</a> and the <a href="Louisa%20Maria%20Teresa%20Stuart">Princess Royal</a>, the act also excluded the descendants of King James's sister, <a href="Princess%20Henrietta%20of%20England">Henrietta</a>, the youngest daughter of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. Henrietta's daughter, <a href="Anne%20Marie%20d%27Orl%C3%A9ans">Anne</a>, was then the Queen of Sardinia and a Roman Catholic; <a href="Jacobite%20succession">Jacobite pretenders</a> after 1807 are descended from her.

With the legitimate descendants of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> either childless (in the case of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> and <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Anne</a>) or Roman Catholic, parliament's choice was limited to the Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, the daughter of the late <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth of Bohemia</a>, who was the only other child of <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James I</a> not to have died in childhood. Elizabeth had borne nine children who reached adulthood, of whom <a href="Sophia%20of%20Hanover">Sophia</a> was the youngest daughter. However, in 1701, Sophia was the senior Protestant with a legitimate claim to the English throne; Parliament passed over senior living representatives of lines which included <a href="Elizabeth%20Charlotte%2C%20Princess%20Palatine">Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orléans</a>; <a href="Louis%20Otto%2C%20Prince%20of%20Salm">Louis Otto, Prince of Salm</a>, and his sisters; <a href="Anne%20Henriette%20of%20Bavaria">Anne Henriette, Princess of Condé</a>; <a href="Benedicta%20Henrietta%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Benedicta Henrietta, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>; and Sophia's sister, <a href="Louise%20Hollandine%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Louise Hollandine of the Palatinate</a> because they were all Roman Catholic.

Since the Act's passing the most senior living member of the Royal Family to have married a Roman Catholic, and thereby to have been removed from the line of succession, is <a href="Prince%20Michael%20of%20Kent">Prince Michael of Kent</a>, who married <a href="Princess%20Michael%20of%20Kent">Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz</a> in 1978; he was fifteenth in the line of succession at the time. He was restored to the line of succession in 2015 when the <a href="Succession%20to%20the%20Crown%20Act%202013">Succession to the Crown Act 2013</a> came into force, and became 34th in line.

The next most senior living descendant of the Electress Sophia who had been ineligible to succeed on this ground is <a href="George%20Windsor%2C%20Earl%20of%20St%20Andrews">George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews</a>, the eldest son of <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent</a>, who married the Roman Catholic <a href="Sylvana%20Windsor%2C%20Countess%20of%20St%20Andrews">Sylvana Palma Tomaselli</a> in 1988. His son, <a href="Edward%20Windsor%2C%20Lord%20Downpatrick">Lord Downpatrick</a>, converted to Roman Catholicism in 2003 and is the most senior descendant of Sophia to be barred as a result of his religion. More recently, <a href="Peter%20Phillips">Peter Phillips</a>, the son of <a href="Anne%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Anne, Princess Royal</a>, and eleventh in line to the throne, married <a href="Autumn%20Phillips">Autumn Kelly</a>; Kelly had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but she converted to <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a> prior to the wedding. Had she not done so, Phillips would have forfeited his place in the succession upon their marriage.

Excluding those princesses who have married into Roman Catholic royal families, such as <a href="Marie%20of%20Romania">Marie of Edinburgh</a>, <a href="Victoria%20Eugenie%20of%20Battenberg">Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg</a> and <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh</a>, one member of the Royal Family (that is, with the style of "<a href="Royal%20Highness">Royal Highness</a>") has converted to Roman Catholicism since the passage of the Act: the <a href="Katharine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Kent">Duchess of Kent</a>, wife of <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent</a> who converted on 14 January 1994, but her husband did not lose his place in the succession because she was an Anglican at the time of their marriage.

As well as being part of the law of the United Kingdom, the Act of Settlement was received into the laws of all the countries and territories over which the British monarch reigned. It remains part of the laws of the 16 <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s and the relevant jurisdictions within those realms. In accordance with established convention, the <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201931">Statute of Westminster 1931</a> and later laws, the Act of Settlement (along with the other laws governing the succession of the Commonwealth realms) may only be changed with the agreement of all the realms (and, in some federal realms, the constituent members of those federations).

Challenges have been made against the Act of Settlement, especially its provisions regarding Roman Catholics and <a href="Primogeniture">preference for males</a>. However, legislating for alterations to the Act is a complex process, since the Act is a common denominator in the shared succession of all the <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s. The <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201931">Statute of Westminster 1931</a> acknowledges by established convention that any changes to the rules of succession may be made only with the agreement of all of the states involved, with concurrent amendments to be made by each state's parliament or parliaments. Further, as the current monarch's eldest child and, in turn, his eldest child, are Anglican males, any change to the succession laws would have no immediate implications. Consequently, there was little public concern with the issues and debate had been confined largely to academic circles until, in November 2010, the announcement that <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince William</a> was <a href="Wedding%20of%20Prince%20William%20and%20Catherine%20Middleton">to marry</a>. This raised the question of what would happen if he were to produce first a daughter and then a son.

"<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reported on 6 November 1995 that <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a> had said on that day to <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> and <a href="Paddy%20Ashdown">Paddy Ashdown</a> that "Catholics should be able to ascend to the British throne". Ashdown claimed the Prince said: "I really can't think why we can't have Catholics on the throne". In 1998, during debate on a <a href="Royal%20Succession%20Bills%20and%20Acts">Succession to the Crown Bill</a>, Junior Home Office Minister <a href="Gareth%20Williams%2C%20Baron%20Williams%20of%20Mostyn">Lord Williams of Mostyn</a> informed the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> that the Queen had "no objection to the Government's view that in determining the line of succession to the throne, daughters and sons should be treated in the same way".

In October 2011 the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Australian federal government</a> was reported to have reached an agreement with all of <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">the states</a> on potential changes to their laws in the wake of amendments to the Act of Settlement. The practice of the Australian states—for example, New South Wales and Victoria—has been, when legislating to repeal some imperial statutes so far as they still applied in Australia, to provide that imperial statutes concerning the royal succession remain in force.

The legal process required at the federal level remains, theoretically, unclear. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Australian constitution</a>, as was noted during the crisis of 1936, contains no power for the federal parliament to legislate with respect to the monarchy. Everything thus turns upon the status and meaning of clause 2 in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, which provides: "The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom."

Anne Twomey reviews three possible interpretations of the clause.
However, Twomey expresses confidence that, if the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a> were to be faced with the problems of covering clause 2, it would find some way to conclude that, with regard to Australia, the clause is subject solely to Australian law. Canadian scholar Richard Toporoski theorised in 1998 that "if, let us say, an alteration were to be made in the United Kingdom to the Act of Settlement 1701, providing for the succession of the Crown... [i]t is my opinion that the domestic constitutional law of Australia or Papua New Guinea, for example, would provide for the succession in those countries of the same person who became Sovereign of the United Kingdom."

In practice, when legislating for the Perth Agreement (see below), the Australian governments took the approach of the states requesting, and referring power to, the federal government to enact the legislation on behalf of the states (under paragraph 51(xxxviii) of the Australian Constitution) and the Commonwealth of Australia.

In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, where the Act of Settlement () is now a part of <a href="Constitution%20of%20Canada">Canadian constitutional law</a>, <a href="Tony%20O%27Donohue">Tony O'Donohue</a>, a Canadian civic politician, took issue with the provisions that exclude <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>s from the throne, and which make the <a href="monarchy%20of%20Canada">monarch of Canada</a> the <a href="Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">Supreme Governor of the Church of England</a>, requiring him or her to be an <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a>. This, he claimed, discriminated against non-Anglicans, including Catholics, who are the largest faith group in Canada. In 2002, O'Donohue launched <a href="O%27Donohue%20v.%20Canada">a court action</a> that argued the Act of Settlement violated the <a href="Canadian%20Charter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>, but, the case was dismissed by the court. It found that, as the Act of Settlement is part of the Canadian constitution, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as another part of the same constitution, does not have supremacy over it. Also, the court noted that, while Canada has the power to amend the line of succession to the Canadian throne, the Statute of Westminster stipulates that the agreement of the governments of the fifteen other Commonwealth realms that share the Crown would first have to be sought if Canada wished to continue its relationship with these countries. An appeal of the decision was dismissed on 16 March 2005. Some commentators state that, as a result of this, any single provincial legislature could hinder any attempts to change this Act, and by extension, to the line of succession for the shared crown of all 16 Commonwealth realms. Others contend that that is not the case, and changes to the succession instituted by an Act of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">Parliament of Canada</a> "[in accord] with the convention of symmetry that preserves the personal unity of the British and Dominion Crowns".

With the announcement in 2007 of the <a href="engagement">engagement</a> of <a href="Peter%20Phillips">Peter Phillips</a> to <a href="Autumn%20Phillips">Autumn Kelly</a>, a Roman Catholic and a Canadian, discussion about the Act of Settlement was revived. <a href="Norman%20Spector">Norman Spector</a> called in "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" for <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</a> to address the issue of the act's bar on Catholics, saying Phillips' marriage to Kelly would be the first time the provisions of the act would bear directly on Canada—Phillips would be barred from acceding to the Canadian throne because he married a Roman Catholic Canadian. (In fact, <a href="George%20Windsor%2C%20Earl%20of%20St%20Andrews">the Earl of St Andrews</a> had already lost his place in the line of succession when he married the Roman Catholic Canadian <a href="Sylvana%20Windsor%2C%20Countess%20of%20St%20Andrews">Sylvana Palma Tomaselli</a> in 1988. But St Andrews' place in the line of succession was significantly lower than Phillips'.) Criticism of the Act of Settlement due to the Phillips–Kelly marriage was muted when Autumn Kelly converted to Anglicanism shortly before her marriage, thus preserving her husband's place in the line of succession.

From time to time there has been debate over repealing the clause that prevents Roman Catholics, or those who marry one, from ascending to the British throne. Proponents of repeal argue that the clause is a bigoted <a href="anachronism">anachronism</a>; <a href="Thomas%20Winning">Cardinal Winning</a>, who was leader of the Roman Catholic Church in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, called the act an "insult" to Catholics. <a href="Cormac%20Murphy-O%27Connor">Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor</a>, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England, pointed out that Prince William (later the Duke of Cambridge) "can marry by law a <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>, a <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>, anyone, but not a Roman Catholic". Opponents of repeal, such as <a href="Enoch%20Powell">Enoch Powell</a> and <a href="Adrian%20Hilton">Adrian Hilton</a>, believe that it would lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state religion if a Roman Catholic were to come to the throne. They also note that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and be a member of the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, but that a Roman Catholic monarch would, like all Roman Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope. This would, according to opponents of repeal, amount to a loss of <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> for the Anglican Church.

When in December 1978 there was media speculation that <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a> might marry a Roman Catholic, Powell defended the provision that excludes Roman Catholics from ascending the throne, claiming his objection was not rooted in religious bigotry but in political considerations. He stated a Roman Catholic monarch would mean the acceptance of a source of authority external to the realm and "in the literal sense, foreign to the <a href="Queen-in-Parliament">Crown-in-Parliament</a> ... Between Roman Catholicism and <a href="royal%20supremacy">royal supremacy</a> there is, as St <a href="Thomas%20More">Thomas More</a> concluded, no reconciliation". Powell concluded that a Roman Catholic crown would be the destruction of the Church of England because "it would contradict the essential character of that church".

He continued:
When <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> wrote that "the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> sitting crowned upon the grave thereof", he was promulgating an enormously important truth. Authority in the Roman Church is the exertion of that "imperium" from which England in the 16th century finally and decisively declared its national independence as the "alter imperium", the "other empire", of which <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> declared "This realm of England is an empire" ... It would signal the beginning of the end of the British monarchy. It would portend the eventual surrender of everything that has made us, and keeps us still, a nation.

The <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> unanimously passed a motion in 1999 calling for the complete removal of any discrimination linked to the monarchy and the repeal of the Act of Settlement. The following year, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" challenged the succession law in court, claiming that it violated the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, which provides,
The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.

As the Convention nowhere lists the right to succeed to the Crown as a human right, the challenge was rejected.

<a href="Adrian%20Hilton">Adrian Hilton</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" in 2003, defended the Act of Settlement as not "irrational prejudice or blind bigotry", but claimed that it was passed because "the nation had learnt that when a Roman Catholic monarch is upon the throne, religious and civil liberty is lost". He points to the Pope's claiming universal jurisdiction, and Hilton argues that "it would be intolerable to have, as the sovereign of a Protestant and free country, one who owes any allegiance to the head of any other state" and contends that, if such situation came about, "we will have undone centuries of common law". He said that because the Roman Catholic Church <a href="apostolicae%20curae">does not recognise</a> the Church of England as an apostolic church, a Roman Catholic monarch who abided by their faith's doctrine would be obliged to view Anglican and <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> archbishops, bishops, and clergy as part of the <a href="laity">laity</a> and therefore "lacking the ordained authority to preach and celebrate the sacraments". (Hilton noted that the Church of Scotland's <a href="Presbyterian%20polity">Presbyterian polity</a> does not include bishops or archbishops.) Hilton said a Roman Catholic monarch would be unable to be crowned by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and notes that other European states have similar religious provisions for their monarchs: <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, whose constitutions compel their monarchs to be <a href="Lutheranism">Lutherans</a>; the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, which has a constitution requiring its monarchs be members of the Protestant <a href="House%20of%20Orange">House of Orange</a>; and <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, which has a constitution that provides for the succession to be through Roman Catholic houses.

In December 2004, a private member's bill—the <a href="Succession%20to%20the%20Crown%20Bill%202004">Succession to the Crown Bill</a>—was introduced in the House of Lords. The government, headed by <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>, blocked all attempts to revise the succession laws, claiming it would raise too many constitutional issues and it was unnecessary at the time. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202005">British general election</a> the following year, <a href="Michael%20Howard">Michael Howard</a> promised to work towards having the prohibition removed if the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> gained a majority of seats in the House of Commons, but the election was won by Blair's <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>. Four years later, plans drawn up by <a href="Chris%20Bryant">Chris Bryant</a> were revealed that would end the exclusion of Catholics from the throne and end the doctrine of agnatic (male-preference) <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a> in favour of absolute primogeniture, which governs succession solely on birth order and not on sex. The issue was raised again in January 2009, when a private members bill to amend the Act of Succession was introduced in parliament.

In early 2011 <a href="Keith%20Vaz">Keith Vaz</a>, a <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> Member of Parliament, introduced to the House of Commons at Westminster a <a href="private%20member%27s%20bill">private member's bill</a> which proposed that the Act of Settlement be amended to remove the provisions relating to Roman Catholicism and change the primogeniture governing the line of succession to the British throne from <a href="agnatic%20primogeniture">agnatic</a> to <a href="Absolute%20cognatic%20primogeniture">absolute cognatic</a>. Vaz sought support for his project from the Canadian Cabinet and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</a>, but the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Prime%20Minister%20%28Canada%29">Office of the Prime Minister of Canada</a> responded that the issue was "not a priority for the government or for Canadians without further elaboration on the merits or drawbacks of the proposed reforms". <a href="Stephenson%20King">Stephenson King</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Saint%20Lucia">Prime Minister of Saint Lucia</a>, said he supported the idea and it was reported that the government of New Zealand did, as well. The <a href="Monarchist%20League%20of%20Canada">Monarchist League of Canada</a> said at the time to the media that it "supports amending the Act of Settlement in order to modernize the succession rules".

Later the same year, the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, <a href="Nick%20Clegg">Nick Clegg</a>, announced that the government was considering a change in the law. At approximately the same time, it was reported that British Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> had written to each of the prime ministers of the other fifteen Commonwealth realms, asking for their support in changing the succession to absolute primogeniture and notifying them he would raise his proposals at <a href="Commonwealth%20Heads%20of%20Government%20Meeting%202011">that year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting</a> (CHOGM) in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, Australia. Cameron reportedly also proposed removing the restriction on successors being or marrying Roman Catholics; however, potential Roman Catholic successors would be required to convert to Anglicanism prior to acceding to the throne. In reaction to the letter and media coverage, Harper stated that, this time, he was "supportive" of what he saw as "reasonable modernizations".

At CHOGM on 28 October 2011, the prime ministers of the other Commonwealth realms agreed to support Cameron's proposed changes to the Act. The bill put before the Parliament of the United Kingdom would act as a model for the legislation required to be passed in at least some of the other realms, and any changes would only first take effect if the <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Duke</a> and <a href="Catherine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cambridge">Duchess of Cambridge</a> were to have a daughter before a son.

The British group <a href="Republic%20%28political%20organisation%29">Republic</a> asserted that succession reform would not make the monarchy any less discriminatory. As it welcomed the gender equality reforms, the British newspaper "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" criticized the lack of a proposal to remove the ban on Catholics sitting on the throne, as did <a href="Alex%20Salmond">Alex Salmond</a>, First Minister of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, who pointed out that "It is deeply disappointing that the reform [of the Act of Settlement of 1701] has stopped short of removing the unjustifiable barrier on a Catholic becoming monarch". On the subject, Cameron asserted: "Let me be clear, the monarch must be in communion with the Church of England because he or she is the <a href="Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">head of that Church</a>."

The disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic was removed by the <a href="Succession%20to%20the%20Crown%20Act%202013">Succession to the Crown Act 2013</a>.

Aircraft hijacking

Aircraft hijacking (also air piracy or aircraft piracy, especially within the special aircraft <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, and informally as skyjacking) is the <a href="Crime">unlawful</a> seizure of an <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> by an individual or a group. In most cases, the <a href="Pilot%20%28aeronautics%29">pilot</a> is forced to fly according to the orders of the hijackers. Occasionally, however, the hijackers have flown the aircraft themselves, such as the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. In at least three cases, the plane was hijacked by the official pilot or co-pilot.

Unlike the typical hijackings of land vehicles or ships, skyjacking is not usually committed for robbery or theft. Most aircraft hijackers intend to use the passengers as <a href="hostage">hostage</a>s, either for <a href="Ransom">monetary ransom</a> or for some political or administrative concession by authorities. Various motives have driven such occurrences, including demanding the release of certain <a href="Incarceration">inmate</a>s (notably <a href="Indian%20Airlines%20Flight%20814">IC-814</a>), highlighting the grievances of a particular community (notably <a href="Air%20France%20Flight%208969">AF 8969</a>), or <a href="political%20asylum">political asylum</a> (notably <a href="Ethiopian%20Airlines%20Flight%20961">ET 961</a>). Hijackers also have used aircraft as a weapon to target particular locations (notably during the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>).

Hijackings for hostages commonly produce an armed standoff during a period of negotiation between hijackers and authorities, followed by some form of settlement. Settlements do not always meet the hijackers' original demands. If the hijackers' demands are deemed too great and the perpetrators show no inclination to surrender, authorities sometimes employ armed <a href="Counter-terrorism">special forces</a> to attempt a rescue of the hostages (notably <a href="Lufthansa%20Flight%20181">Lufthansa Flight 181</a>).



The so-called "Golden Age" of skyjacking in the United States ran from 1968 through 1979, and into the 1980s in parts of the world, with attacks tapering off after as new regulations made boarding aircraft with weapons extremely difficult.

On September 11, 2001, 19 <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> <a href="Islamic%20extremist">Islamic extremist</a>s hijacked <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%2011">American Airlines Flight 11</a>, <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%20175">United Airlines Flight 175</a>, <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%2077">American Airlines Flight 77</a>, and <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%2093">United Airlines Flight 93</a> and crashed them into the Twin Towers of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a>, the southwestern side of <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>, and <a href="Stonycreek%20Township%2C%20Somerset%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Stonycreek Township</a> near <a href="Shanksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shanksville, Pennsylvania</a> (after passengers acted to stop the hijackers; its intended target was either the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> or the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">U.S. Capitol</a>) in a <a href="terrorist%20attack">terrorist attack</a>. All in all, <a href="Casualties%20of%20the%20September%2011%20attacks">2,996 people perished and more than 6,000 others were injured in the attacks</a>. This casualty toll makes the hijackings the most fatal in history.

A <a href="Pakistan%20Air%20Force">Pakistan Air Force</a> <a href="T-33%20Shooting%20Star">T-33</a> trainer was hijacked on August 20, 1971, before the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20war%20of%201971">Indo-Pakistani war of 1971</a> in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> when a <a href="Bengali%20people">Bengali</a> instructor pilot, <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> <a href="Matiur%20Rahman%20%28military%20pilot%29">Matiur Rahman</a>, knocked out the young <a href="Pilot%20Officer">Pilot Officer</a> <a href="Rashid%20Minhas">Rashid Minhas</a> with the intention of defecting to <a href="India">India</a> with the plane and national secrets. On regaining consciousness in mid-flight, Minhas struggled for flight control as well as relaying the news of his hijack to the <a href="Pakistan%20Air%20Force">PAF</a> base. In the end of the ensuing struggle he succeeded in crashing his aircraft into the ground near <a href="Thatta">Thatta</a> on seeing no way to prevent the hijack and the defection. He was posthumously awarded Pakistan's highest military award, <a href="Nishan-e-Haider">Nishan-e-Haider</a> ("Sign of the Lion"), for his act of bravery. Matiur Rahman was awarded Bangladesh's highest military award, <a href="Bir%20Sreshtho">Bir Sreshtho</a>, for his attempt to defect to join the civil war in East Pakistan (modern-day Bangladesh).


Most hijackings will involve the plane landing at a certain destination, followed by the hijackers making negotiable demands. <a href="Aviator">Pilot</a>s and <a href="flight%20attendant">flight attendant</a>s are still trained to adopt the "Common Strategy" tactic, which was approved by the United States <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">FAA</a>. It teaches crew members to comply with the hijackers' demands, get the plane to land safely and then let the security forces handle the situation. Crew members should advise passengers to sit quietly in order to increase their chances of survival. They were also trained not to make any heroic moves that could endanger themselves or other people. The FAA realized that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it would end peacefully with the hijackers reaching their goal; often, during the epidemic of skyjackings in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the end result was an inconvenient but otherwise harmless trip to Cuba for the passengers.

Later examples of active passenger and crew member resistance occurred when passengers and flight attendants of <a href="2001%20failed%20shoe%20bomb%20attempt">American Airlines Flight 63</a> from <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami</a> on December 22, 2001, teamed up to help prevent <a href="Richard%20Reid%20%28shoe%20bomber%29">Richard Reid</a> from igniting explosives hidden in his shoes. Another example is when a few passengers and flight attendants teamed up to subdue <a href="Umar%20Farouk%20Abdulmutallab">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> who attempted to detonate explosives sewn into his underwear aboard <a href="Northwest%20Flight%20253">Northwest Flight 253</a> on December 25, 2009. Flight attendants and pilots now receive extensive anti-hijacking and self-defense training designed to thwart a hijacking or bombing.

In 2012, six hijackers hijacked <a href="Tianjin%20Airlines%20Flight%207554">Tianjin Airlines flight 7554</a>. Two of the hijackers died from severe injuries sustained during a fight with passengers and crew who attempted to subdue them. A doctor led elderly and children away from the violence. The hijackers had weapons which they used to attack cabin crew and passengers.

Six policemen were on board the aircraft. They helped remove explosives and weapons from the hijackers. A group of resourceful passengers protected the cockpit door using a beverage cart that was rolled in front of the door. The pilot heard screaming and fighting from the cabin. A first class flight attendant was injured trying to stop three hijackers who were in first class from entering the cockpit. Seven passengers were injured during the fights on board the aircraft. It was the first violent hijacking since the 9/11 attacks in North America. When the pilot realized what was happening, he decided to fly the aircraft back to the airport. Once the plane landed, police surrounded it.

To alert air traffic control that an aircraft is being hijacked, a pilot under duress should <a href="Transponder%20%28aviation%29%23Transponder%20codes">squawk</a> 7500 or vocally, by radio communication, transmit "(Aircraft callsign); Transponder seven five zero zero." This should be done when possible and safe. An air traffic controller who suspects an aircraft may have been hijacked may ask the pilot to confirm "squawking assigned code." If the aircraft is "not" being hijacked, the pilot should "not" squawk 7500 and should inform the controller accordingly. A pilot under <a href="duress">duress</a> may also elect to respond that the aircraft is not being hijacked, but then neglect to change to a different squawk code. In this case, the controller would make no further requests and immediately inform the appropriate authorities. A complete lack of a response would also be taken to indicate a possible hijacking. Of course, a loss of radio communications may also be the cause for a lack of response, in which case a pilot would usually squawk 7600 anyway.

On 9/11, the suicide hijackers did not make any attempt to contact ground control to inform anyone about their hijackings, nor engage in any dialogue or negotiations. However, the hijacker-pilot of Flight 11 and the ringleader of the terrorist cell, <a href="Mohamed%20Atta">Mohamed Atta</a>, mistakenly transmitted announcements to <a href="Air%20traffic%20control">ATC</a>, meaning to go through the Boeing 767. Also, onboard flight attendants <a href="Madeline%20Amy%20Sweeney">Amy Sweeney</a> and <a href="Betty%20Ong">Betty Ong</a> called the <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> office, telling the workers that Flight 11 was hijacked. 9/11 hijacker-pilot <a href="Ziad%20Jarrah">Ziad Jarrah</a> aboard Flight 93 also made a similar error when he mistakenly transmitted two announcements to ATC about the hijacking.

Cockpit doors on most commercial aircraft have been strengthened and are now bullet resistant. In the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, the Netherlands and France, <a href="Air%20Marshal%20%28civil%20aviation%29">air marshal</a>s have also been added to some flights to deter and thwart hijackers. <a href="Airport%20security">Airport security</a> plays a major role in preventing hijackers. Screening passengers with <a href="metal%20detector">metal detector</a>s and luggage with <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> machines helps prevent weapons from being taken on an aircraft. Along with the <a href="FAA">FAA</a>, the <a href="FBI">FBI</a> also monitors terror suspects. Any person who is seen as a threat to civil aviation is banned from flying.

According to reports, U.S. fighter pilots have been trained to shoot down hijacked commercial airliners if necessary. Other countries, such as India, Poland, and Russia have enacted similar laws or decrees that allow the downing of hijacked planes. However, in September 2008 the Polish Constitutional Court ruled that the Polish rules were unconstitutional, and voided them.

India published its new anti-hijacking policy in August 2005. The policy came into force after the <a href="Cabinet%20Committee%20on%20Security">Cabinet Committee on Security</a> (CCS) approved it. The main points of the policy are:

The list of strategic targets is prepared by the Bureau of Civil Aviation in India. The decision to shoot down a plane is taken by CCS. However, due to the shortage of time, whoever – the prime minister, the defense minister or the home minister – can be reached first will take the call. In situations in which an aircraft becomes a threat while taking off – which gives very little reaction time – a decision on shooting it down may be taken by an Indian Air Force officer not below the rank of Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Operations).

In January 2005, a federal law came into force in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> – the "<a href="Luftsicherheitsgesetz">Luftsicherheitsgesetz</a>" – that allowed "direct action by armed force" against a hijacked aircraft to prevent a 9/11-type attack. However, in February 2006 the <a href="Federal%20Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Germany">Federal Constitutional Court of Germany</a> struck down these provisions of the law, stating such preventive measures were unconstitutional and would essentially be state-sponsored murder, even if such an act would save many more lives on the ground. The main reasoning behind this decision was that the state would effectively be taking the lives of innocent hostages in order to avoid a terrorist attack. The Court also ruled that the <a href="Minister%20of%20Defense">Minister of Defense</a> is constitutionally not entitled to act in terrorism matters, as this is the duty of the state and federal police forces. "See the , or."

The then <a href="President%20of%20Germany">President of Germany</a>, <a href="Horst%20K%C3%B6hler">Horst Köhler</a>, himself urged judicial review of the constitutionality of the Luftsicherheitsgesetz after he signed it into law in 2005.

The <a href="Tokyo%20Convention">Tokyo Convention</a> states in Article 11, defining the so-called unlawful takeover of an aircraft, that the parties signing the agreement are obliged, in case of hijacking or a threat of it, to take all the necessary measures in order to regain or keep control over an aircraft. The detailed analysis of the quoted article shows that in order of an unlawful takeover of an aircraft to take place, and at the same time to start the application of the convention, three conditions should be met:

However, even without the order of the captain, any crewmember or passenger can take reasonable measures, when he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that such action is necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft, or of people or property therein. The captain may decide to disembark a suspected person on the territory of any country, where the aircraft would land, and that country must agree to that (Articles 8 and 12 of the Convention).

Continuation of the passengers' journey was a provision that first appeared in the Tokyo Convention (Article 11).

The <a href="Hague%20Hijacking%20Convention">Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft</a> (known as The Hague Convention) went into effect on 14 October 1971. Article 1 of the Convention defines the offences to which it applies.

The Acropolis of Athens (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>: Ἀκρόπολις, "Akrópolis"; , "Akrópoli Athenón" ) is an ancient citadel located on an extremely rocky outcrop above the city of <a href="Athens">Athens</a> and contains the remains of several <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20architecture">ancient buildings</a> of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. The word <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a> comes from the Greek words ("akron", "highest point, extremity") and ("polis", "city"). Although there are many other acropoleis in <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as "The Acropolis" without qualification.

While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> (c. 495 – 429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the site's most important buildings including the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, the <a href="Propylaia">Propylaia</a>, the <a href="Erechtheion">Erechtheion</a> and the <a href="Temple%20of%20Athena%20Nike">Temple of Athena Nike</a>. The Parthenon and the other buildings were seriously damaged during the 1687 siege by the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetians</a> in the <a href="Morean%20War">Morean War</a> when gunpowder being stored in the Parthenon was hit by a cannonball and exploded.

The Acropolis is located on a flat-topped rock that rises above sea level in the city of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, with a surface area of about . It was also known as Cecropia, after the legendary <a href="snake">serpent</a>-man, <a href="Cecrops%20I">Cecrops</a>, the first Athenian king. 
While the earliest artifacts date to the Middle <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> era, there have been documented habitations in <a href="Attica">Attica</a> from the Early Neolithic (6th millennium BC). There is little doubt that a <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> <a href="megaron">megaron</a> stood upon the hill during the late <a href="Aegean%20civilization">Bronze Age</a>. Nothing of this <a href="megaron">megaron</a> survives except, probably, a single limestone column-base and pieces of several sandstone steps. Soon after the palace was constructed, a <a href="Cyclopean">Cyclopean</a> massive circuit wall was built, 760 meters long, up to 10 meters high, and ranging from 3.5 to 6 meters thick. This wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the 5th century. The wall consisted of two <a href="parapet">parapet</a>s built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called "emplekton" (Greek: ἔμπλεκτον). The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers' right-hand side, thus facilitating defense. There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock. <a href="Homer">Homer</a> is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the "strong-built House of <a href="Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a>" ("<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" 7.81). At some point before the 13th century BC, an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the Acropolis. This fissure extended some 35 meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug. An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well served as an invaluable, protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the Mycenaean period. There is no conclusive evidence for the existence of a Mycenean palace on top of the Athenian Acropolis. However, if there was such a palace, it seems to have been supplanted by later building activity.

Not a lot is known about the architectural appearance of the Acropolis until the <a href="Archaic%20Greece">Archaic era</a>. In the 7th and the 6th centuries BC, the site was taken over by <a href="Cylon%20%28ancient%20Athenian%29">Kylon</a> during the failed Kylonian revolt, and twice by <a href="Peisistratos">Peisistratos</a>: all attempts directed at seizing political power by "<a href="coup">coups d'état</a>". Peisistratos built an entry gate or <a href="Propylaea">Propylaea</a> and perhaps embarked on the construction of an earlier temple on the site of the Parthenon where fragments of sculptured limestone have been found as well as the foundations of a large unfinished temple. Nevertheless, it seems that a nine-gate wall, the "<a href="Enneapylon">Enneapylon</a>", had been built around the biggest water spring, the "<a href="Water%20clock">Clepsydra</a>", at the northwestern foot.

A temple to "<a href="Athena">Athena Polias</a>", the <a href="tutelary%20deity">tutelary deity</a> of the city, was erected around 570–550 BC. This <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> limestone building, from which many relics survive, is referred to as the "<a href="Hekatompedon%20temple">Hekatompedon</a>" (Greek for "hundred–footed"), "Ur-Parthenon" (German for "original Parthenon" or "primitive Parthenon"), "H–Architecture" or "Bluebeard" temple, after the pedimental three-bodied man-serpent sculpture, whose beards were painted dark blue. Whether this temple replaced an older one, or just a sacred precinct or altar, is not known. Probably, the "Hekatompedon" was built where the Parthenon now stands.

Between 529–520 BC yet another temple was built by the <a href="Peisistratid">Peisistratid</a>s, the <a href="Old%20Temple%20of%20Athena">Old Temple of Athena</a>, usually referred to as the "Arkhaios Neōs" (ἀρχαῖος νεώς, "ancient temple"). This temple of Athena Polias was built upon the "Doerpfeld" foundations, between the <a href="Erechtheion">Erechtheion</a> and the still-standing Parthenon. "Arkhaios Neōs" was destroyed by the Persian invasion in 480 BC, however, the temple probably was reconstructed since in 454 BC the treasury of the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a> was transferred in its <a href="opisthodomos">opisthodomos</a>. The temple may have been burnt down in 406/405 BC as <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> mentions that the old temple of Athena was set on fire. <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> does not mention it in his 2nd century AD "Description of Greece".

Around 500 BC the "Ur-Parthenon" was dismantled to make place for a newer and grander building, the "<a href="Older%20Parthenon">Older Parthenon</a>" (often called "Pre-Parthenon", "early Parthenon"). Athenians decided to stop the construction of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Olympian%20Zeus%2C%20Athens">Olympieion</a> which was related with the tyrant Peisistratos and his sons and instead used the <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> limestone destined for the Olympieion to build the Older Parthenon. To accommodate it, the south part of the summit was cleared, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of limestone, a foundation deep at some points, and the rest filled with earth kept in place by the retaining wall. However, after the victorious <a href="Battle%20of%20Marathon">Battle of Marathon</a> in 490 BC, the plan was revised and marble was used instead. The limestone phase of the building is referred to as "Pre-Parthenon I", the marble phase as "Pre-Parthenon II". In 485 BC, construction stalled to save resources as <a href="Xerxes%20I%20of%20Persia">Xerxes</a> took the throne.
The Older Parthenon was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC. The building was burned and looted, along with the "Ancient Temple" and practically everything else on the rock. After the Persian crisis had subsided, the Athenians incorporated many of the unfinished temple's architectural members (unfluted column drums, triglyphs, metopes, etc.) into the newly built northern <a href="curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain wall</a> of the Acropolis, where they serve as a prominent "war memorial" and can still be seen today. The devastated site was cleared of debris. Statuary, cult objects, religious offerings and unsalvageable architectural members were buried ceremoniously in several deeply dug pits on the hill, serving conveniently as a fill for the artificial plateau created around the classic Parthenon. This <a href="Perserschutt">"Persian debris"</a> is the richest archaeological deposit excavated on the Acropolis and is well known throughout Greece.

After winning at <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eurymedon">Eurymedon</a> in 468 BC, <a href="Cimon">Cimon</a> and <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a> ordered the reconstruction of the southern and northern walls of the Acropolis. Most of the major temples, including the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, were rebuilt under the leadership of <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> during the <a href="Age%20of%20Pericles">Golden Age of Athens</a> (460–430 BC). <a href="Phidias">Phidias</a>, an Athenian sculptor, and <a href="Ictinus">Ictinus</a> and <a href="Callicrates">Callicrates</a>, two famous architects, were responsible for the reconstruction.

In 437 BC, <a href="Mnesicles">Mnesicles</a> started building the <a href="Propylaea">Propylaea</a>, a monumental gate at the western end of the Acropolis with <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> columns of <a href="Pentelic">Pentelic</a> <a href="marble">marble</a>, partly built upon the old propylaea of Peisistratos. These colonnades were almost finished in 432 BC and had two wings, the northern one decorated with paintings by <a href="Polygnotus">Polygnotus</a>. Around the same time, south of the Propylaea, building started on the small Ionic <a href="Temple%20of%20Athena%20Nike">Temple of Athena Nike</a> in Pentelic marble with <a href="tetrastyle">tetrastyle</a> porches, preserving the essentials of Greek temple design. After an interruption caused by the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>, the temple was finished in the time of <a href="Nicias">Nicias</a>' peace, between 421 BC and 409 BC.
Construction of the elegant temple of <a href="Erechtheion">Erechtheion</a> in Pentelic marble (421–406 BC) was in accordance with a complex plan which took account of the extremely uneven ground and the need to circumvent several shrines in the area. The entrance, facing east, is lined with six Ionic columns. Unusually, the temple has two porches, one on the northwest corner borne by Ionic columns, the other, to the southwest, supported by huge female figures or <a href="Caryatid">Caryatid</a>s. The eastern part of the temple was dedicated to <a href="Athena%20Polias">Athena Polias</a>, while the western part, serving the cult of the archaic king <a href="Erechtheus">Poseidon-Erechtheus</a>, housed the altars of <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> and Voutos, brother of Erechtheus. Little is known about the original plan of the interior which was destroyed by fire in the first century BC and has been rebuilt several times.
During the same period, a combination of sacred precincts including the temples of "Athena Polias", <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>, <a href="Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a>, <a href="Cecrops%20I">Cecrops</a>, <a href="Herse">Herse</a>, <a href="Pandrosos">Pandrosos</a> and <a href="Aglauros">Aglauros</a>, with its "Kore Porch" (Porch of the Maidens) or "<a href="Caryatid">Caryatid</a>s' balcony" was begun. Between the temple of Athena Nike and the Parthenon, there was the <a href="Brauroneion">Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia</a> (or the Brauroneion), the goddess represented as a bear and worshipped in the <a href="deme">deme</a> of Brauron. According to Pausanias, a wooden statue or "<a href="xoanon">xoanon</a>" of the goddess and a statue of <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> made by <a href="Praxiteles">Praxiteles</a> in the 4th century BC were both in the sanctuary.

Behind the Propylaea, Phidias' gigantic bronze statue of <a href="Athena%20Promachos">Athena Promachos</a> ("Athena who fights in the front line"), built between 450 BC and 448 BC, dominated. The base was high, while the total height of the statue was . The goddess held a lance whose gilt tip could be seen as a reflection by crews on ships rounding Cape <a href="Sounion">Sounion</a>, and a giant shield on the left side, decorated by <a href="Mys">Mys</a> with images of the fight between the <a href="Centaur">Centaur</a>s and the <a href="Lapiths">Lapiths</a>. Other monuments that have left almost nothing visible to the present day are the <a href="Chalkotheke">Chalkotheke</a>, the <a href="Pandroseion">Pandroseion</a>, <a href="Pandion%27s%20sanctuary">Pandion's sanctuary</a>, Athena's altar, Zeus Polieus's sanctuary and, from Roman times, the circular temple of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> and <a href="Roma%20%28mythology%29">Rome</a>.

During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, many of the existing buildings in the area of the Acropolis were repaired., due to damage from age, and occasionally, war. Monuments to foreign kings were erected, notably those of the <a href="Attalid">Attalid kings</a> of Pergamon Attalos II (in front of the NW corner of the Parthenon), and Eumenes II, in front of the Propylaia. These were rededicated during the early Roman Empire to Augustus or Claudius (uncertain), and <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Agrippa</a>, respectively. Eumenes was also responsible for constructing a <a href="Stoa%20of%20Eumenes">stoa</a> on the South slope, not unlike that of <a href="Stoa%20of%20Attalos">Attalos</a> in the <a href="Athenian%20agora">Agora</a> below.

During the <a href="Julio-Claudian%20dynasty">Julio-Claudian period</a>, the Temple of Rome and Augustus, a small, round edifice, about 23 meters from the Parthenon, was to be the last significant ancient construction on the summit of the rock. Around the same time, on the North slope, in a cave next to the one dedicated to <a href="Pan%20%28god%29">Pan</a> since the classical period, a sanctuary was founded where the <a href="Archons%23Ancient%20Greece">archons</a> dedicated to <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> on taking office. In 161 AD, on the South slope, the Roman <a href="Herodes%20Atticus">Herodes Atticus</a> built his grand amphitheatre or <a href="Odeon%20of%20Herodes%20Atticus">Odeon</a>. It was destroyed by the invading <a href="Herulian">Herulian</a>s a century later but was reconstructed in the 1950s.

During the 3rd century, under threat from a Herulian invasion, repairs were made to the Acropolis walls, and the "<a href="Beul%C3%A9">Beulé</a> Gate" was constructed to restrict entrance in front of the Propylaia, thus returning the Acropolis to use as a fortress.

In the <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> period, the Parthenon was turned into a church, dedicated to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>. Under the Latin <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Duchy of Athens</a>, the Acropolis functioned as the city's administrative center, with the Parthenon as its cathedral, and the <a href="Propylaia">Propylaia</a> as part of the Ducal <a href="Palace">Palace</a>. A large tower was added, the "<a href="Frankish%20Tower%20%28Acropolis%20of%20Athens%29">Frankopyrgos</a>", demolished in the 19th century.

After the <a href="Ottoman%20Greece">Ottoman conquest of Greece</a>, the Parthenon was used as the garrison headquarters of the Turkish army, and the <a href="Erechtheum">Erechtheum</a> was turned into the <a href="Governor">Governor</a>'s private <a href="Harem">Harem</a>. The buildings of the Acropolis suffered significant damage during the 1687 siege by the Venetians in the <a href="Morean%20War">Morean War</a>. The Parthenon, which was being used as a gunpowder <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>, was hit by <a href="artillery">artillery</a> fire and severely damaged.
In subsequent years, the Acropolis was a site of bustling human activity with many Byzantine, Frankish, and Ottoman structures. The dominant feature during the Ottoman period was a mosque inside the Parthenon, complete with a minaret. Following the <a href="Greek%20War%20of%20Independence">Greek War of Independence</a>, most features that dated from the Byzantine, Frankish and Ottoman periods were cleared from the site in an attempt to restore the monument to its original form, "cleansed" of all later additions.

The entrance to the Acropolis was a monumental gateway called the <a href="Propylaea">Propylaea</a>. To the south of the entrance is the tiny <a href="Temple%20of%20Athena%20Nike">Temple of Athena Nike</a>. At the centre of the Acropolis is the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> or Temple of Athena Parthenos (Athena the Virgin). East of the entrance and north of the Parthenon is the temple known as the <a href="Erechtheum">Erechtheum</a>. South of the platform that forms the top of the Acropolis there are also the remains of the ancient, though often remodelled, <a href="Theatre%20of%20Dionysus">Theatre of Dionysus</a>. A few hundred metres away, there is the now partially reconstructed <a href="Odeon%20of%20Herodes%20Atticus">Odeon of Herodes Atticus</a>.

All the valuable ancient artifacts are situated in the <a href="Acropolis%20Museum">Acropolis Museum</a>, which resides on the southern slope of the same rock, 280 metres from the Parthenon.

The Project began in 1975 and is now nearing completion. The aim of the restoration was to reverse the decay of centuries of attrition, pollution, destruction stemming from military use, and misguided past restorations. The project included collection and identification of all stone fragments, even small ones, from the Acropolis and its slopes and the attempt was made to restore as much as possible using reassembled original material (<a href="anastylosis">anastylosis</a>), with new marble from <a href="Mount%20Penteli">Mount Penteli</a> used sparingly. All restoration was made using <a href="titanium">titanium</a> dowels and is designed to be completely reversible, in case future experts decide to change things. A combination of cutting-edge modern technology and extensive research and reinvention of ancient techniques were used.

The Parthenon colonnades, largely destroyed by Venetian bombardment in the 17th century, were restored, with many wrongly assembled columns now properly placed. The roof and floor of the Propylaea were partly restored, with sections of the roof made of new marble and decorated with blue and gold inserts, as in the original. Restoration of the Temple of Athena Nike was completed in 2010.

A total of 2,675 tons of architectural members were restored, with 686 stones reassembled from fragments of the originals, 905 patched with new marble, and 186 parts made entirely of new marble. A total of 530 cubic meters of new Pentelic marble were used.

Every four years, the Athenians held a festival called the <a href="Panathenaea">Panathenaea</a> that rivaled the <a href="Ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> in popularity. During the festival, a procession (believed to be depicted on the Parthenon frieze) traveled through the city via the Panathenaic Way and culminated on the Acropolis. There, a new robe of woven wool ("<a href="peplos">peplos</a>") was placed on either the statue of Athena Polias in the Erechtheum (during a regular Panathenaea) or on the statue of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon (during the Great Panathenaea, held every four years).

Within the later tradition of <a href="Western%20Civilization">Western Civilization</a> and <a href="classicism">classical revival</a> the Acropolis, from at least the mid-18th century on, has often been invoked as a key symbol of the Greek legacy and of the glories of <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical Greece</a>.

Adam Weishaupt

Johann Adam Weishaupt ( 6 February 1748 –) was a <a href="Germans">German</a> philosopher and founder of the <a href="Illuminati">Order of the Illuminati</a>, a secret society.

Adam Weishaupt was born on 6 February 1748 in <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a> in the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Electorate of Bavaria</a>. Weishaupt's father <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Weishaupt">Johann Georg Weishaupt</a> (1717–1753) died when Adam was five years old. After his father's death he came under the tutelage of his <a href="Godparent">godfather</a> <a href="Johann%20Adam%20von%20Ickstatt">Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt</a> who, like his father, was a professor of law at the <a href="University%20of%20Ingolstadt">University of Ingolstadt</a>. Ickstatt was a proponent of the philosophy of <a href="Christian%20Wolff%20%28philosopher%29">Christian Wolff</a> and of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, and he influenced the young Weishaupt with his <a href="rationalism">rationalism</a>. Weishaupt began his formal education at age seven at a <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> school. He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768 at age 20 with a <a href="Juris%20Doctor">doctorate of law</a>. In 1772 he became a professor of law. The following year he married Afra Sausenhofer of <a href="Eichst%C3%A4tt">Eichstätt</a>.

After <a href="Pope%20Clement%20XIV">Pope Clement XIV</a>’s <a href="suppression%20of%20the%20Society%20of%20Jesus">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a> in 1773, Weishaupt became a professor of <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>, a position that was held exclusively by the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a> until that time. In 1775 Weishaupt was introduced to the <a href="Empiricism">empirical</a> philosophy of <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Heinrich%20Feder">Johann Georg Heinrich Feder</a> of the <a href="Georg-August%20University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a>. Both Feder and Weishaupt would later become opponents of <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kantian</a> <a href="idealism">idealism</a>.

On 1 May 1776 Johann Adam Weishaupt founded the "Illuminati" in the Electorate of Bavaria. He adopted the name of "Brother <a href="Spartacus">Spartacus</a>" within the order. Even Encyclopedia references vary on the goal of the order, such as New Advent saying the Order was not <a href="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> or democratic internally, but sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society; while others like Collier's have said the aim was to combat religion and foster rationalism in its place.

The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies. Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know: a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.

Weishaupt was initiated into the <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a> "Theodor zum guten Rath", at Munich in 1777. His project of "illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice" was an unwelcome reform. He used Freemasonry to recruit for his own quasi-masonic society, with the goal of "perfecting human nature" through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. Presenting their own system as pure masonry, Weishaupt and <a href="Adolph%20Freiherr%20Knigge">Adolph Freiherr Knigge</a>, who organised his ritual structure, greatly expanded the secret organisation.

Contrary to Immanuel Kant's that <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> (and Weishaupt's Order was in some respects an expression of the Enlightenment Movement) was the passage by man out of his 'self-imposed immaturity' through daring to 'make use of his own reason, without the guidance of another,' Weishaupt's Order of Illuminati prescribed in great detail everything which the members had obediently to read and think, so that Dr. Wolfgang Riedel has commented that this approach to illumination or enlightenment constituted a degradation and twisting of the Kantian principle of Enlightenment. Riedel writes:
'The independence of thought and judgement required by Kant ... was specifically prevented by the Order of the Illuminati's rules and regulations. Enlightenment takes place here, if it takes place at all, precisely "under" the direction of another, namely under that of the "Superiors" [of the Order].

Weishaupt's radical rationalism and vocabulary were not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of <a href="Charles%20Theodore%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Karl Theodor</a>, Elector of Bavaria, in 1784. Weishaupt lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria.

He received the assistance of <a href="Ernest%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg">Duke Ernest II</a> of <a href="Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg">Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg</a> (1745–1804), and lived in <a href="Gotha%20%28town%29">Gotha</a> writing a series of works on illuminism, including "A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria" (1785), "A Picture of Illuminism" (1786), "An Apology for the Illuminati" (1786), and "An Improved System of Illuminism" (1787). 

After Weishaupt's Order of Illuminati was banned,Weishaupt did found new order of Illuminati in 1788.
Order is still active today.

Weishaupt's character and intentions have been variously assessed: from those such as the Abbé Barruel and John Robison who regarded him as a 'human devil' and saw his mission as one of malevolent destructiveness, to those who view him as a humane and benign, albeit wilful, social reformer. Writing on this topic, Dr. Tony Page comments:

"Weishaupt’s plan was to educate Illuminati followers in the highest levels of humanity and morality (basing his teachings on the supremacy of Reason, allied with the spirit of the Golden Rule of not doing to others what one would not wish done to oneself), so that if Illuminati alumni subsequently attained positions of significance and power (such as in the fields of education and politics), they could exert a benevolent and uplifting influence upon society at large. His project was utopian and naively optimistic, and he himself was certainly not without flaws of character – but neither he nor his plan was evil or violent in and of themselves. It is one of the deplorable and tragic ironies of history that a man who tried to inculcate virtue, philanthropy, social justice and morality has become one of the great hate-figures of 21st-century ‘conspiracy’ thinking."

Adam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in "<a href="The%20Illuminatus%21%20Trilogy">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a>", written by <a href="Robert%20Shea">Robert Shea</a> and <a href="Robert%20Anton%20Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a>, as the founder of the <a href="Illuminati">Illuminati</a> and as an impostor who killed <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and took his place as the first president of the United States. Washington's portrait on the <a href="U.S.%20one-dollar%20bill">U.S. one-dollar bill</a> is said to actually be Weishaupt's.

Another version of Adam Weishaupt appears in the extensive comic book novel "<a href="Cerebus%20the%20Aardvark">Cerebus the Aardvark</a>" by <a href="Dave%20Sim">Dave Sim</a>, as a combination of Weishaupt and George Washington. He appears primarily in the "Cerebus" and "<a href="Church%20%26amp%3B%20State%20I">Church & State I</a>" volumes. His motives are <a href="republic">republic</a>an confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.

Weishaupt's name is one of many references made to the <a href="Illuminati">Illuminati</a> and other conspiracies in the video game "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>" (2000). The protagonist uncovers a virus engineered by the VersaLife Corporation with its molecular structure in multiples of <a href="23%20enigma">17 and 23</a>. An ally of the protagonist notes "1723.

Acorn Electron

The Acorn Electron is a budget version of the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a> educational/<a href="home%20computer">home computer</a> made by <a href="Acorn%20Computers%20Ltd">Acorn Computers Ltd</a>. It has 32 <a href="kilobyte">kilobyte</a>s of <a href="Random%20Access%20Memory">RAM</a>, and its <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a> includes <a href="BBC%20BASIC">BBC BASIC</a> v2 along with its <a href="Acorn%20MOS">operating system</a>.

The Electron was able to save and load programs onto <a href="compact%20audio%20cassette">audio cassette</a> via a supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard <a href="tape%20recorder">tape recorder</a> that had the correct sockets. It was capable of basic graphics, and could display onto either a television set, a colour (<a href="RGB">RGB</a>) monitor or a "<a href="Green-screen%20display">green screen</a>" monitor.

For a short period, the Electron was reportedly the best selling micro in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

After <a href="Acorn%20Computer">Acorn Computer</a> released the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, executives believed that the company needed a less-expensive computer for the mass market. In June 1982, cofounder <a href="Hermann%20Hauser">Hermann Hauser</a> was asked about the recently announced £175 <a href="Sinclair%20ZX%20Spectrum">Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a>'s potential to hurt sales of the BBC Micro. Hauser responded that in the third quarter of that year Acorn would release a new £120-150 computer which "will probably be called the Electron", with graphics superior to the Spectrum's and compatibility with BBC Micro software. Acorn's <a href="Chris%20Curry">Chris Curry</a> stated that "the Electron is designed to compete with the Spectrum. The idea is to get the starting price very low, but not preclude expansion in the long term." The company reduced the number of chips in the Electron by 90% from the BBC Micro's about 100, with most functionality on a single <a href="Uncommitted%20Logic%20Array">Uncommitted Logic Array</a> (ULA). Problems with the ULA delayed the Electron, however, and Acorn repeatedly missed deadlines to ship the computer.

Acorn formally announced the Electron at the <a href="Acorn%20User">"Acorn User" Exhibition</a> in August 1983, one year after Hauser mentioned the computer, by which time its price had risen to £175 while the Spectrum cost £130. The company expected to ship the Electron before Christmas, and sell 100,000 by February 1984. Reviews were generally favorable, noting its excellent graphics compared to the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>. While its speed was acceptable compared to the Commodore and competing computers the Electron was, however, much slower than the BBC Micro; "<a href="Popular%20Computing%20Weekly">Popular Computing Weekly</a>" reported, for example, that BBC Micro games ran "at less than half the speed, with very significant effects on their appeal".

The reduced processor speed was attributable to the use of a 4 bit wide memory system instead of the 8 bit wide memory system of the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a> to reduce cost. The Electron used just 4 64kbit RAM devices instead of the 16 16kbit RAM devices deployed on the BBC Model B. In the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, the RAM ran at 2x the speed (4 MHz) of the CPU (2 MHz) allowing the video (screen refresh) and CPU memory access to be cleverly interleaved. On the Electron two accesses had to be made to get an 8 bit word, meaning that the CPU was unable to access its RAM while screen refresh accesses were happening. This reduced the effective CPU speed by as much as a factor of 6. At the same time the <a href="BBC%20Micro%23B.2B64%20and%20B.2B128">BBC Micro B+</a> was being developed just metres away in the same Laboratory. This model used 8 64kbit RAMs enabling the screen memory to be overlayed with the BASIC and OS ROMs in the processor memory map. This allowed the full 32k byte program RAM to be used in addition to using a 20kbyte memory mapped screen.

The ULA continued to cause problems, delaying large-scale manufacturing. By October 1983 Acorn had received orders for more than 150,000 units, and expected to produce 25,000 a month before Christmas; the existing backlog would take more than six months to fulfill. Demand for the Electron was high but only two of <a href="WH%20Smith">WH Smith</a>'s London branches had inventory. As the company increased production during 1984, however, the British home-computer market greatly weakened; one Acorn executive later said, "after Christmas [1983] they were just delivering and the company ended up with £43 million of unsaleable stock". Acorn's Christmas 1984 sales were greatly below expectations and in January 1985 the company reduced the Electron's price to £129. In conjunction with an unsuccessful expansion into the United States, by February Acorn's <a href="market%20capitalization">market capitalization</a> declined 85% from the previous year. <a href="Olivetti">Olivetti</a> acquired the company later that year and <a href="Dixons%20Retail">Dixons Retail</a> acquired the remaining Electron inventory for less than manufacturing cost, ending Acorn's home-computer business.

With hindsight, the machine lacked the RAM (a typical program would need to fit in only around 20 kB once display memory is subtracted) and processing power to take on the prevailing Spectrum and Commodore 64. Despite this, several features that would later be associated with <a href="BBC%20Master">BBC Master</a> and <a href="Acorn%20Archimedes">Archimedes</a> were first features of Electron expansion units, including ROM cartridge slots and the <a href="Advanced%20Disc%20Filing%20System">Advanced Disc Filing System</a>, a hierarchical improvement to the BBC's original <a href="Disc%20Filing%20System">Disc Filing System</a>.

While it may not have been as popular as the Spectrum, Commodore 64 or <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a>, it did sell in sufficient numbers to ensure that new software was being produced right up until the early 1990s. This meant the Electron had a lifespan not much shorter than those more popular micros and much longer than competitors such as the <a href="Oric-1">Oric-1</a> and <a href="Dragon%2032">Dragon 32</a>.

The Acorn Plus 1 added two ROM cartridge slots, an analogue interface (supporting two channels) and a Centronics parallel port. The analogue interface was normally used for joysticks, the parallel for a printer. The ROM slots could be booted from via the "Shift+BREAK" key-combination. (The slot at the front of the interface took priority if both were populated).

Access to ROM memory occurred at 2 MHz regardless of graphics mode so theoretically programs released on ROM could run at least twice as fast as those released on tape or disc. Despite this all of the games released on ROM were packaged as "serial ROMS", from which the micro would load programs into main memory in exactly the same way as if it were loading from tape. This meant that programs did not need to be modified for their new memory location but gave no execution speed benefits.

The Cartridge-port ROM-slots provided additional control lines, (compared to the lines available via the Edge-connector on the rear of the Electron), such as ROMSTBY, SNDIN, ROMQA, and some additional Voltage sources (+16V) etc. The total number of lines exposed via the Cartridge port almost matched those from the 1 MHz bus of the BBC.

Additional peripheral cartridge-holders by companies such as P.R.E.S. (via their <a href="http%3A//www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/acp_pres.html">ARA/ARA2/ASR</a> products) allowed <a href="Sideways%20address%20space">'Sideways ROM'</a> capability, that allowed the standard Acorn ROM space to be programmatically mapped out for alternative EPROMs, either physically via ZIF Sockets, or 'virtually' via ROM-images loaded into (battery-backed) RAM in the same ROM memory space. This enabled the Electron to achieve the same functionality as that provided by the Expansion-ROM slots under the keyboard and on the bottom-left of the BBC Micro B keyboard.

The addition of the Plus 1 added a number of new *FX and OSBYTE calls that allowed the OS to read the values from the analogue and parallel interfaces.

The Plus 1 needed memory page &D for its workspace, and some games used this space. To disable the Plus 1, after pressing BREAK, the following commands could be issued:

Per a News article on Page #9 of the October 1984 issue of Acorn User, the Acorn 'Plus 2' interface was due to provide <a href="Econet">Econet</a> capability. This interface did not make it to market.

The Acorn Plus 3 was a hardware module that connected independently of the Plus 1 and provided a double-density 3½" disc drive connected through a <a href="WD1770">WD1770</a> drive controller and an <a href="Advanced%20Disc%20Filing%20System">ADFS</a> ROM. There were two versions of the Plus 3 produced: A Single-sided and a Double-sided drive version. Because the WD1770 is capable of single density mode and uses the same IBM360 derived floppy disc format as the Intel 8271 found in the BBC Micro, it was also possible to run a <a href="Disc%20Filing%20System">DFS</a> filing system with an alternate ROM, such as the P.R.E.S AP4 interface.

The Plus 3 reset PAGE to &1D00, reducing the amount of free RAM available to user. The ADFS system could be temporarily disabled (and PAGE reset to &E00) via the *NOADFS command. Alternative WD1770-based DFS and ADFS interfaces such as the P.R.E.S AP4 and 'ADFS E00' products left PAGE at &E00, and did not require the presence of the ZYSYSHELP file (see below)

Disks had to be manually mounted and dismounted using the *MOUNT / *DISMOUNT commands, or using the CTRL-A+BREAK key combination. Disks could also be booted from via the standard "Shift+BREAK" key-combination, if the ! BOOT file was present on the disk. This behaviour was the same as on the BBC Micro.

The Plus 3 included an uprated square black power supply unit with mains cord, manufactured by STC, designed and manufactured in England to BS 415 and BS 5850, that was designed to power the Plus 3, in addition to the Electron and the Plus 1 interface as well. This replaced the original cream-coloured "wall wart" style power supply, designed to BS 415 and manufactured in Hong Kong.


The original Electron Edge-connector was repeated on the back of the Plus3, in addition to a secondary smaller edge-connector, that enabled additional drives to be connected (<a href="Shugart%20bus">Shugart</a>-compatible connection). These required their own power-supply. The secondary edge-connector could not power external drives.

Repair note: If the internal power-supply connector, used to power the existing internal 3.5" drive is damaged, and requires replacement, then the original AMP 800-930 4-pin connector, which was already in short supply during the original production run, may be replaced with a Molex 5264 50-37-5043 "Mini-SPOX" connector as an alternative.

If using the Plus3 in screen modes 0-3, the pseudo-variable TIME would be thrown off, as the interrupts were disabled during disk access in these modes.

Per a News article on page 9 of the October 1984 issue of Acorn User, the Plus 3 was originally designed to have used the Intel 8272 disk controller, (and not 8271, which were in short supply at the time).

The ADFS file format used the bytes <a href="Advanced%20Disc%20Filing%20System">Hugo</a> to delimit the directory names on the disc, named after ADFS author Hugo Tyson. Another quirk was the presence of the file ZYSYSHELP which was required by the system, and created during formatting. This was a kludge. Acorn's v1.0 ADFS implementation on the Electron was unreliable when writing to the first few tracks of a floppy disc, so this was a "fix" and simply involved writing a file full of garbage to the suspect part. The ADFS would then skip it. Disc corruption could also occur if attempting to use the *COMPACT command without disabling the blinking cursor with the following command:

Disc formatting was done via the *EFORM command, vs the more familiar *FORM40/*FORM80 DFS commands. Note additionally that the *EFORM command differs from the equivalent *AFORM command for the 1770 ADFS on the BBC Microcomputer. This is possibly as a result of needing to create the ZYSYSHELP file on the Electron. The *EFORM command was only supplied on the Welcome disc that was shipped with the Plus3, and was not included in the ROM.

As a games machine the Electron shared the same failing as the Sinclair Spectrum in not having a joystick port. This was quickly remedied by First Byte Computers who developed an interface and software which allowed a "switched" joystick to be used with the majority of software titles. This interface became very popular and was sold by W.H. Smiths, Boots, Comet and hundreds of independent computer dealers.

The Advanced Plus 3 was very similar to the Acorn Plus 3 but packaged as an ADFS ROM cartridge for the Plus 1 with a disc drive connector at the head. This made it possible to connect a 5¼" floppy disc drive as used by BBC Micro owners or a more common 3½" drive.

<a href="http%3A//www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/acp_pres.html">AP5</a> Provided User Port (all lines), 1 MHz bus and 'Tube' bus capability, enabling second processor usage.
For the PRES5, and other similar interfaces, the User Port is usually implemented via a 6522 VIA chip.

The Slogger and Elektuur Turbo Boards were born out of a hack initially devised at Acorn. By moving the lowest 8 kB of RAM outside of reach of the ULA, the CPU could always access it at 2 MHz. The tradeoff was that the screen could not be located in that 8 kB. In practice the operating system ROMs always put the screen into the top 24 kB and as a result this probably only broke compatibility with around 2% of software.

The Slogger Turbo Board was a professionally fitted upgrade whereas the Elektuur modification was described in an article in Dutch Electronics magazine Elektuur and intended for users to perform at home.

Speeding up the low portion of memory is particularly useful on 6502 derived machines because that processor has a faster addressing mode for the first 256 bytes and so it is common for software to put any variables involved in time critical sections of program into that region.

If Acorn had thought to include this small modification in the original Electron design it is likely the machine would have had a much greater impact as it would have nearly doubled the amount of motion possible in games and saved modes 0–3 (including the only 16 colour mode) from being nearly useless due to contended memory timings.

A development of the Turbo Board, the Master RAM Board duplicated the Turbo Board functionality and added a further option of running the micro with 32 kB of shadow RAM in addition to the ordinary 32 kB — giving 64 kB total. Some clever program counter catches meant that the ordinary system ROMs and any software using the OS calls could function without significant modification, making substantially more memory available for BASIC, View, Viewsheet and almost every other business application. By providing extra storage this modification also allowed some games and applications intended for the BBC Micro to function on the Electron despite the lack of a native Mode 7.

Applications could not directly address video memory in this mode without modification, so it was incompatible with most games, although there is no inherent reason why a game could not be written to function in shadow mode.

During its decline, Master RAM Boards were added to every Electron in an attempt to increase sales.

Of the capabilities present in the BBC Micro but absent from the Electron, the <a href="teletext">teletext</a>-style "mode 7" was particularly conspicuous because of the very low memory usage in that mode (just less than 1 kB) and the high number of BBC programs that used it. <a href="http%3A//www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/jafa.html">Jafa Systems</a> provided a number of solutions to redress this deficiency. (Note - the Jafa interface did not provide Teletext interface itself, but it did work in conjunction with specific CEEFAX/Teletext/Prestel adaptors from other manufacturers such as Morley)

The most basic solution was a pure software system supplied on a ROM cartridge that drew a low resolution approximation of the mode 7 display in a graphics mode. Although cheap and effective in enabling use of some software that only used official ROM entry points for text output, this solution proved very slow because the Electron had to be placed into an 80-byte-pitch display to be able to get anywhere near to reproducing mode 7 and the CPU spent a lot of time drawing approximations of mode 7 characters and graphics that in a hardware solution would be achieved without any CPU processing. It also used up 20 kB of RAM for the graphics display rather than the 1 kB of a hardware mode 7.

Two solutions with additional hardware were provided. The first used the same graphics processor as the BBC Micro in mode 7 — the <a href="SAA5050">SAA5050</a> — but used software to ensure that it was fed with the correct graphics data. A software ROM would put the machine into an ordinary 40-byte-pitch display. While the ULA would read the display from memory in the usual fashion, the SAA5050 would listen to the data it was reading and produce a mode 7 interpretation of the same information. When necessary the hardware would switch between the graphics output being produced by the micro and that being produced by the add-on.

The disadvantage to this system is that while the SAA5050 would expect to be repeatedly fed the same 40 bytes of data for every display scanline of each character row, the ULA would read a different set of 40 bytes for every display scanline in order to produce a full graphics display. A software ROM worked around this by duplicating the data intended for a mode 7 display in memory. Although this produced a mode 7 that barely impacted upon CPU performance and gave the same visual quality as the BBC Micro, it remained compatible only with software that used the ROM routines for outputting text and graphics and still used 10 kB of memory for the display.

A second version of the hardware add-on corrected these problems. By adding a <a href="CRTC6845">CRTC6845</a> to the package, a full hardware solution was created that did not reduce CPU performance and only used 1 kB of memory for the display. A software ROM was still supplied, but this did no more than expand the hardware ROM so that it knew mode 7 now existed and was able to switch into it.

During the latter years, PMS produced a <a href="http%3A//www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/aab/revs/pms/r-e2p.html">2nd Processor</a> specifically for the Electron. This provided an alternative to buying the combination of the P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 5 and Acorn 6502 2nd Processor.

An unusual variant of the Electron was sold by <a href="British%20Telecom">British Telecom</a> Business Systems as the BT Merlin M2105 Communications Terminal. This consisted of a de-badged Electron plus a large expansion unit containing 32 kB of RAM, 48 kB of ROM, a <a href="Centronics%20printer%20port">Centronics printer port</a> and a <a href="modem">modem</a>. The ROM firmware provided <a href="dial-up">dial-up</a> communications facilities. These were used by the <a href="Interflora">Interflora</a> florists network in the UK for over a decade.

The hardware of the BBC Micro was emulated by a single customized ULA chip designed by Acorn in conjunction with <a href="Ferranti">Ferranti</a>. It had feature limitations such as the inability to output more than one channel of sound or provide <a href="teletext">teletext</a> mode. By contrast, the BBC Micro was capable of three-way polyphony (plus one noise channel).

The edge-connector on the rear of the Electron exposed almost all the Bus lines, but not all. (The BBC Micro, courtesy of all its ports, exposed all lines.)

For Issue 1-4 motherboards, the ULA had an issue similar to those experienced by other socketed CPU's. Over time, the thermal heating and cooling could cause the ULA to rise slightly out of its socket just enough to cause the machine to start exhibiting 'hanging' or other startup-failure issues, such as a continuous 'startup beep'. This was despite a metal cover, and locking-bar mechanism designed to prevent this from occurring. Pushing down on the metal cover to reseat the ULA was normally sufficient to rectify these issues. Issue 5 and 6 boards utilized a different epoxy resin covering directly over the ULA, which resolved this issue.

The keyboard included a form of single-key keyword input, similar to that used on the <a href="Sinclair%20Spectrum">Sinclair Spectrum</a>, via the 'func' key. However, unlike the Spectrum, the single-keypress keyword-entry was optional, and keywords could be entered manually if preferred.

The ULA controlled memory access and was able to provide 32K × 8 bits of addressable RAM using 4 × 64K × 1-bit <a href="random-access%20memory">RAM</a> chips (4164). Due to needing two accesses to each chip instead of one, and the complications of the video hardware also needing access, reading or writing RAM was much slower than on the BBC Micro. This meant that although ROM applications ran at the same speed, there was a substantial speed decrease on applications running from RAM.


Like the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, the Electron was constrained by limited memory resources. Of the 32 kB RAM, 3½ kB was allocated to the OS at startup and at least 10 kB was taken up by the display buffer in contiguous display modes.

Due to the timing of interrupts it was possible to disable either the top 100 or bottom 156 lines of the display with palette changes. Many games took advantage of this, gaining storage by leaving non-graphical data in the disabled area.

Other games would load non-graphical data into the display, leaving it visible as regions of apparently randomly coloured pixels.

Although <a href="page%20flipping">page flipping</a> was a hardware possibility, the limited memory forced most applications to do all their drawing directly to the visible screen, often resulting in graphical <a href="Flicker%20%28screen%29">flicker</a> or visible redraw. A notable exception is <a href="Players%20%28publisher%29">Players</a>' "<a href="Joe%20Blade">Joe Blade</a>" series.

Although programs can alter the position of the screen in memory, the non-linear format of the display means that vertical scrolling can only be done in blocks of 8 pixels without further work.

"<a href="Firetrack">FireTrack</a>" exploits a division in the way the Electron handles its display — of the seven available graphics modes, two are configured so that the final two of every ten scanlines are blank and are not based on the contents of RAM. If 16 scanlines of continuous graphical data are written to a character-block-aligned portion of the screen then they will appear as a continuous block in most modes but in the two non-continuous modes they will be displayed as two blocks of eight scanlines, separated in the middle by two blank scanlines.

In order to keep track of its position within the display, the Electron maintains an internal display address counter. The same counter is used in both the continuous and non-continuous graphics modes and switching modes mid-frame does not cause any adjustment to the counter.

"FireTrack" switches from a non-continuous to a continuous graphics mode part way down the display. By using the palette to mask the top area of the display and taking care about when it changes mode it can shift the continuous graphics at the bottom of the display down in two pixel increments because the internal display counter is not incremented on blank scanlines during non-continuous graphics modes.

"<a href="Exile%20%281988%20video%20game%29">Exile</a>" turns the Electron's one channel output into a digital speaker for <a href="Pulse-code%20modulation">PCM</a> output.

The speaker can be programmatically switched on or off at any time but is permanently attached to a hardware counter so is normally only able to output a square wave. But if set to a frequency outside the human audible range then the ear can't perceive the square wave, only the difference between the speaker being switched on and off. This gives the effect of a simple toggle speaker similar to that seen in the 48 kB <a href="Sinclair%20ZX%20Spectrum">Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a>. "Exile" uses this to output 1-bit audio samples.

Aardvark Software's "<a href="Frak%21">Frak!</a>" and "Zalaga" As part of the copy protection, illegal copies of the games would cause a pseudo-polyphonic rendition of Trumpet Hornpipe, the <a href="Captain%20Pugwash">Captain Pugwash</a> theme tune, to play endlessly rather than loading the game properly (Pugwash being a pirate). On the Electron version of Frak!, the tune was the main theme from "Benny Hill" (<a href="Boots%20Randolph">Boots Randolph</a>'s "<a href="Yakety%20Sax">Yakety Sax</a>"). The polyphony was achieved via fast note-switching to achieve the necessary chords.

Although not as well supported by the biggest software publishers as rivals like the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="Sinclair%20ZX%20Spectrum">Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a>, a good range of games were available for the Electron. The traditional <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a> publishers such as <a href="Acornsoft">Acornsoft</a>, <a href="Superior%20Software">Superior Software</a> and <a href="Micro%20Power">Micro Power</a> offered the widest support. Notable popular games particularly associated with the Electron include:

There were also many popular games officially converted to the Electron from arcade machines (including "<a href="Crystal%20Castles%20%28video%20game%29">Crystal Castles</a>", "<a href="Tempest%20%28arcade%20game%29">Tempest</a>", "<a href="Commando%20%28arcade%20game%29">Commando</a>", "<a href="Paperboy%20%28video%20game%29">Paperboy</a>" and "<a href="Yie%20Ar%20Kung-Fu">Yie Ar Kung-Fu</a>") or other home computer systems (including "<a href="Impossible%20Mission">Impossible Mission</a>", "<a href="Jet%20Set%20Willy">Jet Set Willy</a>", "<a href="The%20Way%20of%20the%20Exploding%20Fist">The Way of the Exploding Fist</a>", "<a href="Tetris">Tetris</a>", "<a href="The%20Last%20Ninja">The Last Ninja</a>", "<a href="Barbarian%20%28computer%20game%29">Barbarian</a>" and "<a href="SimCity%20%281989%20video%20game%29">SimCity</a>").

Despite Acorn themselves effectively shelving the Electron in 1985, games continued to be developed and released by professional software houses until 1991. There were around 1,400 games released for the Acorn Electron, several thousand extra public domain titles were released on disc through Public Domain libraries. Notable enterprises which produced discs of such software are <a href="BBC%20PD">BBC PD</a>, <a href="EUG%20%28Electron%20User%20Group%29">Electron User Group</a> and <a href="HeadFirst%20PD">HeadFirst PD</a>.

Three emulators of the machine exist, <a href="ElectrEm">ElectrEm</a> for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>/<a href="Linux">Linux</a>/<a href="macOS">macOS</a>, Elkulator for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>/<a href="DOS">DOS</a>, ElkJS is a browser-based (JavaScript/HTML5) Emulator and the Multi-system emulator <a href="MESS">MESS</a>. Electron software is predominantly archived in the <a href="UEF%20%28file%20format%29">UEF</a> <a href="file%20format">file format</a>.

The operating system ROM locations 0xFC00-0xFDFF contain the following text, which is different from the 'thanks' list in the original <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Model B</a>:

Additionally, the last bytes of both the BASIC ROM and 'Plus 3 Interface' ADFS v1.0 ROM include the word "Roger", thought to be a reference to <a href="Sophie%20Wilson">Roger Wilson</a>.

The novel is set in various locations in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. The galaxy is divided into four concentric volumes called the "Zones of Thought"; it is not clear to the novel's characters whether this is a natural phenomenon or an artificially-produced one, but it seems to roughly correspond with galactic-scale stellar density and a Beyond region is mentioned in the <a href="Sculptor%20Galaxy">Sculptor Galaxy</a> as well. The Zones reflect fundamental differences in basic physical laws, and one of the main consequences is their effect on intelligence, both biological and artificial. Artificial intelligence and automation is most directly affected, in that advanced hardware and software from the Beyond or the Transcend will work less and less well as a ship "descends" towards the Unthinking Depths. But even biological intelligence is affected to a lesser degree. The four zones are spoken of in terms of "low" to "high" as follows:


An expedition from Straumli Realm, an ambitious young human civilization in the high Beyond, investigates a five-billion-year-old data archive in the low Transcend that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches. The expedition's facility, High Lab, is gradually compromised by a dormant <a href="superintelligence">superintelligence</a> within the archive later known as the Blight. However, shortly before the Blight's final "flowering", two self-aware entities created similarly to the Blight plot to aid the humans before the Blight can escape.

Recognizing the danger of what they have awakened, the researchers at High Lab attempt to flee in two ships, one carrying all the adults and the second carrying all the children in "<a href="suspended%20animation">coldsleep boxes</a>". Suspicious, the Blight discovers that the first ship contains a data storage device in its cargo manifest; assuming it contains information that could harm it, the Blight destroys the ship. The second ship escapes. The Blight assumes that it is no threat, but later realizes that it is actually carrying away a "countermeasure" against it.

The ship lands on a distant planet with a <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a>-level civilization of dog-like creatures, dubbed "Tines", who live in packs as <a href="Group%20mind%20%28science%20fiction%29">group minds</a>. Upon landing, however, the two surviving adults are ambushed and killed by Tine fanatics known as Flenserists, in whose realm they have landed. The Flenserists capture a young boy named Jefri Olsndot and his wounded sister, Johanna. While Jefri is taken deeper into Flenserist territory, Johanna is rescued by Tine pilgrims who witnessed the ambush and deliver her to a neighboring kingdom ruled by a Tine named Woodcarver. The Flenserists tell Jefri that Johanna had been killed by Woodcarver and exploit him in order to develop advanced technology (such as cannon and radio communication), while Johanna and the knowledge stored in her "dataset" device help Woodcarver rapidly develop in turn.

A distress signal from the sleeper ship eventually reaches "Relay", a major node in the galactic communications network. A benign transcendent entity named "Old One" contacts Relay, seeking information about the Blight and the humans who released it, and reconstitutes a human man named Pham Nuwen from an old wreck to act as its agent, using his doubt of his own memory's veracity to bend him to the Old One's will. Ravna Bergsndot, the only human Relay employee, traces the sleeper ship's signal to the Tines world and persuades her employer to investigate what the human ship took from High Lab, contracting the merchant vessel "Out of Band II", owned by two sentient plant Skroderiders, Blueshell and Greenstalk, to transport them.

Before the mission is launched, the Blight attacks Relay and concurrently kills Old One. As Old One dies, it downloads what information it can into Pham to defeat the Blight, and Pham and Ravna barely escape Relay's destruction in the "Out of Band II".

The Blight expands, taking over races and "rewriting" their people to become its agents, murdering several other Powers, and seizing other archives in the Beyond, looking for what was taken. It finally realizes where the danger truly lies and sends a hastily assembled fleet in pursuit of the "Out of Band II".

The humans arrive at the Tines homeworld and ally with Woodcarver to defeat the Flenserists. Pham initiates Countermeasure, which extends the Slow Zone by thousands of light years, enveloping the Blight at the cost of wrecking thousands of uninvolved civilizations and causing trillions of deaths. The humans are stranded on the Tines world, now in the depths of the "Slow Zone". Activating the countermeasure costs Pham his life, but just before Pham dies, he realizes that, although his body is a reconstruction, his memories are real. Vinge expands on Pham's backstory in "<a href="A%20Deepness%20in%20the%20Sky">A Deepness in the Sky</a>".

A race of humanoids with colorful butterfly-like wings who attempt to use the chaos wrought by the Blight to reestablish their waning hegemony. Despite their attractive, delicate appearance, the Aprahanti are an extremely fearsome and vicious species.

An ancient, malevolent super-intelligent entity which strives to constantly expand and can easily manipulate electronics and even organic beings.

An older race which originally inhabited Sjandra Kei before the arrival of humanity.

All humans in the novel (except Pham) are descended from Nyjoran stock. Their ancestors were "Tuvo-Norsk" asteroid miners from Old Earth's solar system, which is noted as being on the other side of the galaxy in the Slow Zone. ("Nyjora" sounds similar to <a href="New%20Norwegian">New Norwegian</a> "New Earth".) One of the major human habitations is Sjandra Kei, three systems comprising roughly 28 billion individuals. Their main language is <a href="Norwegian%20language">Samnorsk</a>, the Norwegian term for a hypothetical unification of the <a href="Bokm%C3%A5l">Bokmål</a> and <a href="Nynorsk">Nynorsk</a> forms of the language. (Vinge indicates in the book's dedication that several key ideas in it came to him while at a conference in Tromsø, Norway.)

A <a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a> race of plants with fronds that are used for expression. Five billion years ago, someone gave them wheeled mechanical constructs (skrodes) to move around and to provide short-term memory. It is later revealed that their "benefactor" was the Blight, and it is able to corrupt and operate the Riders via their skrodes.

A <a href="Canidae">canid</a> race, each "person" comprising a group mind of 4–8 members, connected by ultrasonic waves. Each "soul" can survive and evolve by adding members to replace those who die, potentially for hundreds of years, as Woodcarver does.

A race of insectoid humanoids which constitutes one of the "majority races" of the Vrinimi organization.

Vinge first used the concepts of "Zones of Thought" in a 1988 novella, "<a href="The%20Blabber">The Blabber</a>", which occurs after "Fire". Vinge's novel "<a href="A%20Deepness%20in%20the%20Sky">A Deepness in the Sky</a>" (1999) is a prequel to "A Fire Upon the Deep" set 20,000 years earlier and featuring Pham Nuwen. Vinge's "<a href="The%20Children%20of%20the%20Sky">The Children of the Sky</a>", "a near-term sequel to "A Fire Upon the Deep", set ten years later, was released in October 2011.

Vinge's former wife, <a href="Joan%20D.%20Vinge">Joan D. Vinge</a>, has also written stories in the Zones of Thought universe, based on his notes. These include "The Outcasts of Heaven Belt", "Legacy", and a planned novel featuring Pham Nuwen.

Vinge's original title for the novel was "Among the Tines"; its final title was suggested by his editors.

"A Fire Upon the Deep" shared the 1993 <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Hugo Award for Best Novel</a> with "<a href="Doomsday%20Book%20%28novel%29">Doomsday Book</a>". The book was nominated for the 1992 <a href="Nebula%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Nebula Award for Best Novel</a>, the 1993 <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell%20Memorial%20Award%20for%20Best%20Science%20Fiction%20Novel">John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel</a>, and the 1993 <a href="Locus%20Award">Locus Award</a> for Best Science Fiction Novel.

<a href="Jo%20Walton">Jo Walton</a> wrote: "Any one of the ideas in "A Fire Upon the Deep" would have kept an ordinary writer going for years. For me it's the book that does everything right, the example of what science fiction does when it works. ... "A Fire Upon the Deep" remains a favourite and a delight to re-read, absorbing even when I know exactly what’s coming."

Aeronautics

Aeronautics (from the <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> words ὰήρ "āēr", which means "air", and ναυτική "nautikē" which means "navigation", i.e. "navigation into the air") is the science or art involved with the study, <a href="design%20process">design</a>, and manufacturing of air <a href="flight">flight</a> capable machines, and the techniques of operating <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> and rockets within the atmosphere. The British <a href="Royal%20Aeronautical%20Society">Royal Aeronautical Society</a> identifies the aspects of "aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering" and "the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics)." 

While the term—literally meaning "sailing the air"—originally referred solely to the science of "operating" the aircraft, it has since been expanded to include technology, business, and other aspects related to aircraft. 
The term "<a href="aviation">aviation</a>" is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although "aeronautics" includes <a href="lighter-than-air">lighter-than-air</a> craft such as <a href="airship">airship</a>s, and includes <a href="ballistic%20vehicle">ballistic vehicle</a>s while "aviation" technically does not.

A significant part of aeronautical science is a branch of <a href="dynamics%20%28mechanics%29">dynamics</a> called <a href="aerodynamics">aerodynamics</a>, which deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

Attempts to fly without any real aeronautical understanding have been made from the earliest times, typically by constructing wings and jumping from a tower with crippling or lethal results.

Wiser investigators sought to gain some rational understanding through the study of bird flight. An early example appears in ancient Egyptian texts. Later medieval Islamic scientists also made such studies. The founders of modern aeronautics, <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> in the Renaissance and Cayley in 1799, both began their investigations with studies of bird flight.

Man-carrying kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient China. In 1282 the European explorer <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a> described the Chinese techniques then current. The Chinese also constructed small hot air balloons, or lanterns, and rotary-wing toys.

An early European to provide any scientific discussion of flight was <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a>, who described principles of operation for the lighter-than-air <a href="Balloon%20%28aircraft%29">balloon</a> and the flapping-wing <a href="ornithopter">ornithopter</a>, which he envisaged would be constructed in the future. The lifting medium for his balloon would be an "aether" whose composition he did not know.

In the late fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci followed up his study of birds with designs for some of the earliest flying machines, including the flapping-wing <a href="ornithopter">ornithopter</a> and the rotating-wing <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>. Although his designs were rational, they were not based on particularly good science. Many of his designs, such as a four-person screw-type helicopter, have severe flaws. He did at least understand that "An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object." (<a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton</a> would not publish the <a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion%23Newton.27s%20third%20law">Third law of motion</a> until 1687.) His analysis led to the realisation that manpower alone was not sufficient for sustained flight, and his later designs included a mechanical power source such as a spring. Da Vinci's work was lost after his death and did not reappear until it had been overtaken by the work of <a href="George%20Cayley">George Cayley</a>.

The modern era of lighter-than-air flight began early in the 17th century with <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a>'s experiments in which he showed that air has weight. Around 1650 <a href="Cyrano%20de%20Bergerac">Cyrano de Bergerac</a> wrote some fantasy novels in which he described the principle of ascent using a substance (dew) he supposed to be lighter than air, and descending by releasing a controlled amount of the substance. <a href="Francesco%20Lana%20de%20Terzi">Francesco Lana de Terzi</a> measured the pressure of air at sea level and in 1670 proposed the first scientifically credible lifting medium in the form of hollow metal spheres from which all the air had been pumped out. These would be lighter than the displaced air and able to lift an <a href="airship">airship</a>. His proposed methods of controlling height are still in use today; by carrying ballast which may be dropped overboard to gain height, and by venting the lifting containers to lose height. In practice de Terzi's spheres would have collapsed under air pressure, and further developments had to wait for more practicable lifting gases.

From the mid-18th century the <a href="Montgolfier%20brothers">Montgolfier brothers</a> in France began experimenting with balloons. Their balloons were made of paper, and early experiments using steam as the lifting gas were short-lived due to its effect on the paper as it condensed. Mistaking smoke for a kind of steam, they began filling their balloons with hot smoky air which they called "electric smoke" and, despite not fully understanding the principles at work, made some successful launches and in 1783 were invited to give a demonstration to the French Academie des Sciences.

Meanwhile, the discovery of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> led <a href="Joseph%20Black">Joseph Black</a> in c. 1780 to propose its use as a lifting gas, though practical demonstration awaited a gastight balloon material. On hearing of the Montgolfier Brothers' invitation, the French Academy member <a href="Jacques%20Charles">Jacques Charles</a> offered a similar demonstration of a hydrogen balloon. Charles and two craftsmen, the Robert brothers, developed a gastight material of rubberised silk for the envelope. The hydrogen gas was to be generated by chemical reaction during the filling process.

The Montgolfier designs had several shortcomings, not least the need for dry weather and a tendency for sparks from the fire to set light to the paper balloon. The manned design had a gallery around the base of the balloon rather than the hanging basket of the first, unmanned design, which brought the paper closer to the fire. On their free flight, De Rozier and d'Arlandes took buckets of water and sponges to douse these fires as they arose. On the other hand, the manned design of Charles was essentially modern. As a result of these exploits, the hot-air ballon became known as the "Montgolfière" type and the hydrogen balloon the "Charlière".

Charles and the Robert brothers' next balloon, "<a href="Robert%20brothers%23Further%20ballooning%20activities%20%E2%80%93%20La%20Caroline">La Caroline</a>", was a Charlière that followed <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Meusnier">Jean Baptiste Meusnier</a>'s proposals for an elongated dirigible balloon, and was notable for having an outer envelope with the gas contained in a second, inner ballonet. On 19 September 1784, it completed the first flight of over 100 km, between Paris and <a href="Beuvry">Beuvry</a>, despite the man-powered propulsive devices proving useless.

In an attempt the next year to provide both endurance and controllability, de Rozier developed a balloon having both hot air and hydrogen gas bags, a design which was soon named after him as the "Rozière." The principle was to use the hydrogen section for constant lift and to navigate vertically by heating and allowing to cool the hot air section, in order to catch the most favourable wind at whatever altitude it was blowing. The balloon envelope was made of <a href="goldbeaters%20skin">goldbeaters skin</a>. The first flight ended in disaster and the approach has seldom been used since.

<a href="Sir%20George%20Cayley">Sir George Cayley</a> (1773-1857) is widely acknowledged as the founder of modern aeronautics. He was first called the "father of the aeroplane" in 1846 and Henson called him the "father of aerial navigation." He was the first true scientific aerial investigator to publish his work, which included for the first time the underlying principles and forces of flight.

In 1809 he began the publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled "On Aerial Navigation" (1809–1810). In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, "The whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air." He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: "<a href="thrust">thrust</a>", "<a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>", "<a href="Aerodynamic%20drag">drag</a>" and "<a href="weight">weight</a>" and distinguished stability and control in his designs.

He developed the modern conventional form of the fixed-wing aeroplane having a stabilising tail with both horizontal and vertical surfaces, flying gliders both unmanned and manned.

He introduced the use of the whirling arm test rig to investigate the aerodynamics of flight, using it to discover the benefits of the curved or <a href="camber%20%28aerodynamics%29">cambered</a> <a href="aerofoil">aerofoil</a> over the flat wing he had used for his first glider. He also identified and described the importance of <a href="Dihedral%20%28aircraft%29">dihedral</a>, diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of <a href="ornithopter">ornithopter</a>s and <a href="parachute">parachute</a>s.

Another significant invention was the tension-spoked wheel, which he devised in order to create a light, strong wheel for aircraft undercarriage.

During the 19th century Cayley's ideas were refined, proved and expanded on. Important investigators included <a href="Otto%20Lilienthal">Otto Lilienthal</a> and <a href="Horatio%20Phillips">Horatio Phillips</a>.

Aeronautics may be divided into three main branches comprising <a href="Aviation">Aviation</a>, <a href="Aeronautical%20science">Aeronautical science</a> and <a href="Aeronautical%20engineering">Aeronautical engineering</a>.

Aviation is the art or practice of aeronautics. Historically aviation meant only heavier-than-air flight, but nowadays it includes flying in balloons and airships.

Aeronautical science covers the practical theory of aeronautics and aviation, including operations, navigation, air safety and human factors.

A candidate pilot is likely to study for a qualification in aeronautical science.

Aeronautical engineering covers the design and construction of aircraft, including how they are powered, how they are used and how they are controlled for safe operation.

A major part of aeronautical engineering is aerodynamics, the science of passing through the air.

With the increasing activity in spaceflight, nowadays aeronautics and astronautics are often combined as <a href="aerospace%20engineering">aerospace engineering</a>.

The science of aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

The study of aerodynamics falls broadly into three areas:

"<a href="Incompressible%20flow">Incompressible flow</a>" occurs where the air simply moves to avoid objects, typically at subsonic speeds below that of sound (Mach 1).

"<a href="Compressible%20flow">Compressible flow</a>" occurs where shock waves appear at points where the air becomes compressed, typically at speeds above Mach 1.

"<a href="Transonic%20flow">Transonic flow</a>" occurs in the intermediate speed range around Mach 1, where the airflow over an object may be locally subsonic at one point and locally supersonic at another.

A <a href="rocket">rocket</a> or rocket vehicle is a <a href="missile">missile</a>, spacecraft, <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> or other <a href="vehicle">vehicle</a> which obtains <a href="thrust">thrust</a> from a <a href="rocket%20engine">rocket engine</a>. In all rockets, the exhaust is formed entirely from <a href="propellant">propellant</a>s carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by <a href="Reaction%20%28physics%29">action and reaction</a>. Rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.

Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th century <a href="China">China</a>. Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology of the <a href="Space%20Age">Space Age</a>, including <a href="Apollo%2011">setting foot on the moon</a>.

Rockets are used for <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a>, weaponry, <a href="ejection%20seat">ejection seat</a>s, <a href="launch%20vehicle">launch vehicle</a>s for <a href="artificial%20satellite">artificial satellite</a>s, <a href="human%20spaceflight">human spaceflight</a> and <a href="Space%20exploration">exploration</a> of other planets. While comparatively inefficient for low speed use, they are very lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining <a href="escape%20velocity">extremely high speeds</a> with reasonable efficiency.

<a href="Chemical%20rocket">Chemical rocket</a>s are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of <a href="rocket%20propellant">rocket propellant</a>. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.

Auguste and Louis Lumière

The Lumière () brothers, Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas (19 October 1862, <a href="Besan%C3%A7on">Besançon</a>, France – 10 April 1954, <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>) and Louis Jean (5 October 1864, <a href="Besan%C3%A7on">Besançon</a>, France – 6 June 1948, <a href="Bandol">Bandol</a>), were among the first <a href="film%20director">filmmakers</a> in history. They patented an improved <a href="cinematograph">cinematograph</a>, which in contrast to <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>'s "peepshow" <a href="kinetoscope">kinetoscope</a> allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple parties.

The Lumière brothers were born in <a href="Besan%C3%A7on">Besançon</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, to Charles-Antoine Lumière (1840–1911) and Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière, who were married in 1861 and moved to Besançon, setting up a small photographic portrait studio where Auguste and Louis were born. They moved to <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> in 1870, where son Edouard and three daughters were born. Auguste and Louis both attended <a href="La%20Martiniere%20Lyon">La Martiniere</a>, the largest technical school in Lyon. Their father Charles-Antoine set up a small factory producing photographic plates, but even with Louis and a young sister working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. it teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and by 1882 it looked as if they would fail, but when Auguste returned from military service the boys designed the machines necessary to automate their father's plate production and devised a very successful new photo plate, 'etiquettes bleue', and by 1884 the factory employed a dozen workers.
When their father retired in 1892 the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented several significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably <a href="film%20perforations">film perforations</a> (originally implemented by <a href="Emile%20Reynaud">Emile Reynaud</a>) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original <a href="cin%C3%A9matographe">cinématographe</a> had been patented by <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Guillaume%20Bouly">Léon Guillaume Bouly</a> on 12 February 1892. The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895. The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on 19 March 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.

The Lumières brothers saw film as a novelty and had withdrawn from the film business in 1905. They went on to develop the first practical photographic colour process, the Lumière Autochrome.
Auguste died on 10 April 1954 and Louis on 6 June 1948. They are buried in a family tomb in the <a href="New%20Guillotiere%20Cemetery">New Guillotiere Cemetery</a> in Lyon.

The Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895. This first screening on 22 March 1895 took place in Paris, at the "Society for the Development of the National Industry", in front of an audience of 200 people – among which <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Gaumont">Léon Gaumont</a>, then director of the Comptoir de la photographie. The main focus of this conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (colour photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the coloured stills photographs. The American <a href="Woodville%20Latham">Woodville Latham</a> had screened works of film seven months earlier on 20 May 1895. The first public screening of films at which admission was charged was a program by the Skladanowsky brothers that was held on 1 November 1895, in Berlin.

The Lumières gave their first paid public screening on 28 December 1895, at <a href="Salon%20Indien%20du%20Grand%20Caf%C3%A9">Salon Indien du Grand Café</a> in Paris. This history-making presentation featured 10 short films, including their first film, "<a href="Workers%20Leaving%20the%20Lumi%C3%A8re%20Factory">Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon</a>" ("Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory").
Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.

The public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following 10 short films (in order of presentation):


The Lumières went on tour with the cinématographe in 1896, visiting <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> (the first place a film was played outside Paris on the Galleries Saint-Hubert on 1 March 1896), <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>.

The moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with "<a href="L%27Arriv%C3%A9e%20d%27un%20Train%20en%20Gare%20de%20la%20Ciotat">L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat</a>" (literally, "the arrival of a train at La Ciotat", but more commonly known as "Arrival of a Train at a Station") and "<a href="Carmaux%2C%20d%C3%A9fournage%20du%20coke">Carmaux, défournage du coke</a>" (Drawing out the coke). Their <a href="actuality%20film">actuality film</a>s, or "actualités", are often cited as the first, primitive <a href="Documentary%20film">documentaries</a>. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of "<a href="L%27Arroseur%20Arros%C3%A9">L'Arroseur Arrosé</a>".

The brothers stated that "the <a href="film">cinema</a> is an <a href="invention">invention</a> without any future" and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as <a href="Georges%20M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s">Georges Méliès</a>. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography. They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process, a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process. In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the "<a href="Autochrome%20Lumi%C3%A8re">Autochrome Lumière</a>", which was launched on the market in 1907. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following merger with <a href="Ilford%20Photo">Ilford</a>. They also invented the colour plate, which really got photography on the road.

The Lumière Brothers were not the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The scientific <a href="chronophotography">chronophotography</a> devices developed by <a href="Eadweard%20Muybridge">Eadweard Muybridge</a>, <a href="%C3%89tienne-Jules%20Marey">Étienne-Jules Marey</a> and <a href="Ottomar%20Ansch%C3%BCtz">Ottomar Anschütz</a> in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, as was <a href="William%20Friese-Greene">William Friese-Greene</a>'s 'chronophotographic' system, demonstrated in 1890.<a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>'s <a href="Kinetoscope">Kinetoscope</a> (developed by W K-L Dickson), premiered in 1891.

Since 1892, the projected drawings of <a href="%C3%89mile%20Reynaud">Émile Reynaud</a>'s <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Optique">Théâtre Optique</a> were attracting Paris crowds to the Musée Grévin. <a href="Louis%20Le%20Prince">Louis Le Prince</a> and <a href="Claude%20Mechant">Claude Mechant</a> had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, <a href="Kazimierz%20Pr%C3%B3szy%C5%84ski">Kazimierz Prószyński</a> had built his camera and projecting device, called <a href="Pleograph">Pleograph</a>, in 1894. <a href="Max%20Skladanowsky">Max and Emil Skladanowsky</a>, inventors of the <a href="Bioscop">Bioscop</a>, had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (1 November 1895, in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.

Although the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.

Acts of the Apostles

Acts of the Apostles (, "Práxeis tôn Apostólōn"; ), often referred to simply as Acts, is the fifth book of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>; it tells of the founding of the <a href="Christian%20church">Christian church</a> and the spread of its message to the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>.

Acts and the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> make up a two-part work, <a href="Luke%E2%80%93Acts">Luke–Acts</a>, by the same anonymous author, usually dated to around 80–90 AD. The first part, the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, tells how <a href="God%20in%20Christianity">God</a> fulfilled his plan for the world's <a href="Salvation%20%28Christianity%29">salvation</a> through the life, death, and resurrection of <a href="Jesus%20of%20Nazareth">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, the promised <a href="Messiah">Messiah</a>. Acts continues the story of <a href="Christianity%20in%20the%201st%20century">Christianity in the 1st century</a>, beginning with Jesus's <a href="Ascension%20of%20Jesus">Ascension</a> to <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a>. The early chapters, set in <a href="Early%20centers%20of%20Christianity%23Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, describe the <a href="Pentecost">Day of Pentecost</a> (the coming of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>) and the growth of the church in Jerusalem. Initially, the Jews are receptive to the Christian message, but soon they turn against the followers of Jesus. Rejected by the Jews, under the guidance of the <a href="Apostle%20Peter">Apostle Peter</a> the message is taken to the <a href="Gentiles">Gentiles</a>. The later chapters tell of <a href="Conversion%20of%20Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul's conversion</a>, his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial.

Luke–Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the <a href="Rejection%20of%20Jesus">Jews rejected it</a>. Luke–Acts can be also seen as a defense of (or "apology" for) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews: the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences, with the Romans featuring as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law. On the one hand Luke portrays the <a href="Jewish%20Christian">Christians as a sect of the Jews</a>, and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion; on the other, Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians, celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God's promised Messiah.

The title "Acts of the Apostles" (<a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Greek</a> "Praxeis Apostolon") was first used by <a href="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a> in the late 2nd century. It is not known whether this was an existing title or one invented by Irenaeus; it does seem clear, however, that it was not given by the author.

The Gospel of Luke and Acts make up a two-volume work which scholars call <a href="Luke%E2%80%93Acts">Luke–Acts</a>. Together they account for 27.5% of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, the largest contribution attributed to a single author, providing the framework for both the Church's liturgical calendar and the historical outline into which later generations have fitted their idea of the story of Jesus and the early church.

The author is not named in either volume. According to Church tradition dating from the 2nd century, he was the "Luke" named as a companion of the <a href="apostle%20Paul">apostle Paul</a> in three of the letters attributed to Paul himself; this view is still sometimes advanced, but "a critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.") (An example can be seen by comparing Acts's accounts of Paul's conversion (Acts 9:1–31, 22:6–21, and 26:9–23) with Paul's own statement that he remained unknown to Christians in Judea after that event (Galatians 1:17–24).) He admired Paul, but his theology was significantly different from Paul's on key points and he does not (in Acts) represent Paul's views accurately. He was educated, a man of means, probably urban, and someone who respected manual work, although not a worker himself; this is significant, because more high-brow writers of the time looked down on the artisans and small business people who made up the early church of Paul and were presumably Luke's audience.

The earliest possible date for the composition of Acts is set by the events with which it ends, Paul's imprisonment in Rome c.63 AD, but an early date is now rarely put forward. The last possible date would be set by its first definite citation by another author, but there is no unanimity on this—some scholars find echoes of Acts in a work from c. 95 AD called <a href="I%20Clement">I Clement</a>, while others see no indisputable citation until the middle of the 2nd century. The majority of scholars date Luke–Acts to 80–90 AD, on the grounds that it uses Mark as a source and looks back on the destruction of Jerusalem, and does not show any awareness of the letters of Paul (which began circulating late in the century); if, however, it does show awareness of Paul and also of Josephus, then a date early in the 2nd century is more likely. In either case, there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.

Luke (or more accurately the anonymous author of Luke–Acts) aligned his work, Luke–Acts, to the "narratives" (διήγησις, "diēgēsis") which many others had written, and described his own work as an "orderly account" (ακριβώς καθέξης). Acts, the second part, is widely thought of as a history, but it lacks exact analogies in Hellenistic or Jewish literature. The title "Acts of the Apostles" ("Prαxeis Apostolon") would seem to identify it with the genre telling of the deeds and achievements of great men ("praxeis"), but it was not the title given by the author.

Luke seems to have taken as his model the works of two respected Classical authors, <a href="Dionysius%20of%20Halicarnassus">Dionysius of Halicarnassus</a>, who wrote a well-known history of Rome, and the Jewish historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, author of a <a href="Antiquities%20of%20the%20Jews">history of the Jews</a>. Like them, he anchors his history by dating the birth of the founder (Romulus for Dionysius, Moses for Josephus, Jesus for Luke) and like them he tells how the founder is born from God, taught authoritatively, and appeared to witnesses after death before ascending to heaven. By and large the sources for Acts can only be guessed at, but Luke would have had access to the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> (a Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures), the <a href="gospel%20of%20Mark">gospel of Mark</a> and the collection of "sayings of Jesus" called the <a href="Q%20source">Q source</a>. He transposed a few incidents from Mark's gospel to the time of the Apostles—for example, the material about "clean" and "unclean" foods in Mark 7 is used in Acts 10, and Mark's account of the accusation that Jesus has attacked the Temple (Mark 14:58) is used in a story about Stephen (Acts 6:14).) There are also points of contacts (meaning suggestive parallels but something less than clear evidence) with <a href="1%20Peter">1 Peter</a>, the <a href="Letter%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Letter to the Hebrews</a>, and 1 Clement. Other sources can only be inferred from internal evidence—the traditional explanation of the three "we" passages, for example, is that they represent eye-witness accounts. The search for such inferred sources was popular in the 19th century, but by the mid-20th it had largely been abandoned.

Acts was read as a reliable history of the early church well into the post-Reformation era. By the 17th century, however, biblical scholars began to notice that it was incomplete and tendentious—its picture of a harmonious church is quite at odds with that given by Paul's letters, and it omits important events such as the deaths of both Peter and Paul. The mid-19th-century scholar <a href="Ferdinand%20Christian%20Baur">Ferdinand Baur</a> suggested that Luke had re-written history to present a united Peter and Paul and advance a single orthodoxy against the <a href="Marcion">Marcion</a>ites. (Marcion was a 2nd-century heretic who wished to cut Christianity off entirely from the Jews). Baur continues to have enormous influence, but today there is less interest in determining Luke's historical accuracy (although this has never died out) than in understanding his theological program. In <a href="How%20Jesus%20Became%20Christian">How Jesus Became Christian</a> Canadian religious historian <a href="Barrie%20Wilson">Barrie Wilson</a> has renewed Baur's charge that Acts is a work of historical revisionism whose main purpose was to link Paul's new and separate Christ religion to Jesus and Judaism.

Luke was written to be read aloud to a group of Jesus-followers gathered in a house to share the Lord's supper. The author assumes an educated Greek-speaking audience, but directs his attention to specifically Christian concerns rather than to the Greco-Roman world at large. He begins his gospel with a preface addressed to <a href="Theophilus%20%28biblical%29">Theophilus</a>, informing him of his intention to provide an "ordered account" of events which will lead his reader to "certainty". He did not write in order to provide Theophilus with historical justification—"did it happen?"—but to encourage faith—"what happened, and what does it all mean?"

Acts (or Luke–Acts) is intended as a work of "edification." Edification means "the empirical demonstration that virtue is superior to vice," but is not all of Luke's purpose. He also engages with the question of a Christian's proper relationship with the Roman Empire, the civil power of the day: could a Christian obey God and also Caesar? The answer is ambiguous. The Romans never move against Jesus or his followers unless provoked by the Jews, in the trial scenes the Christian missionaries are always cleared of charges of violating Roman laws, and Acts ends with Paul in Rome proclaiming the Christian message under Roman protection; at the same time, Luke makes clear that the Romans, like all earthly rulers, receive their authority from Satan, while Christ is ruler of the <a href="kingdom%20of%20God">kingdom of God</a>.

There are two major textual variants of Luke–Acts, the <a href="Western%20text-type">Western text-type</a> and the <a href="Alexandrian%20text-type">Alexandrian</a>. The oldest complete Alexandrian manuscripts date from the 4th century and the oldest Western ones from the 6th, with fragments and citations going back to the 3rd. Western texts of Acts are 6.2–8.4% longer than Alexandrian texts, the additions tending to enhance the Jewish rejection of the Messiah and the role of the Holy Spirit, in ways that are stylistically different from the rest of Acts. These conflicts suggest that Luke–Acts was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century. The majority of scholars prefer the Alexandrian (shorter) text-type over the Western as the more authentic, but this same argument would favour the Western over the Alexandrian for the gospel of Luke, as in that case the, Western version is the shorter. The debate therefore continues.

Acts has two key structural principles. The first is the geographic movement from Jerusalem, centre of God's Covenantal people, the Jews, to Rome, centre of the Gentile world. This structure reaches back to the author's preceding work, the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, and is signaled by parallel scenes such as Paul's utterance in Acts 19:21, which echoes Jesus's words 9:51 (Paul has Rome as his destination, as Jesus had Jerusalem). The second key element is the roles of Peter and Paul, the first representing the Jewish Christian church, the second the mission to the Gentiles.


The <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> began with a prologue addressed to Theophilus; Acts likewise opens with an address to Theophilus and refers to "my earlier book", almost certainly the gospel.

The apostles and other followers of Jesus meet and elect Matthias to replace Judas as a member of The Twelve. On <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a>, the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> descends and confers God's power on them, and Peter, along with John, preaches to many in Jerusalem, and performs Christ-like healings, <a href="Exorcism">casting out of evil spirits</a>, and <a href="Resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">raising of the dead</a>. At first many <a href="Jewish%20Christians">Jews follow Christ</a> and are baptized, but the Christians begin to be increasingly <a href="Persecution%20of%20Christians%20in%20the%20New%20Testament">persecuted</a> by the Jews. <a href="Saint%20Stephen">Stephen</a> is arrested for <a href="blasphemy">blasphemy</a>, and after a trial, is found guilty and <a href="Stoning">stoned</a> by the Jews. Stephen's death marks a major turning point: the Jews have rejected the message, and henceforth it will be taken to the Gentiles.

The message is taken to the Samaritans, a people rejected by Jews, and to the <a href="Gentiles">Gentiles</a>. <a href="Saul%20of%20Tarsus">Saul of Tarsus</a>, one of the Jews who persecuted the Christians, is converted by a vision to become a follower of Christ (an event which Luke regards as so important that he relates it three times). Peter, directed by a series of visions, preaches to <a href="Cornelius%20the%20Centurion">Cornelius the Centurion</a>, a Gentile God-fearer, who becomes a follower of Christ. The Holy Spirit descends on Peter and Cornelius, thus confirming that the message of eternal life in Christ is for all mankind. The Gentile church is established in Antioch (north-western Syria, the third-largest city of the empire), and here Christ's followers are first called Christians.

The mission to the Gentiles is promoted from Antioch and confirmed at <a href="Council%20of%20Jerusalem">meeting in Jerusalem</a> between Paul and the leadership of the Jerusalem church. Paul spends the next few years traveling through western Asia Minor and the Aegean, preaching, converting Gentiles, and founding new churches. On a visit to Jerusalem he is set on by a Jewish mob. Saved by the Roman commander, he is accused by the Jews of being a <a href="zealot">revolutionary</a>, the "ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes", and imprisoned. Paul asserts his right as a Roman citizen, to be tried in Rome and is sent by sea to Rome, where he spends another two years under house arrest, proclaiming the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20God">Kingdom of God</a> and teaching the "Lord Jesus Christ". Acts ends abruptly without recording the outcome of Paul's legal troubles.

Prior to the 1950s, Luke–Acts was seen as a historical work, written to defend Christianity before the Romans or Paul against his detractors; since then, however, the tendency has been to see the work as primarily theological. Luke's theology is expressed primarily through his overarching plot, the way scenes, themes and characters combine to construct his specific worldview. His "salvation history" stretches from the Creation to the present time of his readers, in three ages: first, the time of "the Law and the Prophets" (Luke 16:16), the period beginning with Genesis and ending with the appearance of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5–3:1); second, the epoch of Jesus, in which the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20God">Kingdom of God</a> was preached (Luke 3:2–24:51); and finally the period of the Church, which began when the risen Christ was taken into Heaven, and would end with his <a href="second%20coming%20of%20Christ">second coming</a>.

Luke–Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah promised to the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it. This theme is introduced at the opening of the gospel of Luke, when Jesus, rejected in Nazareth, recalls that the prophets were rejected by Israel and accepted by Gentiles; at the end of the gospel he commands his disciples to preach his message to all nations, "beginning from Jerusalem." He repeats the command in Acts, telling them to preach "in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the Earth." They then proceed to do so, in the order outlined: first Jerusalem, then Judea, then Samaria, then the entire (Roman) world.

For Luke, the Holy Spirit is the driving force behind the spread of the Christian message, and he places more emphasis on it than do any of the other evangelists. The Spirit is "poured out" at <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a>, on the first Samaritan and Gentile believers, and on disciples who had been baptised only by <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, each time as a sign of God's approval. The Holy Spirit represents God's power (At his ascension, Jesus tells his followers, "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you"): through it the disciples are given speech to convert thousands in Jerusalem, forming the first church (the term is used for the first time in Acts 5).

As the second part of the two-part work Luke–Acts, Acts has significant links to the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>. Major turning points in the structure of Acts, for example, find parallels in Luke: the presentation of the child Jesus in the Temple parallels the opening of Acts in the Temple, Jesus's forty days of testing in the wilderness prior to his mission parallel the forty days prior to his Ascension in Acts, the mission of Jesus in Samaria and the Decapolis (the lands of the Samaritans and Gentiles) parallels the missions of the Apostles in Samaria and the Gentile lands, and so on (see <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>). These parallels continue through both books.

There are also differences between Luke and Acts, amounting at times to outright contradiction. For example, the gospel seems to place the <a href="Ascension%20of%20Jesus">Ascension</a> on <a href="Easter%20Sunday">Easter Sunday</a>, immediately after the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Christ">Resurrection</a>, while Acts 1 puts it forty days later. There are similar conflicts over the theology. While not seriously questioning the single authorship of Luke–Acts, these differences do suggest the need for caution in seeking too much consistency in books written in essence as popular literature.

Acts agrees with Paul's letters on the major outline of Paul's career: as Saul he is converted and becomes Paul the Christian missionary and apostle, establishing new churches in Asia Minor and the Aegean and struggling to free Gentile Christians from the <a href="Jewish%20Law">Jewish Law</a>. There are also agreements on many incidents, such as Paul's escape from Damascus, where he is lowered down the walls in a basket. But details of these same incidents are frequently contradictory: for example, according to Paul it was a pagan king who was trying to arrest him in Damascus, but according to Luke it was, characteristically, the Jews (2 Corinthians 11:33 and Acts 9:24). Many of the disagreements are not so immediately obvious: Acts speaks of "Christians" and "disciples", but Paul never uses either term, and there are striking differences in the accounts of Paul's relationship with the Jerusalem church and its leaders (Acts 9–15 vs. Galatians 1–2). Acts omits much from the letters, notably Paul's problems with his congregations (internal difficulties are said to be the fault of the Jews instead), and his apparent final rejection by the church leaders in Jerusalem (Acts has Paul and Barnabas deliver an offering that is accepted, a trip that has no mention in the letters). There are also major differences between Acts and Paul on <a href="Christology">Christology</a> (the understanding of Christ's nature), eschatology (understanding of the "last things"), and <a href="twelve%20apostles">apostleship</a>.

Assyria

Assyria was a major <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n kingdom and <a href="empire">empire</a> of the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a> and the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. It existed as a state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the <a href="Assur">Assur</a> city-state, until its lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the <a href="Early%20Bronze%20Age">Early</a> to <a href="Middle%20Bronze%20Age">Middle Bronze Age</a> through to the late <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>. From the end of the seventh century BC to the mid-seventh century AD, it survived as a <a href="geopolitical">geopolitical</a> entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although a number of <a href="Neo-Assyrian">Neo-Assyrian</a> states arose at different times during the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian</a> and early <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a>s between the mid-second century BC and late third century AD, a period which also saw Assyria become a major centre of <a href="Syriac%20Christianity">Syriac Christianity</a> and the birthplace of the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a>.

Centered on the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a> in <a href="Upper%20Mesopotamia">Upper Mesopotamia</a> (modern northern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, northeastern <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, southeastern <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and the northwestern fringes of <a href="Iran">Iran</a>), the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times. Making up a substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian "<a href="cradle%20of%20civilization">cradle of civilization</a>", which included <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>, the <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadian Empire</a>, and <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements for its time. At its peak, the Assyrian empire stretched from <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and the <a href="East%20Mediterranean">East Mediterranean</a> to <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and from what is now <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, to the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and eastern <a href="Libya">Libya</a>.

Assyria is named after its original capital, the ancient city of <a href="Assur">Aššur</a>, which dates to c. 2600 BC, originally one of a number of Akkadian city states in Mesopotamia. In the 25th and 24th centuries BC, Assyrian kings were <a href="pastoral%20society">pastoral</a> leaders. From the late 24th century BC, the Assyrians became subject to <a href="Sargon%20of%20Akkad">Sargon of Akkad</a>, who united all the <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian-</a> and <a href="Sumerian%20language">Sumerian-speaking</a> peoples of Mesopotamia under the <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadian Empire</a>, which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC. After its fall from power, the greater remaining part of Assyria was a geopolitical region and <a href="province">province</a> of other empires, although between the mid-2nd century BC and late 3rd century AD a patchwork of small independent Assyrian kingdoms arose in the form of <a href="Ashur">Ashur</a>, <a href="Adiabene">Adiabene</a>, <a href="Osroene">Osroene</a>, <a href="Beth%20Nuhadra">Beth Nuhadra</a>, <a href="Beth%20Garmai">Beth Garmai</a> and <a href="Hatra">Hatra</a>.

The region of Assyria fell under the successive control of the <a href="Median%20Empire">Median Empire</a>, the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, the <a href="Macedonian%20Empire">Macedonian Empire</a>, the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>, the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, and the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a>. The <a href="Arab">Arab</a> <a href="Islamic%20Conquest">Islamic Conquest</a> in the mid-seventh century finally dissolved Assyria (<a href="Assuristan">Assuristan</a>) as a single entity, after which the remnants of the <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian people</a> (by now <a href="Christians">Christians</a>) gradually became an ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious minority in the <a href="Assyrian%20homeland">Assyrian homeland</a>, surviving there to this day as an <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> people of the region.

Assyria was also sometimes known as <a href="Subartu">Subartu</a> and "Azuhinum" prior to the rise of the <a href="city-state">city-state</a> of Ashur, after which it was <a href="A%C5%A1%C5%A1%C5%ABr%C4%81yu">Aššūrāyu</a>, and after its fall, from 605 BC through to the late seventh century AD variously as <a href="Achaemenid%20Assyria">Achaemenid Assyria</a>, and also referenced as Atouria, <a href="Ator">Ator</a>, <a href="Hathor">Athor</a>, and sometimes as "Syria" which etymologically derives from Assyria according to <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, "Syria" (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>), "Assyria" (<a href="Latin">Latin</a>) and <a href="As%C5%8Drist%C4%81n">Asōristān</a> (Middle Persian). "Assyria" can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where Assyria, its empires and the <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian people</a> were (and still are) centered.

The <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> modern <a href="Eastern%20Aramaic%20languages">Eastern Aramaic-speaking</a> <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> Christian ethnic minority in northern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, north east <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, southeast <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and northwest <a href="Iran">Iran</a> are the descendants of the ancient Assyrians (see <a href="Assyrian%20continuity">Assyrian continuity</a>).

In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> culture such as has been found at the <a href="Shanidar%20Cave">Shanidar Cave</a>. The earliest <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> sites in Assyria were the <a href="Jarmo">Jarmo</a> culture c. 7100 BC and <a href="Tell%20Hassuna">Tell Hassuna</a>, the centre of the "Hassuna culture", c. 6000 BC.

The Akkadian-speaking people (the earliest historically-attested Semitic-speaking people) who would eventually found Assyria appear to have entered Mesopotamia at some point during the latter 4th millennium BC (c. 3500–3000 BC), eventually intermingling with the earlier Sumerian-speaking population, with Akkadian names appearing in written record from as early as the 29th century BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ians and the Akkadians throughout <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, which included widespread <a href="wikt%3Abilingualism">bilingualism</a>. The influence of <a href="Sumerian%20language">Sumerian</a> (a <a href="language%20isolate">language isolate</a>) on Akkadian, and vice versa, is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a "<a href="sprachbund">sprachbund</a>". Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere after the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), although Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD, as did use of the <a href="Akkadian%20cuneiform">Akkadian cuneiform</a>.

The cities of <a href="Assur">Assur</a>, <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a>, <a href="Gasur">Gasur</a> and <a href="Arbil">Arbela</a> together with a number of other towns and cities, existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC), although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states.

Greco-Roman classical writers such as <a href="Julius%20Africanus">Julius Africanus</a>, <a href="Marcus%20Velleius%20Paterculus">Marcus Velleius Paterculus</a> and <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> dated the founding of Assyria to various dates between 2284 BC and 2057 BC, listing the earliest king as <a href="Belus%20%28Assyrian%29">Belus</a> or <a href="Ninus">Ninus</a>.

According to the Biblical <a href="generations%20of%20Noah">generations of Noah</a>, which appears to have been largely compiled between the 7th and 5th centuries BC, the city of Aššur was allegedly founded by a biblical <a href="Ashur%20%28Bible%29">Ashur</a> the son of <a href="Shem">Shem</a>, who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god. However, the much older attested Assyrian tradition itself lists the first king of Assyria as the 25th century BC <a href="Tudiya">Tudiya</a>, and an early urbanised Assyrian king named <a href="Ushpia">Ushpia</a> (c. 2050 BC) as having dedicated the first temple to the god Ashur in the city in the mid-21st century BC. It is highly likely that the city was named in honour of its patron Assyrian god with the same name.

The city of <a href="Assur">Aššur</a>, together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC. However it is likely that they were initially Sumerian-dominated administrative centres. In the late 26th century BC, <a href="Eannatum">Eannatum</a> of <a href="Lagash">Lagash</a>, then the dominant <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions "smiting <a href="Subartu">Subartu</a>" (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in "c." the early 25th century BC, <a href="Lugal-Anne-Mundu">Lugal-Anne-Mundu</a> the king of the Sumerian state of <a href="Adab%20%28city%29">Adab</a> lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is known. In the <a href="Assyrian%20King%20List">Assyrian King List</a>, the earliest king recorded was <a href="Tudiya">Tudiya</a>. According to <a href="Georges%20Roux">Georges Roux</a> he would have lived in the mid 25th century BC, i.e. circa 2450 BC. In archaeological reports from <a href="Ebla">Ebla</a>, it appeared that Tudiya's activities were confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a "<a href="Karum%20%28trade%20post%29">karum</a>" (trading colony) in Eblaite territory, with "king" Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the <a href="vizier">vizier</a> of Ebla for king Ishar-Damu).

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by <a href="Adamu">Adamu</a>, the first known reference to the Semitic name "Adam" and then a further thirteen rulers (<a href="Yangi">Yangi</a>, <a href="Suhlamu">Suhlamu</a>, <a href="Harharu">Harharu</a>, <a href="Mandaru">Mandaru</a>, <a href="Imsu">Imsu</a>, <a href="Harsu">Harsu</a>, <a href="Didanu">Didanu</a>, <a href="Hanu">Hanu</a>, <a href="Zuabu">Zuabu</a>, <a href="Nuabu">Nuabu</a>, <a href="Abazu%20%28Assyrian%20king%29">Abazu</a>, <a href="Belus%20%28Assyrian%29">Belus</a> and <a href="Azarah">Azarah</a>). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of <a href="Hammurabi">Hammurabi</a>, the <a href="Amorite">Amorite</a> king of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as "kings who lived in tents", were independent semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers. These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the "city state" of <a href="Ashur">Ashur</a> in the mid 21st century BC.

During the <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadian Empire</a> (2334–2154 BC), the Assyrians, like all the Mesopotamians (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of <a href="Akkad%20%28city%29">Akkad</a>, centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by <a href="Sargon%20the%20Great">Sargon the Great</a> claimed to encompass the surrounding "four quarters". The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia, had also been known as <a href="Subartu">Subartu</a> by the Sumerians, and the name Azuhinum in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper. The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) population. 

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the <a href="Nuzi%23Archaeology">Nuzi tablets</a>. During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, ancient Iran, Elam, the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, Canaan and Syria.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian "<a href="Karum%20%28trade%20post%29">karums</a>" in <a href="Hittite%20empire">Hatti</a> was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BC). On those tablets, Assyrian traders in <a href="Burushanda">Burushanda</a> implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name "Hatti" itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, <a href="Naram-Sin%20of%20Akkad">Naram-Sin</a>, campaigning in <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>.

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a> script to Asia Minor and <a href="The%20Levant">The Levant</a> (modern <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>). However, towards the end of the reign of <a href="Sargon%20the%20Great">Sargon the Great</a>, the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; "the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously".

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian <a href="Gutian%20people">Gutian people</a> in 2154 BC. The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BC and 2112 BC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the <a href="Neo-Sumerian%20Empire">Neo-Sumerian Empire</a> (or <a href="3rd%20dynasty%20of%20Ur">3rd dynasty of Ur</a>) founded in c. 2112 BC. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur, but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler ("shakkanakku") named Zāriqum (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to <a href="Amar-Sin">Amar-Sin</a> of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC (c. 2050 BC); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of "shakkanakka" or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.

The Old Assyrian Empire is one of four periods in which the history of Assyria is divided, the other three being: the <a href="Early%20Period%20%28Assyria%29">Early Assyrian Period</a>, the <a href="Middle%20Assyrian%20Empire">Middle Assyrian Period</a> and the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">New Assyrian Period</a>. Assyria was a major <a href="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> <a href="Afro-Asiatic%20language">Afro-Asiatic</a>-speaking kingdom and empire of the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a>. Centered on the <a href="Tigris-Euphrates%20River%20System">Tigris-Euphrates River System</a> in <a href="Upper%20Mesopotamia">Upper Mesopotamia</a>, the <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian people</a> came to rule powerful empires at several times. Making up a substantial part of the "<a href="Cradle%20of%20Civilization">Cradle of Civilization</a>", which included <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>, the <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadian Empire</a>, and <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements at its peak. 

At its peak, the Assyrian empire ruled over the what the <a href="ancient%20Mesopotamian%20religion">ancient Mesopotamian religion</a> referred to as the "<a href="Four%20Corners%20of%20the%20World">Four Corners of the World</a>": as far north as the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a> within the lands of what is today called the <a href="Republic%20of%20Armenia">Republic of Armenia</a> and the <a href="Republic%20of%20Azerbaijan">Republic of Azerbaijan</a>, as far east as the <a href="Zagros%20Mountains">Zagros Mountains</a> within the territory of present-day <a href="Islamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran">Islamic Republic of Iran</a>, as far south as the <a href="Arabian%20Desert">Arabian Desert</a> of today's <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</a>, as far west as the island of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, and even further to the west in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and eastern <a href="Libya">Libya</a>.

Assyria is named for its original capital, the ancient city of <a href="A%C5%A1%C5%A1ur">Aššur</a>, which dates to c. 2600 BC, originally one of a number of Akkadian city states in Mesopotamia. Assyria was also sometimes known as Subartu and Azuhinum prior to the rise of the city-state of Aššūr, after which it was Aššūrāyu, and after its fall. 

<a href="Ushpia">Ushpia</a> (2050–2030 BC) appears to have been the first fully urbanised independent king of Assyria, and is traditionally held to have dedicated temples to the god <a href="Ashur">Ashur</a> in the city of the same name. He was followed by <a href="Sulili">Sulili</a>, <a href="Kikkiya">Kikkiya</a> and <a href="Akiya">Akiya</a>, of whom little is known aside from Kikkiya conducting various building works in Assur.

Assyria remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked and its Amorite rulers deposed by the <a href="Hittite%20Empire">Hittite Empire</a>, and subsequently fell to the <a href="Kassites">Kassites</a> in 1595 BC, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, <a href="Agum%20II">Agum II</a>, and <a href="Erishum%20III">Erishum III</a> (1598–1586 BC) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers. <a href="Shamshi-Adad%20II">Shamshi-Adad II</a> (1585–1580 BC), <a href="Ishme-Dagan%20II">Ishme-Dagan II</a> (1579–1562 BC) and <a href="Shamshi-Adad%20III">Shamshi-Adad III</a> (1562–1548 BC) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, <a href="Ashur-nirari%20I">Ashur-nirari I</a> (1547–1522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a> Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom.

The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic <a href="Mitannian">Mitannian</a>-<a href="Hurrian">Hurrian</a> domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Indo-European-speaking Mitannians are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a language isolate, i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.
<a href="Ashur-nadin-ahhe%20I">Ashur-nadin-ahhe I</a> (1450–1431 BC) was courted by the Egyptians, who were rivals of Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the Near East. <a href="Amenhotep%20II">Amenhotep II</a> sent the Assyrian king a tribute of gold to seal an alliance against the Hurri-Mitannian empire. It is likely that this alliance prompted <a href="Saushtatar">Saushtatar</a>, the emperor of Mitanni, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of Ashur, after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being deposed by Shaustatar and replaced by his own brother <a href="Enlil-nasir%20II">Enlil-nasir II</a> (1430–1425 BC) in 1430 BC, who was then made to pay tribute to the Mitanni. <a href="Ashur-nirari%20II">Ashur-nirari II</a> (1424–1418 BC) had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.
The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitannian influence appears to have been short lived.

They appear not to have been always willing or indeed able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.
<a href="Ashur-bel-nisheshu">Ashur-bel-nisheshu</a> (1417–1409 BC) seems to have been independent of Mitannian influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with <a href="Karaindash">Karaindash</a>, the Kassite king of Babylonia in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped its former highly sophisticated financial and economic systems during his reign.
<a href="Ashur-rim-nisheshu">Ashur-rim-nisheshu</a> (1408–1401 BC) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital.
<a href="Ashur-nadin-ahhe%20II">Ashur-nadin-ahhe II</a> (1400–1393 BC) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from Egypt, probably in an attempt to gain Assyrian military support against Egypt's Mitannian and Hittite rivals in the region. However, the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge Mitanni or the Hittites.

<a href="Eriba-Adad%20I">Eriba-Adad I</a> (1392–1366 BC), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire, and instead began to exert Assyrian influence on the Mitanni.

The Middle period (1365 BC–1056 BC) saw reigns of great kings, such as <a href="Ashur-uballit%20I">Ashur-uballit I</a>, <a href="Arik-den-ili">Arik-den-ili</a>, <a href="Tukulti-Ninurta%20I">Tukulti-Ninurta I</a> and <a href="Tiglath-Pileser%20I">Tiglath-Pileser I</a>. During this period, Assyria overthrew the empire of the <a href="Hurri">Hurri</a>-<a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a> and eclipsed the <a href="Hittite%20Empire">Hittite Empire</a>, <a href="Egyptian%20Empire">Egyptian Empire</a>, <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, <a href="Elam">Elam</a>, <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> and <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a> in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>.
By the reign of <a href="Eriba-Adad%20I">Eriba-Adad I</a> (1392–1366 BC) <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a> influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between <a href="Tushratta">Tushratta</a> and his brother <a href="Artatama%20II">Artatama II</a> and after this his son <a href="Shuttarna%20III">Shuttarna III</a>, who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. The Hittites, having failed to save Mitanni, allied with Babylon in an unsuccessful economic war against Assyria for many years. Assyria was now a large and powerful empire, and a major threat to Egyptian and Hittite interests in the region, and was perhaps the reason that these two powers, fearful of Assyrian might, made peace with one another.

Shalmaneser's son and successor, <a href="Tukulti-Ninurta%20I">Tukulti-Ninurta I</a> (1244–1207 BC), won a major victory against the Hittites and their king <a href="Tudhaliya%20IV">Tudhaliya IV</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nihriya">Battle of Nihriya</a> and took thousands of prisoners. He then conquered Babylonia, taking <a href="Kashtiliash%20IV">Kashtiliash IV</a> as a captive and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title "King of Sumer and Akkad" first used by Sargon of Akkad. Tukulti-Ninurta I thus became the first Akkadian speaking native Mesopotamian to rule the state of Babylonia, its founders having been foreign Amorites, succeeded by equally foreign Kassites. Tukulti-Ninurta petitioned the god <a href="Shamash">Shamash</a> before beginning his counter offensive. <a href="Kashtiliash%20IV">Kashtiliash IV</a> was captured, single-handed by Tukulti-Ninurta according to "his" account, who "trod with my feet upon his lordly neck as though it were a footstool" and deported him ignominiously in chains to Assyria. The victorious Assyrians demolished the walls of Babylon, massacred many of the inhabitants, pillaged and plundered his way across the city to the <a href="Esagila">Esagila</a> temple, where he made off with the statue of <a href="Marduk">Marduk</a>. 

Middle Assyrian texts recovered at ancient <a href="D%C5%ABr-Katlimmu">Dūr-Katlimmu</a>, include a letter from Tukulti-Ninurta to his "sukkal rabi'u", or grand vizier, Ashur-iddin advising him of the approach of his general Shulman-mushabshu escorting the captive Kashtiliash, his wife, and his retinue which incorporated a large number of women, on his way to exile after his defeat. In the process he defeated the <a href="Elamites">Elamites</a>, who had themselves coveted Babylon. He also wrote an epic poem documenting his wars against Babylon and Elam. He progressed further south into what is today <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a>, conquering the "pre-Arab" <a href="South%20Semitic">South Semitic</a> kingdoms of <a href="Dilmun">Dilmun</a> and <a href="Meluhha">Meluhha</a>. After a Babylonian revolt, he raided and plundered the temples in Babylon, regarded as an act of sacrilege. As relations with the priesthood in Ashur began deteriorating, Tukulti-Ninurta built a new capital city; <a href="Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta">Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta</a>.

The Aramaeans of northern and central Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the Tigris. The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of <a href="Pitru">Pitru</a> at the junction between the Euphrates and <a href="Sajur">Sajur</a>; thence he proceeded to conquer the Canaanite/Phoenician city-states of <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>, <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a>, <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>, <a href="Simyra">Simyra</a>, <a href="Berytus">Berytus</a> (<a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>), <a href="Aradus">Aradus</a> and finally <a href="Arvad">Arvad</a> where he embarked onto a ship to sail the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, on which he killed a "nahiru" or "sea-horse" (which <a href="A.%20Leo%20Oppenheim">A. Leo Oppenheim</a> translates as a <a href="narwhal">narwhal</a>) in the sea. He was passionately fond of hunting and was also a great builder. The general view is that the restoration of the temple of the gods <a href="Ashur%20%28god%29">Ashur</a> and <a href="Hadad">Hadad</a> at the Assyrian capital of Assur (Ashur) was one of his initiatives.

<a href="Ashur-bel-kala">Ashur-bel-kala</a> (1073–1056 BC) kept the vast empire together, campaigning successfully against <a href="Urartu">Urartu</a> and <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a> to the north and the Arameans to the west. He maintained friendly relations with <a href="Marduk-shapik-zeri">Marduk-shapik-zeri</a> of Babylon, however upon the death of that king, he invaded Babylonia and deposed the new ruler <a href="Kada%C5%A1man-Buria%C5%A1">Kadašman-Buriaš</a>, appointing <a href="Adad-apla-iddina">Adad-apla-iddina</a> as his vassal in Babylon. He built some of the earliest examples of both <a href="Zoological%20Gardens">Zoological Gardens</a> and <a href="Botanical%20Gardens">Botanical Gardens</a> in Ashur, collecting all manner of animals and plants from his empire, and receiving a collection of exotic animals as tributes from Egypt.

Late in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by Tukulti-Mer, a pretender to the throne of Assyria. Ashur-bel-kala eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of Arameans to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as Carchemish and the source of the <a href="Khabur%20%28Tigris%29">Khabur river</a>, but by the end of his reign many of the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the Mediterranean, previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Assyrian Empire.

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of <a href="Anshar">Ashur</a>, the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king <a href="Tukulti-Ninurta%20I">Tukulti-Ninurta I</a>.

The Middle Assyrian Period was marked by the long wars fought that helped build Assyria into a <a href="warrior%20society">warrior society</a>. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society. Assyria needed less artificial <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> than Babylonia, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>".

All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the "ilku"-service. A <a href="legal%20code">legal code</a> was produced during the 14th and 13th centuries which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to <a href="divorce">divorce</a> their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed <a href="adultery">adultery</a>, she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce.

The women of the king's <a href="harem">harem</a> and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as <a href="Strike%20%28attack%29">beatings</a>, <a href="mutilation">mutilation</a>, and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. <a href="Execution">Execution</a>s were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by <a href="forced%20labour">forced labour</a>. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture or duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.

In the Middle Assyrian Laws, <a href="sex%20crime">sex crime</a>s were punished identically whether they were <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a> or <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a>. An individual faced no punishment for penetrating a cult prostitute, someone of an equal <a href="social%20class">social class</a>, or someone whose <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s were not considered solidly masculine. Such sexual relations were even seen as good <a href="Luck">fortune</a>. However, homosexual relationships with royal attendants, between soldiers, or with those where a social better was <a href="Top%2C%20bottom%20and%20versatile">submissive or penetrated</a> were either treated as <a href="rape">rape</a> or seen as bad <a href="omens">omens</a>, and punishments applied. One historian notes that the laws would not be so detailed "if homosexual behavior were not a familiar aspect of daily life of early Mesopotamia."

Assyrians opposed <a href="abortion">killing unborn babies</a>. Middle Age-Law states that if a woman aborts her baby, she should be impaled and not buried. She must be convicted by a judge first. If the woman died in the process of aborting the baby, she again was impaled and not buried. If a man hit a woman who was pregnant, and caused a miscarriage, the striker’s wife would be punished the same way. The striker would also pay “life for life”. If the woman died because of the strike the man again would pay “life for life”.

The <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Collapse">Bronze Age Collapse</a> from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a <a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">dark age</a> for the entire <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>, <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> and <a href="Balkan">Balkan</a> regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Assyria and its empire were not unduly affected by these tumultuous events for some 150 years, perhaps the only ancient power that was not. However, upon the death of <a href="Ashur-bel-kala">Ashur-bel-kala</a> in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a "comparative" decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern Aramea, south eastern Asia Minor, central Mesopotamia and north western Iran.

New <a href="West%20Semitic%20languages">West Semitic-speaking</a> peoples such as the <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a>, <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>ns and <a href="Suteans">Suteans</a> moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of Babylonia to the south, Indo-European speaking <a href="Iranic">Iranic</a> peoples such as the <a href="Medes">Medes</a>, <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a>, <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a> and <a href="Parthians">Parthians</a> moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native <a href="Kassites">Kassites</a> and <a href="Gutians">Gutians</a> and pressuring <a href="Elam">Elam</a> and <a href="Mannea">Mannea</a> (all of which ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Ancient Iran), and to the north in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> the <a href="Phrygians">Phrygians</a> overran that part of the Hittites not already destroyed by Assyria, and <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a> emerged, a new <a href="Hurrian">Hurrian</a> state named <a href="Urartu">Urartu</a> arose in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, and <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a>, <a href="Colchians">Colchians</a> (Georgians) and <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> around the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> was divided and in disarray, and <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> were battling with other <a href="West%20Asia">West Asia</a>n peoples such as the <a href="Amalekites">Amalekites</a>, <a href="Moabites">Moabites</a>, <a href="Edomites">Edomites</a> and <a href="Ammonites">Ammonites</a> and the non-Semitic-speaking <a href="Peleset">Peleset</a>/<a href="Philistines">Philistines</a> (who have been conjectured to be one of the so-called <a href="Sea%20Peoples">Sea Peoples</a>) for the control of southern <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>. <a href="Dorian%20Greeks">Dorian Greeks</a> usurped the earlier <a href="Mycenaean%20Greeks">Mycenaean Greeks</a> in western Asia Minor, and the <a href="Sea%20Peoples">Sea Peoples</a> ravaged the <a href="Eastern%20Mediterranean">Eastern Mediterranean</a>.

Other new peoples, such as the <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a>, <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <a href="Nubians">Nubians</a> and <a href="Kushites">Kushites</a> were to emerge later, during the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Neo-Assyrian Empire</a>.
Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria in comparison to its former might, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world. Assyria, with its stable monarchy, powerful army and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia, Lydia and Media. Kings such as <a href="Ashur-bel-kala">Ashur-bel-kala</a>, <a href="Eriba-Adad%20II">Eriba-Adad II</a>, <a href="Ashur-rabi%20II">Ashur-rabi II</a>, <a href="Ashurnasirpal%20I">Ashurnasirpal I</a>, <a href="Tiglath-Pileser%20II">Tiglath-Pileser II</a> and <a href="Ashur-Dan%20II">Ashur-Dan II</a> successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time.

Assyrian kings during this period appear to have adopted a policy of maintaining and defending a compact, secure nation and satellite colonies immediately surrounding it, and interspersed this with sporadic punitive raids and invasions of neighbouring territories when the need arose.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of <a href="Adad-nirari%20II">Adad-nirari II</a>, in 911 BC, lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the <a href="Babylonians">Babylonians, Chaldeans</a>, <a href="Medes">Medes/Persians</a>, <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> and <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> in 612 BC.

Assyria maintained a large and thriving rural population, combined with a number of well fortified cities, Major Assyrian cities during this period included; <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a>, <a href="Assur">Assur</a>, <a href="Kalhu">Kalhu</a> (<a href="Calah">Calah</a>, <a href="Nimrud">Nimrud</a>), <a href="Arbil">Arbela</a> (<a href="Erbil">Erbil</a>), <a href="Arrapha">Arrapha</a> (<a href="Karka">Karka</a>, <a href="Kirkuk">Kirkuk</a>), <a href="Dur-Sharrukin">Dur-Sharrukin</a>, <a href="Imgur-Enlil">Imgur-Enlil</a>, <a href="Carchemish">Carchemish</a>, <a href="Harran">Harran</a>, <a href="Tushhan">Tushhan</a>, <a href="Til-Barsip">Til-Barsip</a>, <a href="Ekallatum">Ekallatum</a>, <a href="Kanesh">Kanesh</a>, <a href="Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta">Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta</a>, <a href="Urhai">Urhai</a> (<a href="Edessa">Edessa</a>), <a href="Guzana">Guzana</a>, <a href="Kahat">Kahat</a>, <a href="Amid">Amid</a> (<a href="Diyarbakir">Diyarbakir</a>), <a href="Mardin">Mérida</a> (<a href="Mardin">Mardin</a>, <a href="Tabitu">Tabitu</a>, <a href="Nuhadra">Nuhadra</a> (<a href="Dohuk">Dohuk</a>), <a href="Ivah">Ivah</a>, <a href="Sepharvaim">Sepharvaim</a>, <a href="Rachae">Rachae</a>, <a href="Purushanda">Purushanda</a>, <a href="Sabata%20%28city%29">Sabata</a>, <a href="Birtha%20%28Mesopotamia%29">Birtha</a> (<a href="Tikrit">Tikrit</a>), <a href="Tell%20Shemshara">Tell Shemshara</a>, <a href="Dur-Katlimmu">Dur-Katlimmu</a> and <a href="Shekhna">Shekhna</a>.

Assyria once more began to expand with the rise of <a href="Adad-nirari%20II">Adad-nirari II</a> in 911 BC. He cleared Aramean and other tribal peoples from Assyria's borders and began to expand in all directions into <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Iran">Ancient Iran</a>, <a href="Levant">Levant</a> and <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>. 

<a href="Ashurnasirpal%20II">Ashurnasirpal II</a> (883–859 BC) continued this expansion apace, subjugating much of the Levant to the west, the newly arrived <a href="Persians">Persians</a> and <a href="Medes">Medes</a> to the east, annexed central Mesopotamia from Babylon to the south, and expanded deep into <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> to the north. He moved the capital from <a href="Ashur">Ashur</a> to <a href="Kalhu">Kalhu</a> (<a href="Calah">Calah</a>/<a href="Nimrud">Nimrud</a>) and undertook impressive building works throughout Assyria. <a href="Shalmaneser%20III">Shalmaneser III</a> (859–824 BC) projected Assyrian power even further, conquering to the foothills of the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="Aram-Damascus">Aram-Damascus</a>, and subjugating <a href="Persia">Persia</a> and the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> who dwelt to the south of Mesopotamia, as well as driving the <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> from <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>. It was during the reign of Shalmaneser III that the <a href="Arab%20people">Arabs</a> and <a href="Chaldeans">Chaldeans</a> first enter the pages of recorded history.

Little further expansion took place under <a href="Shamshi-Adad%20V">Shamshi-Adad V</a> and his successor, the regent queen <a href="Semiramis">Semiramis</a>, however when <a href="Adad-nirari%20III">Adad-nirari III</a> came of age, he took the reins of power from mother and set about a relentless campaign of conquest; subjugated the Arameans, Phoenicians, Philistines, Israelites, Neo-Hittites and Edomites, Persians, Medes and Manneans, penetrating as far as the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. He invaded and subjugated <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, and then the migrant <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>n and <a href="Sutean">Sutean</a> tribes settled in south eastern Mesopotamia whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage.

Assyria then ceased to expand further for a time, until the reign of <a href="Tiglath-Pileser%20III">Tiglath-Pileser III</a>. He created the world's first <a href="Professional%20army">Professional army</a>, introduced <a href="Imperial%20Aramaic">Imperial Aramaic</a> as the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of Assyria and its vast empire, and reorganised the empire drastically. Tiglath-Pileser III conquered as far as the <a href="East%20Mediterranean">East Mediterranean</a>, bringing the <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>, <a href="Philistia">Philistia</a>, <a href="Samarra">Samarra</a> and the whole of <a href="Aramea">Aramea</a> under Assyrian control. Not satisfied with merely holding Babylonia in vassalage, Tiglath-Pileser deposed its king and had himself crowned king of Babylon. The imperial, economic, political, military and administrative reforms of Tiglath-Pileser III were to prove a blueprint for future empires, such as those of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians, Byzantines, Arabs and Turks.

<a href="Shalmaneser%20V">Shalmaneser V</a> reigned only briefly, but once more drove the Egyptians from southern Canaan, where they were fomenting revolt against Assyria. <a href="Sargon%20II">Sargon II</a> quickly took Samaria, effectively ending the northern <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28united%20monarchy%29">Kingdom of Israel</a> and carrying 27,000 people away into captivity into the Israelite diaspora. He was forced to fight a war to drive out the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> and <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> who had attempted to invade Assyria's vassal states of <a href="Persia">Persia</a> and <a href="Media%20%28region%29">Media</a>. The <a href="Neo-Hittite">Neo-Hittite</a> states of northern Syria were conquered, as well as <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a> and <a href="Commagene">Commagene</a>. King <a href="Midas">Midas</a> of <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>, fearful of Assyrian power, offered his hand in friendship. <a href="Elam">Elam</a> was defeated and <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> and <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a> reconquered. He made a new capital city named <a href="Dur%20Sharrukin">Dur Sharrukin</a>. He was succeeded by his son <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> who moved the capital to <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> and made the deported peoples work on improving Nineveh's system of irrigation canals. Nineveh was transformed into the largest city in the world at the time.

<a href="Esarhaddon">Esarhaddon</a> had Babylon rebuilt, he imposed a "vassal treaty" upon his Persian, Median and Parthian subjects, and he once more defeated the Scythes and Cimmerians. Tiring of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> interference in the Assyrian Empire, <a href="Esarhaddon">Esarhaddon</a> decided to conquer Egypt. In 671 BC he crossed the <a href="Sinai%20Desert">Sinai Desert</a>, invaded and took Egypt with surprising ease and speed. He drove its foreign <a href="Nubian%20people">Nubian</a>/<a href="Kushite">Kushite</a> and <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>n rulers out, destroying the <a href="Kushite%20Empire">Kushite Empire</a> in the process. Esarhaddon declared himself "king of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Kush</a>". Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how; "All Ethiopians (read Nubians/Kushites) I deported from Egypt, leaving not one left to do homage to me". He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf.
Under <a href="Ashurbanipal">Ashurbanipal</a> (669–627 BC), an unusually well educated king for his time who could speak, read and write in Sumerian, Akkadian and Aramaic, Assyrian domination spanned from the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a> (modern <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>) in the north to <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Libya">Libya</a> and <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a> in the south, and from the <a href="East%20Mediterranean">East Mediterranean</a>, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> in the west to <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="Cissia%20%28area%29">Cissia</a> and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> in the east.

Ultimately, Assyria conquered <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>, <a href="Elam">Elam</a>, <a href="Median%20Empire">Media</a>, <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="Urartu">Urartu</a> (<a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>), <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>, <a href="Aramea">Aramea</a>/<a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>, the <a href="Neo-Hittites">Neo-Hittite States</a>, the <a href="Hurrian">Hurrian lands</a>, <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a>, <a href="Gutium">Gutium</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Israel</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>, <a href="Samarra">Samarra</a>, <a href="Moab">Moab</a>, <a href="Edom">Edom</a>, <a href="Corduene">Corduene</a>, <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, <a href="Mannea">Mannea</a>, and <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, and defeated and/or exacted tribute from <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>, <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Cimmeria</a>, <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and others. At its height, the Empire encompassed the whole of the modern nations of <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="Palestinian%20territories">Palestine</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>, <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>, <a href="State%20of%20Palestine">Palestine</a> and <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, together with large swathes of <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>, <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>.

The Assyrian Empire was severely crippled following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC—the nation and its empire descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, <a href="Ashur-etil-ilani">Ashur-etil-ilani</a>, <a href="Sin-shumu-lishir">Sin-shumu-lishir</a> and <a href="Sin-shar-ishkun">Sin-shar-ishkun</a>. <a href="Twenty-sixth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Egypt's 26th Dynasty</a>, which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals, quietly detached itself from Assyria, although it was careful to retain friendly relations.

The <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> and <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid Assyrian colonies, with hordes of horse borne marauders ravaging parts of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> and the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus</a>, where the vassal kings of <a href="Urartu">Urartu</a> and <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a> begged their Assyrian overlord for help in vain. They also raided the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Israel</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> (where <a href="Ashkelon">Ashkelon</a> was sacked by the Scythians) and all the way into Egypt whose coasts were ravaged and looted with impunity.

The <a href="Iranic">Iranic</a> peoples (the <a href="Medes">Medes</a>, <a href="Persia">Persia</a>ns and <a href="Parthians">Parthians</a>), aided by the previous Assyrian destruction of the hitherto dominant <a href="Elamites">Elamites</a> of <a href="Ancient%20Iran">Ancient Iran</a>, also took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to coalesce into a powerful Median dominated force which destroyed the "pre-Iranic" Assyrian vassal kingdom of <a href="Mannea">Mannea</a> and absorbed the remnants of the pre-Iranic <a href="Elamites">Elamites</a> of southern Iran, and the equally pre-Iranic <a href="Gutians">Gutians</a>, <a href="Manneans">Manneans</a> and <a href="Kassites">Kassites</a> of the <a href="Zagros%20Mountains">Zagros Mountains</a> and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>.

<a href="Cyaxares">Cyaxares</a> (technically a vassal of Assyria), in an alliance with the Scythians and Cimmerians, launched a surprise attack on a civil war beleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking Kalhu (the Biblical Calah/Nimrud) and taking Arrapkha (modern Kirkuk) and <a href="Gasur">Gasur</a>. Nabopolassar, still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia by Assyrian forces, was completely uninvolved in this major breakthrough against Assyria.

Despite the sorely depleted state of Assyria, bitter fighting ensued; throughout 614 BC the alliance of powers continued to gradually make hard fought inroads into Assyria itself, however in 613 BC the Assyrians somehow rallied against the odds and scored a number of counterattacking victories over the Medes-Persians, Babylonians-Chaldeans and Scythians-Cimmerians. This led to the coalition of forces ranged against it to unite and launch a massive combined attack in 612 BC, finally besieging and entering Nineveh in late 612 BC, with Sin-shar-ishkun being slain in the bitter street by street fighting. Despite the loss of almost all of its major cities, and in the face of overwhelming odds, Assyrian resistance continued under <a href="Ashur-uballit%20II">Ashur-uballit II</a> (612–605 BC), who fought his way out of Nineveh and coalesced Assyrian forces around <a href="Harran">Harran</a> (in modern south east Turkey), <a href="Carchemish">Carchemish</a> (modern <a href="Jarablus">Jarablus</a> in north east Syria) and in the vassal kingdom of <a href="Urartu">Urartu</a> (in modern north eastern Turkey). However, the alliance of powers took Harran in 608 BC, and after a failed bid to recapture the city by the Assyrian king the same year, Carchemish too fell in 605 BC.

Sections of the Assyrian army retreated to the western corner of Assyria after the fall of Harran and Carchemish, and a number of Assyrian imperial records survive between 604 BC and 599 BC in and around the Assyrian city of <a href="Dur-Katlimmu">Dur-Katlimmu</a> in what is today north eastern Syria, and so it is possible that remnants of the Assyrian administration and army still continued to hold out in the region for a few years. Certainly by 599 BC at the very latest, Assyria had been destroyed as an independent political entity, although it was to launch major rebellions against the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> in 546 BC and 520 BC, and remained a <a href="geo-political">geo-political</a> region, ethnic entity and colonised province until the late 7th century AD, with small Assyrian states emerging in the region between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.

Assyria was initially ruled by the short lived <a href="Median%20Empire">Median Empire</a> (605–549 BC) after its fall. In a twist of fate, <a href="Nabonidus">Nabonidus</a> the last king of Babylon (together with his son and co-regent <a href="Belshazzar">Belshazzar</a>) was himself an Assyrian from <a href="Harran">Harran</a>. He had overthrown the short lived <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>n dynasty in Babylonia, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, being fully absorbed into the native population of Babylonia. However, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in the city of Harran, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> and <a href="Kalhu">Kalhu</a> remained in ruins with only small numbers of Assyrians living within them, conversely a number of towns and cities such as <a href="Arrapkha">Arrapkha</a>, <a href="Guzana">Guzana</a>, <a href="Nohadra">Nohadra</a> and <a href="Harran">Harran</a> remained intact, and <a href="Assur">Assur</a> and <a href="Arbil">Arbela</a> (<a href="Irbil">Irbil</a>) were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival. However, Assyria spent much of this short period in a degree of devastation following its fall.

After the Medes were overthrown by the <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a> as the dominant force in Ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> (as <a href="Athura">Athura</a>) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see <a href="Achaemenid%20Assyria">Achaemenid Assyria</a>). Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion centered around <a href="Tyareh">Tyareh</a> was eventually quashed by <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a>.

Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army. In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520–519 BC.

The Persians had spent centuries under Assyrian domination (their first ruler <a href="Achaemenes">Achaemenes</a> and his successors, having been vassals of Assyria), and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to <a href="Ashurbanipal">Ashurbanipal</a>, and <a href="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> was retained as the "lingua franca" of the empire for over two hundred years, and Greek writers such as <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> still referred to it as "the Assyrian language". <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins. Conversely the ancient city of <a href="Assur">Assur</a> once more became a rich and prosperous entity.

It was in 5th century BC Assyria that the <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac language</a> and <a href="Syriac%20script">Syriac script</a> evolved. Five centuries later these were later to have a global influence as the liturgical language and written script for <a href="Syriac%20Christianity">Syriac Christianity</a> and its accompanying <a href="Syriac%20literature">Syriac literature</a> which also emerged in Assyria before spreading throughout the Near East, Asia Minor, The Caucasus, Central Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and China.

In 332 BC, Assyria fell to <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, the <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonian</a> Emperor, who called the inhabitants "Assyrioi". The <a href="Macedonian%20Empire">Macedonian Empire</a> (332–312) was partitioned in 312 BC. It thereafter became part of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a> (312 BC). It is from this period that the later <a href="Name%20of%20Syria">"Syria" vs "Assyria" naming controversy arises</a>, the Seleucids applied the name 'Syria' which is a 9th-century BC <a href="Indo-Anatolian">Indo-Anatolian</a> derivation of 'Assyria' (see <a href="Etymology%20of%20Syria">Etymology of Syria</a>) not only to Assyria itself, but also to the Levantine lands to the west (historically known as <a href="Aram%20%28biblical%20region%29">Aram</a> and <a href="Eber%20Nari">Eber Nari</a>), which had been part of the Assyrian empire but, the north east corner aside, never a part of Assyria proper.

When the Seleucids lost control of Assyria proper, the name "Syria" survived but was erroneously applied not only to the land of Assyria itself, but also now to <a href="Aramea">Aramea</a> (also known as <a href="Eber%20Nari">Eber Nari</a>) to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, but apart from the north eastern corner, had never been a part of Assyria itself, nor inhabited by Assyrians. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Northern Mesopotamia and the Arameans and Phoenicians from the Levant being collectively dubbed "Syrians" (and later also "Syriacs") in <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greco-Roman</a> and later European culture, regardless of ethnicity, history or geography.

During Seleucid rule, Assyrians ceased to hold the senior military, economic and civil positions they had enjoyed under the Achaemenids, being largely replaced by Greeks. The Greek language also replaced Mesopotamian East Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, although this did not affect the Assyrian population themselves, who were not Hellenised during the Seleucid era.

During the Seleucid period in southern Mesopotamia, <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> was gradually abandoned in favour of a new city named <a href="Seleucia%20on%20the%20Tigris">Seleucia on the Tigris</a>, effectively bringing an end to "Babylonia" as a geo-political entity.

By 150 BC, Assyria was largely under the control of the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>. The Parthians seem to have exercised only loose control over Assyria, and between the mid 2nd century BC and 4th century AD a number of <a href="Neo-Assyrian">Neo-Assyrian</a> states arose; these included the ancient capital of <a href="Assur">Assur</a> itself, <a href="Adiabene">Adiabene</a> with its capital of <a href="Irbid">Arbela</a> (modern <a href="Irbil">Irbil</a>), <a href="Beth%20Nuhadra">Beth Nuhadra</a> with its capital of <a href="Nohadra">Nohadra</a> (modern <a href="Dohuk">Dohuk</a>), <a href="Osroene">Osroene</a>, with its capitals of <a href="Edessa">Edessa</a> and <a href="Amid">Amid</a> (modern <a href="Sanliurfa">Sanliurfa</a> and <a href="Diyarbakir">Diyarbakir</a>), <a href="Hatra">Hatra</a>, and "ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ" (<a href="Beth%20Garmai">Beth Garmai</a>) with its capital at <a href="Arrapha">Arrapha</a> (modern <a href="Kirkuk">Kirkuk</a>).

These freedoms were accompanied by a major Assyrian cultural revival, and temples to the Assyrian national gods <a href="Ashur">Ashur</a>, <a href="Sin">Sin</a>, <a href="Hadad">Hadad</a>, <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, <a href="Ninurta">Ninurta</a>, <a href="Tammuz%20%28deity%29">Tammuz</a> and <a href="Shamash">Shamash</a> were once more dedicated throughout Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia during this period.

In addition, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> arrived in Assyria soon after the death of Christ and the Assyrians began to gradually convert to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> from the <a href="ancient%20Mesopotamian%20religion">ancient Mesopotamian religion</a> during the period between the early first and third centuries. Assyria became an important centre of <a href="Syriac%20Christianity">Syriac Christianity</a> and <a href="Syriac%20Literature">Syriac Literature</a>, with the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a> evolving in Assyria, and the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a> partly also, with Osroene becoming the first independent <a href="Christian">Christian</a> state in history.

However, in 116, under <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a>, Assyria and its independent states were briefly taken over by Rome as the <a href="Assyria%20%28Roman%20province%29">province of Assyria</a>. The Assyrian kingdom of <a href="Adiabene">Adiabene</a> was destroyed as an independent state during this period. Roman rule lasted only a few years, and the Parthians once more regained control with the help of the Assyrians, who were incited to overthrow the Roman garrisons by the Parthian king. However, a number of Assyrians were conscripted into the <a href="Roman%20Army">Roman Army</a>, with many serving in the region of <a href="Hadrians%20Wall">Hadrians Wall</a> in <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a>, and inscriptions in Aramaic made by soldiers have been discovered in <a href="Northern%20England">Northern England</a> dating from the second century.

With loose Parthian rule restored, Assyria and its patchwork of states continued much as they had before the Roman interregnum, although Assyria and Mesopotamia as a whole became a front line between the Roman and Parthian empires. Other new religious movements also emerged in the form of <a href="gnosticism">gnostic sects</a> such as <a href="Mandeanism">Mandeanism</a>, as well as the now extinct <a href="Manichean">Manichean</a> religion.

In 226, Assyria was largely taken over by the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a>. After driving out the Romans and Parthians, the Sassanid rulers set about <a href="annexing">annexing</a> the independent states within Assyria during the mid- to late 3rd century, the last being Assur itself in the late 250's to early 260's. Christianity continued to spread, and many of the ethnically Assyrian churches that exist today are among the oldest in the world. For example, the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a> is purported to have been founded by <a href="St%20Peter">St Peter</a> himself in 67 AD.

Nevertheless, although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held onto their ancient <a href="Mesopotamian%20religion">Mesopotamian religion</a> until as late as the 10th or 11th century AD. The Assyrians lived in a province known as <a href="Asuristan">Asuristan</a>, and the region was on the frontier of the Byzantine and Sassanian empires.

The land was known as <a href="As%C5%8Drist%C4%81n">Asōristān</a> (the Sassanid Persian name meaning "Land of the Assyrians") during this period, and became the birthplace of the distinct <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a> (now split into the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Ancient Church of the East</a> and <a href="Chaldean%20Catholic%20Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>) and a centre of the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a>, with a flourishing <a href="Syriac%20Christians">Syriac</a> (<a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a>) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god <a href="Ashur">Ashur</a> (as well as other Mesopotamian gods) in his home city, in <a href="Harran">Harran</a> and elsewhere during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, indicating the ancient pre-Christian Assyrian identity was still extant to some degree.

During the Sasanian period, much of what had once been <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> in southern Mesopotamia was incorporated into Assyria, and in effect the whole of Mesopotamia came to be known as Asōristān. Parts of Assyria appear to have been semi independent as late as the latter part of the 4th century AD, with a king named <a href="Sennacherib%20II">Sennacherib II</a> reputedly ruling the northern reaches in 370s AD.

Centuries of constant warfare between the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> and <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a> left both empires exhausted, which made both of them open to loss in a war against the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> Arab army, under the newfound <a href="Rashidun%20Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate</a>. After the early Islamic conquests, Assyria was dissolved as an official administrative entity by an empire. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of further <a href="Arabisation">Arabisation</a> and the beginning of <a href="Islamification">Islamification</a>, and the region saw a large influx of "non indigenous" Arabs, <a href="Kurds">Kurds</a>, <a href="Iranian%20peoples">Iranian</a>, and <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic peoples</a>.

However, the indigenous <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> population of northern Mesopotamia retained their language, religion, culture and identity.

Under the Arab Islamic empires, the Christian Assyrians were classed as "<a href="dhimmis">dhimmis</a>", who had certain restrictions imposed upon them. Assyrians were thus excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, they did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters without a Muslim witness, they were subject to payment of a special tax (<a href="jizyah">jizyah</a>) and they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim-ruled lands. However, personal matters such as marriage and divorce were governed by the cultural laws of the Assyrians.

For those reasons, and even during the Sassanian period before Islamic rule, The <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> formed a church structure that spread <a href="East%20Syrian%20Rite">Nestorian Christianity</a> to as far away as China, in order to proselytize away from Muslim-ruled regions In Iran and their homeland in Mesopotamia, with evidence of their massive church structure being the <a href="Nestorian%20Stele">Nestorian Stele</a>, an artifact found in China which documented over 100 years of Christian history in China from 600 to 781 AD. Assyrian Christians maintained relations with fellow Christians in <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> throughout the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. In the 12th century AD, Assyrian priests interceded on behalf of persecuted Arab Muslims in Georgia. The Assyrian Church structure thrived during the period of 600–1300, and is regarded as a golden age for Assyrians.

The first signs of trouble for the Assyrians started in the 13th century, when the Mongols first <a href="Mongol%20Empire%23Middle%20East">invaded</a> the Near East after the <a href="Siege%20of%20Baghdad%20%281258%29">fall of Baghdad in 1258</a> to <a href="Hulagu%20Khan">Hulagu Khan</a>. Assyrians at first did very well under Mongol rule, as the <a href="Shamanist">Shamanist</a> Mongols were sympathetic to them, with Assyrian priests having traveled to Mongolia centuries before. The Mongols in fact spent most of their time oppressing Muslims and Jews, outlawing the practice of circumcision and , as they found them repulsive and violent. Therefore, as one of the only groups in the region looked at in a good light, Assyrians were given special privileges and powers, with Hülegü even appointing an <a href="Assyrian%20Christian">Assyrian Christian</a> governor to <a href="Erbil">Erbil</a> (<a href="Erbil">Arbela</a>), and allowing the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a> to build a church there.
However, the Mongol rulers in the Near East eventually converted to <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. Sustained persecutions of Christians throughout the entirety of the <a href="Ilkhanate">Ilkhanate</a> began in earnest in 1295 under the rule of <a href="O%C3%AFrat">Oïrat</a> amir <a href="Nawr%C5%ABz%20%28Mongol%20emir%29">Nauruz</a>, which affected the indigenous Assyrian Christians greatly. During the reign of the Ilkhan <a href="%C3%96ljeit%C3%BC">Öljeitü</a>, the Assyrian Christian inhabitants of Erbil seized control of the citadel and much of the city in rebellion against the Muslims. In spring 1310, the Mongol <a href="Malik">Malik</a> (governor) of the region attempted to seize it from them with the help of the <a href="Kurds">Kurds</a> and Arabs, but was defeated. After his defeat he decided to siege the city. The Assyrians held out for three months, but the citadel was at last taken by Ilkhanate troops and Arab, Turkic and Kurdish tribesmen on July 1, 1310. The defenders of the citadel fought to the last man, and many of the Assyrian inhabitants of the lower town were subsequently massacred.

Regardless of these hardships, the Assyrian people remained numerically dominant in the north of Mesopotamia as late as the 14th century AD, and the city of <a href="Assur">Assur</a> functioned as their religious and cultural capital. However, in the mid-14th century the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> Turk ruler <a href="Tamurlane">Tamurlane</a> conducted a religiously motivated massacre of the indigenous <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> <a href="Christians">Christians</a>, and worked tirelessly to destroy the vast Assyrian Church structure established throughout the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, destroying the entire structure of the church with the exception of the <a href="St%20Thomas%20Christians">St Thomas Christians</a> of the <a href="Malabar%20Coast">Malabar Coast</a> in <a href="India">India</a>, whom number 10 million or so in modern times. After Timurs campaign, The Assyrian Cultural and religious capital of <a href="Assur">Assur</a> was completely destroyed, thousands of Assyrians were massacred, the vast church structure of the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> was decimated, and the Assyrian population was from that point on reduced to a small minority living within Muslim dominated lands.

Around 100 years after the massacres by Timur, a religious schism known as the <a href="Schism%20of%201552">Schism of 1552</a> occurred among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia, when a large number of followers of the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> in <a href="Diyarbakir">Amid</a> elected a rival <a href="Patriarch">Patriarch</a> named <a href="Shimun%20VIII%20Yohannan%20Sulaqa">Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa</a> after becoming dissatisfied with the leadership of the Assyrian Church, at this point based in <a href="Alqosh">Alqosh</a>. Due to a need for an ordination by a metropolitan bishop, Sulaqa went into communion with the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> after at first failing to gain acceptance within the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a>. Rome named this new church "<a href="Church%20of%20Assyria%20and%20Mosul">The Church of Assyria and Mosul</a>" and its first leader "Patriarch of the East Assyrians" in 1553 AD.

Soon after coming back Sulaqa was assassinated by supporters of the rival patriarch in Alqosh, but was able to form a new church structure and line of succession known as the Shimun Line prior to his death. This group of Assyrians eventually broke off ties with Rome, moved en masse to the <a href="Hakkari">Hakkari</a> Mountains, and returned to the Assyrian church they once adhered to prior to the Schism of 1552, while still operating independently from the original Assyrian Church structure based in Alqosh.

A decade or so before the Shimun line broke off ties with Rome, another faction within the Assyrian Church entered into communion with Rome known as the Josephite line, and upon the Shimun line leaving, inherited the now vacant "Church of Assyria and Mosul", which was renamed the "<a href="Chaldean%20Catholic%20Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>" by <a href="Holy%20See">The Vatican</a> in 1683. This is now believed to be due to an error by the Roman Catholic Church which already had a history of labelling eastern Christians (including <a href="Greek%20Cypriots">Cypriots</a>) as "Chaldeans", but due to that error, some of their followers became known as <a href="Chaldean%20Catholics">Chaldean Catholics</a> or <a href="Chaldo-Assyrians">Chaldo-Assyrians</a>, despite having absolutely no ethnic, historical, linguistic, cultural or geographic connections whatsoever to the by now long extinct Chaldean tribe of south east Mesopotamia. However, these appellations appear to have only emerged relatively recently, as in the late 19th century, <a href="Hormuzd%20Rassam">Hormuzd Rassam</a>, himself a member of the Chaldean Catholic Church, states that church members were using the ethnic term Assyrian and the theological term "Nestorian" to describe themselves.

Later on in the 1830s the original <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> structure in Alqosh combined with the Catholic one, creating the modern Chaldean Catholic Church structure, which is ironic considering that the only remaining ethnic Assyrian Church to practice the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> denomination was the first one to split from the Assyrian Church of the East back in 1552. There was also another Nestorian Denomination known as the <a href="Ancient%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Ancient Church of the East</a>, which split from the Assyrian Church of the East due to reforms passed under the rule of <a href="Shimun%20XXIII%20Eshai">Shimun XXIII Eshai</a> in the 1960s, but with the election of <a href="Gewargis%20III">Gewargis III</a> in 2015 the churches had a reconciliation, and reunited.

In addition to the Eastern Rite Churches, The <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a> also has a large number of ethnically Assyrian Adherents, who are known sometimes as "Syriacs", the term 'Syriac' being etymologically derived from 'Assyrian'. The Syriac Orthodox Church has 5 million adherents across the globe, but is based in Damascus. However, since the 11th century it was based in the <a href="Saffron%20Monastery">Saffron Monastery</a> of <a href="Tur%20Abdin">Tur Abdin</a>, and prior to that it was based in <a href="Antakya">Antioch</a>. Like the Nestorian churches, schisms also occurred within the Syriac Orthodox Church. In 1626 <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> and <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin">Capuchin</a> missionaries began to proselytize among the Syriac Orthodox faithful at <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, forming a larger pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. So in 1662, when the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate had fallen vacant, the Catholic party was able to elect one of its own, <a href="Ignatius%20Andrew%20Akijan">Andrew Akijan</a> as Patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan’s death in 1677 two opposing patriarchs were elected, with one of those becoming the first Patriarch of the <a href="Syriac%20Catholic%20Church">Syriac Catholic Church</a>. This line of succession died out quickly, however, but in 1782 with the election of <a href="Ignatius%20Michael%20III%20Jarweh">Michael Jarweh</a> as Patriarch the "Ignatius" line has been the head of the Syriac Catholic Church since then, and also has its base in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>.

After these splits, the Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, such as the <a href="Massacres%20of%20Badr%20Khan">Massacres of Badr Khan</a> which resulted in the massacre of over 10,000 Assyrians in the 1840s, culminating in the large scale <a href="Hamidian%20massacres">Hamidian massacres</a> of unarmed men, women and children by <a href="Turkish%20people">Turks</a> and <a href="Kurds">Kurds</a> in the 1890s at the hands of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and its associated (largely <a href="Kurds">Kurdish</a> and <a href="Arab">Arab</a>) militias, which greatly reduced their numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey where over 25,000 Assyrians were murdered. The <a href="Adana%20massacre">Adana massacre</a> of 1909 largely aimed at Armenian Christians also accounted for the murder of some 1,500 Assyrians.

The Assyrians suffered a further catastrophic series of events during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in the form of the religiously and ethnically motivated <a href="Assyrian%20Genocide">Assyrian Genocide</a> at the hands of the <a href="Ottomans">Ottomans</a> and their <a href="Kurdish%20people">Kurdish</a> and Arab allies from 1915 to 1918. Some sources claim that the highest number of Assyrians killed during the period was 750,000, while a 1922 Assyrian assessment set it at 275,000. The Assyrian Genocide ran largely in conjunction with the similarly ethno-religiously motivated <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>, <a href="Greek%20Genocide">Greek Genocide</a> and <a href="Great%20Famine%20of%20Mount%20Lebanon">Great Famine of Mount Lebanon</a>.

In reaction against Ottoman cruelty, the Assyrians took up arms, and an <a href="Assyrian%20war%20of%20independence">Assyrian war of independence</a> was fought during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> which took place in what is today south eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, north western Iran and north eastern Syria. For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories against the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups. However, due to the collapse of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>—due to the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>—and the similar collapse of the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Turkish%20Armenia">Armenian Defense</a>, the Assyrians were left without allies. As a result, The Assyrians were vastly outnumbered, outgunned, surrounded, cut off, and without supplies. The only option they had was to flee the region into northwest Iran and fight their way, with around 50,000 civilians in tow, to <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> train lines going to <a href="Mandatory%20Iraq">Mandatory Iraq</a>. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I, and by 1924 many of those who remained were forcibly expelled in a display of <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> by the Turkish government, with many leaving and later founding villages in the <a href="Sapna%20valley">Sapna</a> and <a href="Nahla%20valley">Nahla valley</a>s in the <a href="Dohuk%20Governorate">Dohuk Governorate</a> of <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>.

In 1920 the Assyrian settlements in <a href="Mindan">Mindan</a> and <a href="Baquba">Baquba</a> were attacked by <a href="Iraqi%20Arabs">Iraqi Arabs</a>, but the Assyrian tribesmen displayed their military prowess by successfully defeating and driving off the Arab forces. The Assyrians also sided with the British during the <a href="Iraqi%20revolt%20against%20the%20British">Iraqi revolt against the British</a>.

The <a href="Assyrian%20Levies">Assyrian Levies</a> were founded by the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> in 1922, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as <a href="Rab-shakeh">Rab-shakeh</a>, Rab-talia and Turtanu, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs, Kurds and <a href="Iraqi%20Turkman">Turcoman</a>, guard the borders with Iran and Turkey, and protect British military installations. During the 1920s Assyrian levies saw action in effectively defeating Arab and Kurdish forces during anti-British rebellions in Iraq.

After Iraq was granted independence by the British in 1933, the Assyrians suffered the <a href="Simele%20Massacre">Simele Massacre</a>, where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. The massacres of civilians followed a clash between armed Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed <a href="Iraq%20Levies">Assyrian Levies</a> were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these civilians, and the British government then whitewashed the massacres at the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>.

Despite these betrayals, the Assyrians were allied with the British during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a>/<a href="Israel">Israel</a> and another four serving in <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and <a href="Albania">Albania</a>. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Habbaniya">Battle of Habbaniya</a> and elsewhere in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join World War II on the side of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1955, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time, after which they were disarmed and disbanded.

A further persecution of Assyrians took place in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in the late 1940s and early 1950s when thousands of Assyrians settled in Georgia, Armenia and southern Russia were forcibly deported from their homes in the dead of night by <a href="Stalin">Stalin</a> without warning or reason to <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, with most being relocated to <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, where a small minority still remain.

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 was a period of respite for the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria. The regime of Iraqi President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, a number of Assyrians moved south to cities such as <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Basra">Basra</a> and <a href="Nasiriyah">Nasiriyah</a> to enhance their economic prospects, others were well represented in politics, the military, the arts and entertainment, Assyrian towns, villages, farmsteads and Assyrian quarters in major cities flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel and be over-represented in sports such as boxing, football, athletics, wrestling and swimming.

However, in 1963, the <a href="Ba%27ath%20Party">Ba'ath Party</a> took power by force in Iraq, and came to power in Syria the same year. The Baathists, though secular, were <a href="Arab%20nationalism">Arab nationalists</a>, and set about attempting to <a href="Arabization">Arabize</a> the many non-Arab peoples of Iraq and Syria, including the Assyrians. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, together with an attempt to "Arabize" the ancient pre-Arab heritage of Mesopotamian civilisation.

The policies of the Baathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose nationalist governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to <a href="Turkification">Turkify</a> the Assyrians by calling them "Semitic Turks" and forcing them to adopt Turkish names and language. In Baathist Syria too, the Assyrian (and Syriac-Aramean) Christians faced pressure to identify as "Arab Christians". In Iran, Assyrians continued to enjoy cultural, religious and ethnic rights, but due to the <a href="Islamic%20Revolution">Islamic Revolution</a> of 1979 their community has been diminished.

In the aftermath of the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> of 2003, Assyrians became the targets of Islamist terrorist attacks and intimidation from both Sunni and Shia groups, as well as criminal kidnapping organisations; forcing many in southern and central Iraq to relocate to safer Assyrian regions in the north of the country or north east Syria.

In recent years, Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria have become the target of attacks amounting to <a href="genocide">genocide</a> by Islamist militants like <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIL</a> and <a href="Nusra%20Front">Nusra Front</a>. In 2014, ISIL attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the <a href="Assyrian%20homeland">Assyrian homeland</a>s of northern Iraq and north east Syria, and Assyrians forced from their homes in cities such as Mosul had their houses and possessions stolen, both by ISIL and also by their own former Arab Muslim neighbours. Assyrian <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> and <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> monuments and archaeological sites, as well as numerous Assyrian churches and monasteries, have been systematically vandalised and destroyed by ISIL. These include the ruins of <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a>, <a href="Kalhu">Kalhu</a> (<a href="Nimrud">Nimrud</a>, <a href="Assur">Assur</a>, <a href="Dur-Sharrukin">Dur-Sharrukin</a> and <a href="Hatra">Hatra</a>). ISIL destroyed a 3,000 year-old Ziggurat. ISIL destroyed Virgin Mary Church, in 2015 St. Markourkas Church was destroyed and the cemetery was bulldozed.

Assyrians in both Iraq and Syria have responded by forming armed Assyrian militias to defend their territories, and despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned have had success in driving ISIL from Assyrian towns and villages, and defending others from attack. Armed Assyrian militias have also fought ISIL alongside armed groups of Kurds, Turcoman, Yezidis, Syriac-Aramean Christians, Shabaks, Armenian Christians, Kawilya, Mandeans, Circassians and Shia Muslim Arabs and Iranians. “Dewkh Nawsha”, translates to “the ones who sacrifiace”. The group was formed days after ISIL took over Mosul. The militia is made up of volunteers, who come from all over the Nineveh plain. Dewkh Nawsha is supported by Assyrian Patriotic Party and are led by Wilson Khammu It is estimated that nearly 60 percent of Iraqi Assyrians have fled. Assyrians who have fled have ended up all over the world. 2009 U.S Census Bureau survey, reported that roughly 100,000 have relocated to the United States.

Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century. Assyrian identity; personal, family and tribal names; and both the spoken and written evolution of <a href="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> (which still contains many <a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a> loan words and an Akkadian grammatical structure) have survived among the Assyrian people from ancient times to this day. An <a href="Assyrian%20calendar">Assyrian calendar</a> has been revived.

Assyrian was a dialect of Akkadian language, a member of the <a href="East%20Semitic%20languages">eastern branch</a> of the <a href="Semitic%20language">Semitic</a> family and the oldest historically attested of the Semitic languages, which began to appear in written form in the 29th century BC. The first inscriptions in Assyria proper, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period. The ancient Assyrians also used Sumerian in their literature and liturgy, although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and Akkadian-speakers, which included widespread <a href="bilingualism">bilingualism</a>. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a "<a href="sprachbund">sprachbund</a>". Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In the Neo-Assyrian period, the <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic language</a> became increasingly common, more so than Akkadian—this was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings, in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians, and due to the fact that <a href="Tiglath-pileser%20II">Tiglath-pileser II</a> made it the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of Assyria and its empire in the 8th century BC.

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used distinct Akkadian influenced <a href="Eastern%20Aramaic%20languages">Eastern Aramaic varieties</a> and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. The <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac language</a> also emerged in Assyria during the 5th century BC, and during the Christian era, <a href="Syriac%20literature">Syriac literature</a> and <a href="Syriac%20script">Syriac script</a> were to become hugely influential.

However, the descendant Akkadian influenced Eastern Aramaic dialects from the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal, tribal, family and place names, still survive to this day among <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian people</a> in the regions of northern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, southeast <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, northwest <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and northeast <a href="Syria">Syria</a> that constituted old Assyria, and are spoken fluently by up to 1,000,000 Assyrians, with a further number having lesser and varying degrees of fluency. These dialects which contain many Akkadian loan words and grammatical features are very different from the now almost extinct <a href="Western%20Aramaic">Western Aramaic</a> of the <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a> in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> and <a href="Transjordan%20%28region%29">Trans-Jordan</a>, which does not have any Akkadian grammatical structure or loan words.

After 90 years of effort, the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> in 2011 completed an Assyrian <a href="dictionary">dictionary</a>, the style of which is more like an <a href="encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> than a dictionary.

The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed <a href="ancient%20Mesopotamian%20religion">ancient Mesopotamian religion</a>, with their national god <a href="Ashur%20%28god%29">Ashur</a> having the most importance to them during the Assyrian Empire. This religion gradually declined with the advent of <a href="Syriac%20Christianity">Syriac Christianity</a> between the first and tenth centuries.

The major deities worshipped in Assyria include;


The original pagan religion of the Assyrians was widely adhered to until around the 4th century, and survived in pockets until at least the 10th century. However, Assyrians today are exclusively <a href="Christian">Christian</a>, with most following the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a>, <a href="Chaldean%20Catholic%20Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Ancient Church of the East</a>, <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a>, <a href="Syriac%20Catholic%20Church">Syriac Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Assyrian%20Pentecostal%20Church">Assyrian Pentecostal Church</a> and <a href="Assyrian%20Evangelical%20Church">Assyrian Evangelical Church</a>. Assyrians had begun to adopt <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> (as well as for a time <a href="Manicheanism">Manicheanism</a> and <a href="gnosticism">gnosticism</a>) between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.

The Assyrian people originally adhered to one of two Churches- The <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a>, an <a href="East%20Syrian%20Rite">East Syrian Rite</a> Church, or the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a>, a <a href="West%20Syrian%20Rite">West Syrian Rite</a> Church. However, now there are nearly 20 different Assyrian Christian Churches including the ones followed by ethnically <a href="Malayali">Malayali</a> Converts in <a href="India">India</a>, known as <a href="St%20Thomas%20Christians">St Thomas Christians</a> who are not regarded as Assyrians. The first new Church formed around 100 years after the massacres by Timur during the 14th century due to the <a href="Schism%20of%201552">Schism of 1552</a>, which occurred among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia when a large number of Nestorian (followers of the Assyrian Church of the East) Assyrians in <a href="Diyarbakir">Amid</a> elected a rival <a href="Patriarch">Patriarch</a> named <a href="Shimun%20VIII%20Yohannan%20Sulaqa">Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa</a> after becoming dissatisfied with the leadership of the Assyrian Church (at this point based in <a href="Alqosh">Alqosh</a>). Due to a need for an official ordination, Sulaqa went into communion with the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> after at first failing to gain acceptance within the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a>. Rome named this new church "The Church of Assyria and Mosul" and its first leader "Patriarch of the East Assyrians" in 1553 AD.

Soon after coming back Sulaqa was assassinated by supporters of the rival patriarch in Alqosh, but was able to form a new church structure and line of succession known as the Shimun Line prior to his death. This group of Assyrians eventually broke off ties with Rome, moved en masse to the Hakkari Mountains, and returned to the Nestorian faith they once adhered to prior to the Schism of 1552 (although the Shimun line still operated independently from the original Assyrian Church structure based in Alqosh).

A decade or so before the Shimun line broke off ties with Rome, another faction within the Assyrian Church entered into communion with Rome known as the Josephite line, and upon the Shimun line leaving, inherited the now vacant Church of Assyria and Mosul, which was renamed the "<a href="Chaldean%20Catholic%20Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>" in 1683. This is now believed to be due to an error by the Catholic Church, but now due to that error their followers became known as <a href="Chaldean%20Catholics">Chaldean Catholics</a> or <a href="Chaldo-Assyrians">Chaldo-Assyrians</a> despite having no ethnic, historical, linguistic, cultural or geographic connections whatsoever to the by now long extinct Chaldean tribe of south east Mesopotamia.

Later on in the 1830s the original <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> structure in Alqosh combined with the Chaldean Catholic Jacobite one, creating the modern Chaldean Catholic Church structure, which is ironic considering that the only remaining ethnic Assyrian Church to practice the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> denomination until this day is ruled by the Shimun line- the very first Church to split from the Assyrian Church of the East back in 1552. There was also another Nestorian Denomination known as the <a href="Ancient%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Ancient Church of the East</a>, which split from the Assyrian Church of the East due to reforms passed under the rule of <a href="Shimun%20XXIII%20Eshai">Shimun XXIII Eshai</a> in the 1960s, but with the election of <a href="Gewargis%20III">Gewargis III</a> in 2015 the churches had a reconciliation, and reunited.

The Syriac Orthodox Church also has a large number of ethnically Assyrian Adherents mainly in the historically Assyrian regions of north east Syria and south east Turkey, who are known as "<a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Christians%20%28Middle%20East%29">Syriacs</a>". The Syriac Orthodox Church has 5 million adherents across the globe, mostly in India, but is based in Damascus. However, since the 11th century it was based in the <a href="Saffron%20Monastery">Saffron Monastery</a> of <a href="Tur%20Abdin">Tur Abdin</a>, and prior to that it was based in <a href="Antakya">Antioch</a>. Like the Nestorian churches, schisms also occurred within the Syriac Orthodox Church.

In 1626 <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> and <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin">Capuchin</a> missionaries began to proselytize among the Syriac Orthodox faithful at <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, forming a larger pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. So in 1662, when the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate had fallen vacant, the Catholic party was able to elect one of its own, <a href="Ignatius%20Andrew%20Akijan">Andrew Akijan</a> as Patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan's death in 1677 two opposing patriarchs were elected, with one of those becoming the first Patriarch of the <a href="Syriac%20Catholic%20Church">Syriac Catholic Church</a>. This line of succession died out quickly, however, but in 1782 with the election of <a href="Ignatius%20Michael%20III%20Jarweh">Michael Jarweh</a> as Patriarch the "Ignatius" line has been the head of the Syriac Catholic Church since then, and also has its base in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>.

Some Assyrians converted to <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> during the 20th century as well, forming the <a href="Assyrian%20Pentecostal%20Church">Assyrian Pentecostal Church</a> and <a href="Assyrian%20Evangelical%20Church">Assyrian Evangelical Church</a> among others.

Therefore, by the end of all the schisms which occurred, the Assyrian people are now followers of the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a>, <a href="Chaldean%20Catholic%20Church">Chaldean Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Ancient Church of the East</a>, <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a>, <a href="Syriac%20Catholic%20Church">Syriac Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Assyrian%20Pentecostal%20Church">Assyrian Pentecostal Church</a> and <a href="Assyrian%20Evangelical%20Church">Assyrian Evangelical Church</a>- in addition to even more sub churches which are located in India that are adherent to the mother sees in the Middle East.

Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by Sumero-Akkadian styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour.

The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of <a href="ziggurat">ziggurat</a>, with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.

Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at <a href="Nimrud">Nimrud</a> (Kalhu) and <a href="Khorsabad">Khorsabad</a> (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at <a href="Balawat">Balawat</a> (<a href="Imgur-Enlil">Imgur-Enlil</a>).
Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull <a href="lamassu">lamassu</a> or <a href="shedu">shedu</a> that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in "The March of Archaeology" that lamassi were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Although works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the <a href="Nimrud%20lens">Nimrud lens</a>, a piece of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> unearthed by <a href="Austen%20Henry%20Layard">Austen Henry Layard</a> in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of <a href="Assyrian%20astronomy">Assyrian astronomy</a>. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers, siege engines etc.

<a href="Achaemenid%20Assyria">Achaemenid Assyria</a> (539–330 BC) retained a separate identity, official correspondence being in <a href="Imperial%20Aramaic">Imperial Aramaic</a>, and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under Seleucid rule, however, Aramaic gave way to <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the Arab period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a> and the Romans until coming under the rule of the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a> from 226–651, where it was known as <a href="As%C5%8Drist%C4%81n">Asōristān</a>.

A number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; <a href="Adiabene">Adiabene</a>, <a href="Hatra">Hatra</a> and <a href="Osroene">Osroene</a>.

<a href="Mesopotamia%20in%20Classical%20literature">Classical historiographers</a> and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's "<a href="Chronicon%20%28Jerome%29">Chronicon</a>" lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with <a href="Ninus">Ninus</a>, son of <a href="Belus%20%28Assyrian%29">Belus</a>, down to <a href="Sardanapalus">Sardanapalus</a>, the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to <a href="Arbaces">Arbaces</a> the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in the "<a href="Canon%20of%20Kings">Canon of Kings</a>", beginning with <a href="Nabonassar">Nabonassar</a>.

The Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct <a href="Eastern%20Christianity">Eastern Christianity</a>, with its accompanying <a href="Syriac%20literature">Syriac literature</a>, between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD; however, <a href="ancient%20Mesopotamian%20religion">ancient Mesopotamian religion</a> was still alive and well into the fourth century and pockets survived into the 10th century and possibly as late as the 17th century in <a href="Mardin">Mardin</a>. However, the religion is now dead, and the Assyrian people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.

The <a href="Assyriology%23History%20of%20the%20field">modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria</a> begins with excavations in <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> in 1845, which revealed the <a href="Library%20of%20Ashurbanipal">Library of Ashurbanipal</a>. Decipherment of the <a href="cuneiform%20script">cuneiform script</a> was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the <a href="Royal%20Asiatic%20Society%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland</a> was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. <a href="Assyriology">Assyriology</a> has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological rediscovery of ancient Assyria, <a href="Assyrian%20nationalism">Assyrian nationalism</a> became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian people</a>, who have come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.

Aphasia

Aphasia is an inability to comprehend and formulate language because of damage to specific <a href="brain">brain</a> regions. This damage is typically caused by a cerebral vascular accident (<a href="stroke">stroke</a>), or head trauma, however these are not the only possible causes. To be diagnosed with aphasia, a person's speech or language must be significantly impaired in one (or several) of the four communication modalities following acquired brain injury or have significant decline over a short time period (progressive aphasia). The four communication modalities are auditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading and writing, and functional communication.

The difficulties of people with aphasia can range from occasional trouble finding words to losing the ability to speak, read, or write; intelligence, however, is unaffected. Expressive language and receptive language can both be affected as well. Aphasia also affects <a href="visual%20language">visual language</a> such as <a href="sign%20language">sign language</a>. In contrast, the use of <a href="formulaic%20language">formulaic expressions</a> in everyday communication is often preserved. One prevalent deficit in the aphasias is <a href="Anomic%20aphasia">anomia</a>, which is a deficit in word finding ability.

The term "aphasia" implies that one or more communication modalities in the brain have been damaged and are therefore functioning incorrectly. Aphasia does not refer to damage to the brain that results in motor or sensory deficits, which produces <a href="dysarthria">abnormal speech</a>; that is, aphasia is not related to the mechanics of <a href="speech">speech</a> but rather the individual's language cognition (although a person can have both problems). An individual's "language" is the socially shared set of rules as well as the thought processes that go behind verbalized speech. It is not a result of a more peripheral motor or sensory difficulty, such as <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a> affecting the speech muscles or a general hearing impairment.

People with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as <a href="dysarthria">dysarthria</a> or <a href="apraxia">apraxia</a> and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain. Signs and symptoms may or may not be present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication. Often those with aphasia will try to hide their inability to name objects by using words like "thing". So when asked to name a pencil they may say it is a thing used to write.
Given the previously stated signs and symptoms the following behaviors are often seen in people with aphasia as a result of attempted compensation for incurred speech and language deficits:

The following table summarizes some major characteristics of different acute aphasias:


Aphasia is most often caused by stroke, but any disease or damage to the parts of the brain that control language can cause aphasia. Some of these can include brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, and progressive neurological disorders. In rare cases, aphasia may also result from <a href="herpesviral%20encephalitis">herpesviral encephalitis</a>. The <a href="herpes%20simplex%20virus">herpes simplex virus</a> affects the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical structures, and the hippocampal tissue, which can trigger aphasia. 
In acute disorders, such as head injury or stroke, aphasia usually develops quickly. When caused by brain tumor, <a href="infection">infection</a>, or <a href="dementia">dementia</a>, it develops more slowly.

There are two types of strokes: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke happens when a person’s artery, which supplies blood to different areas of the brain, becomes blocked with a blood clot. This type of stroke happens 80% of the time. The blood clot may form in the blood vessel, which is called a <a href="thrombus">thrombus</a>, or the blood clot can travel from somewhere else in the blood system that is called an <a href="embolus">embolus</a>. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or bursts. Overall, people experience bleeding inside or around brain tissue. This type of stroke happens 20% of the time and is very serious. The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are weak vessels, traumatic injury, chronic high blood pressure <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a>, and an <a href="aneurysm">aneurysm</a>.

Although all of the diseases listed above are potential causes, aphasia will generally only result when there is substantial damage to the <a href="left%20hemisphere">left hemisphere</a> (responsible for language function) of the brain, either the <a href="Cerebral%20cortex">cortex</a> (outer layer) and/or the underlying <a href="white%20matter">white matter</a>.

Substantial damage to tissue anywhere within the region shown in blue on the figure below can potentially result in aphasia. Aphasia can also sometimes be caused by damage to subcortical structures deep within the left hemisphere, including the <a href="thalamus">thalamus</a>, the <a href="Internal%20capsule">internal</a> and <a href="external%20capsule">external capsule</a>s, and the <a href="caudate%20nucleus">caudate nucleus</a> of the basal ganglia. The area and extent of brain damage or <a href="atrophy">atrophy</a> will determine the type of aphasia and its symptoms. A very small number of people can experience aphasia after damage to the <a href="right%20hemisphere">right hemisphere</a> only. It has been suggested that these individuals may have had an unusual brain organization prior to their illness or injury, with perhaps greater overall reliance on the right hemisphere for language skills than in the general population.

<a href="Primary%20progressive%20aphasia">Primary progressive aphasia</a> (PPA), while its name can be misleading, is actually a form of dementia that has some symptoms closely related to several forms of aphasia. It is characterized by a gradual loss in language functioning while other cognitive domains are mostly preserved, such as memory and personality. PPA usually initiates with sudden word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it.

Finally, certain chronic neurological disorders, such as <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a> or <a href="migraine">migraine</a>, can also include transient aphasia as a <a href="prodromal">prodromal</a> or episodic symptom. Aphasia is also listed as a rare side-effect of the <a href="fentanyl">fentanyl</a> patch, an opioid used to control chronic pain.

Aphasia is best thought of as a collection of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they might best be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time).

However, no such broad-based grouping has proven fully adequate. There is a huge variation among patients within the same broad grouping, and aphasias can be highly selective. For instance, patients with naming deficits (anomic aphasia) might show an inability only for naming buildings, or people, or colors.

It is important to note that there are typical difficulties with speech and language that come with normal aging as well. As we age language can become more difficult to process resulting in slowing of verbal comprehension, reading abilities and more likely word finding difficulties. With each of these though, unlike some aphasias, functionality within daily life remains intact.

Localizationist approaches aim to classify the aphasias according to their major presenting characteristics and the regions of the brain that most probably gave rise to them. Inspired by the early work of nineteenth century neurologists <a href="Paul%20Broca">Paul Broca</a> and <a href="Carl%20Wernicke">Carl Wernicke</a>, these approaches identify two major subtypes of aphasia and several more minor subtypes:


Recent classification schemes adopting this approach, such as the "Boston-Neoclassical Model", also group these classical aphasia subtypes into two larger classes: the nonfluent aphasias (which encompasses Broca's aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia) and the fluent aphasias (which encompasses Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia). These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: <a href="anomic%20aphasia">anomic aphasia</a>, which is characterized by a selective difficulty finding the names for things; and <a href="global%20aphasia">global aphasia</a>, where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.

Many localizationist approaches also recognize the existence of additional, more "pure" forms of language disorder that may affect only a single language skill. For example, in <a href="pure%20alexia">pure alexia</a>, a person may be able to write but not read, and in <a href="pure%20word%20deafness">pure word deafness</a>, they may be able to produce speech and to read, but not understand speech when it is spoken to them.

Although localizationist approaches provide a useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, one problem is that a sizeable number of individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another. Another problem is that the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability in the types of difficulties they experience.

Instead of categorizing every individual into a specific subtype, cognitive neuropsychological approaches aim to identify the key language skills or "modules" that are not functioning properly in each individual. A person could potentially have difficulty with just one module, or with a number of modules. This type of approach requires a framework or theory as to what skills/modules are needed to perform different kinds of language tasks. For example, the model of <a href="Max%20Coltheart">Max Coltheart</a> identifies a module that recognizes <a href="phonemes">phonemes</a> as they are spoken, which is essential for any task involving recognition of words. Similarly, there is a module that stores phonemes that the person is planning to produce in speech, and this module is critical for any task involving the production of long words or long strings of speech. Once a theoretical framework has been established, the functioning of each module can then be assessed using a specific test or set of tests. In the clinical setting, use of this model usually involves conducting a battery of assessments, each of which tests one or a number of these modules. Once a diagnosis is reached as to the skills/modules where the most significant impairment lies, therapy can proceed to treat these skills.

<a href="Primary%20progressive%20aphasia">Primary progressive aphasia</a> (PPA) is a focal dementia that can be associated with progressive illnesses or dementia, such as 
<a href="frontotemporal%20dementia">frontotemporal dementia</a> / <a href="Pick%27s%20disease">Pick Complex</a> <a href="Motor%20neuron%20disease">Motor neuron disease</a>, <a href="Progressive%20supranuclear%20palsy">Progressive supranuclear palsy</a>, and <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, which is the gradual process of progressively losing the ability to think. Gradual loss of language function occurs in the context of relatively well-preserved memory, visual processing, and personality until the advanced stages. Symptoms usually begin with word-finding problems (naming) and progress to impaired grammar (syntax) and comprehension (sentence processing and semantics).<American Speech-Language-Hearing Association> People suffering from PPA may have difficulties comprehending what others are saying. They can also have difficulty trying to find the right words to make a sentence. There are three classifications of Primary Progressive Aphasia : <a href="Progressive%20nonfluent%20aphasia">Progressive nonfluent aphasia</a> (PNFA), <a href="Semantic%20Dementia">Semantic Dementia</a> (SD), and <a href="Logopenic%20progressive%20aphasia">Logopenic progressive aphasia</a> (LPA)

<a href="Jargon%20aphasia">Progressive Jargon Aphasia</a> is a fluent or receptive aphasia in which the patient's <a href="Speech%20communication">speech</a> is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact <a href="syntax">syntax</a> and <a href="grammar">grammar</a>, but the patient has problems with the selection of <a href="noun">noun</a>s. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with <a href="sound">sound</a>s. As such, patients with jargon aphasia often use <a href="neologism">neologism</a>s, and may <a href="perseveration">perseverate</a> if they try to replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).

There have been many instances showing that there is a form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign language is, after all, a form of communication that has been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of communication. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans perceive, to be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows up in some patients, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.

Following are some precautions that should be taken to avoid aphasia, by decreasing the risk of stroke, the main cause of aphasia:

Most acute cases of aphasia recover some or most skills by working with a speech-language pathologist. Recovery and improvement can continue for years after the stroke. After the onset of Aphasia, there is approximately a six-month period of spontaneous recovery; during this time, the brain is attempting to recover and repair the damaged neurons. Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity. Recovery also depends on the patient's age, health, motivation, <a href="handedness">handedness</a>, and educational level.

There is no one treatment proven to be effective for all types of aphasias. The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is because of the nature of the disorder and the various ways it is presented, as explained in the above sections. Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual. Studies have shown that, although there is no consistency on treatment methodology in literature, there is a strong indication that treatment in general has positive outcomes. Therapy for aphasia ranges from increasing functional communication to improving speech accuracy, depending on the person's severity, needs and support of family and friends. Group therapy allows individuals to work on their pragmatic and communication skills with other individuals with aphasia, which are skills that may not often be addressed in individual one-on-one therapy sessions. It can also help increase confidence and social skills in a comfortable setting.

A multi-disciplinary team, including doctors (often a physician is involved, but more likely a clinical neuropsychologist will head the treatment team), physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, dietician, and social worker, work together in treating aphasia. For the most part, treatment relies heavily on repetition and aims to address language performance by working on task-specific skills. The primary goal is to help the individual and those closest to them adjust to changes and limitations in communication.

Treatment techniques mostly fall under two approaches:

Several treatment techniques include the following:

Semantic feature analysis (SFA) -a type of aphasia treatment that targets word-finding deficits. It is based on the theory that neural connections can strengthened by using using related words and phrases that are similar to the target word, to eventually activate the target word in the brain. SFA can be implemented in multiple forms such as verbally, written, using picture cards, etc. The SLP provides prompting questions to the individual with aphasia in order for the person to name the picture provided. Studies show that SFA is an effective intervention for improving confrontational naming.

<a href="Melodic%20Intonation%20Therapy">Melodic Intonation Therapy</a> is used to treat non-fluent aphasia and has proved to be effective in some cases. However, there is still no evidence from <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled trial</a>s confirming the efficacy of MIT in chronic aphasia. MIT is used to help people with aphasia vocalize themselves through speech song, which is then transferred as a spoken word. Good candidates for this therapy include left hemisphere stroke patients, non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's, good auditory comprehension, poor repetition and articulation, and good emotional stability and memory. It has been hypothesized that MIT is effective because prosody and singing both rely on areas of the right hemisphere; it may be these right-hemisphere areas that are recruited for natural speech production after intensive training. An alternative explanation is that the efficacy of MIT depends on neural circuits involved in the processing of rhythmicity and <a href="formulaic%20language">formulaic expressions</a> (examples taken from the MIT manual: “I am fine,” “how are you?” or “thank you”); while rhythmic features associated with melodic intonation may engage primarily left-hemisphere subcortical areas of the brain, the use of formulaic expressions is known to be supported by right-hemisphere cortical and bilateral subcortical neural networks.

More recently, computer technology has been incorporated into treatment options. A key indication for good prognosis is treatment intensity. A minimum of two–three hours per week has been specified to produce positive results. The main advantage of using computers is that it can greatly increase intensity of therapy. These programs consist of a large variety of exercises and can be done at home in addition to face-to-face treatment with a therapist. However, since aphasia presents differently among individuals, these programs must be dynamic and flexible in order to adapt to the variability in impairments. Another barrier is the capability of computer programs to imitate normal speech and keep up with the speed of regular conversation. Therefore, computer technology seems to be limited in a communicative setting, however is effective in producing improvements in communication training.

The intensity of aphasia therapy is determined by the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what “intense” aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. Overall, treatment is considered more intense when total therapy hours per week are increased, and on average, research suggests more intense therapy leads to better outcomes. For example, one study found that patients who were treated for 8.8 hours a week for 11.2 weeks progressed more than patients who were treated 2 hours a week for 22.9 weeks. Results of another study corroborate these findings. The researchers found that patients who received intensive therapy of 100 treatment hours over 62 weeks scored higher on language measures than the control group who received less intensive therapy. Therefore, although there is a general consensus that intense treatment encourages more improvement, there is not a straightforward definition of “intense” treatment.

Intensity of treatment should be individualized based on the recency of stroke, therapy goals, and other patient-specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation. Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity and is able to tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke. Some patients cannot tolerate therapy directly after a stroke due to confusion or exhaustion, but may tolerate therapy better later. Intensity of treatment after a stroke should be dependent on the patient’s motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy. Level of intensity also depends on therapy goals; for certain goals non-intensive therapy is more beneficial. For example, non-intensive therapy has been found to be more effective than intensive therapy when targeting naming accuracy in patients with anomia. This is because more time in between sessions allows for rehearsal and reinforces long term learning.

Intensity of therapy is also dependent on the recency of stroke. Patients react differently to intense treatment in the acute phase (0–3 months post stroke), sub-acute phase (3–6 months post stroke), or chronic phase (6+ months post stroke). Intensive therapy has been found to be effective for patients with nonfluent and fluent chronic aphasia, but less effective for patients with acute aphasia. Patients with sub-acute aphasia also respond well to intensive therapy of 100 hours over 62 weeks. This suggests patients in the sub-acute phase can improve greatly in language and functional communication measures with intensive therapy compared to regular therapy. Research suggests that intense treatment is most beneficial in the sub-acute or chronic phase, rather than directly post stroke. More research needs to be done to examine the optimal time for providing intense therapy to all aphasic patients.

Intensive therapy can be alternatively characterized by the magnitude of the demands placed on a client within a session. Under this definition, intensive therapy includes a few specific techniques such as Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy (CIAT) and Speech Intensive Rehabilitation Intervention (SP-I-R-IT). CIAT places high demands on the patient by restricting use of the strongest areas of the patient’s brain and requiring the weakest areas to work harder. Typical CIAT therapy sessions are intense and last for about 3 hours. One study found that when given intensive CIAT therapy, participant performance in verbal communication in everyday life significantly improved. Each participant in the study also showed improvement on at least one subtest within the Aachen Aphasia Test; which assesses language performance and comprehension in aphasia patients. These results suggest that intensive CIAT therapy is effective in patients with moderate, fluent aphasias in the chronic stage of recovery. SP-I-R-IT focuses heavily on speech production strategies and intervention. SPIRIT therapy has been found to be effective; patients participating in intensive SPIRIT therapy improved performance on standardized measures by 15% after 50 weeks of therapy.

Overall, intensity of aphasia treatment is an area that requires more research. Current research suggests that intense treatment is effective, although the definition of “intense” is variable. Most importantly, intensity of treatment should be determined on a case by case basis and should depend upon recency of stroke and the patient’s stamina, tolerance for therapy, motivation, overall health status, and treatment goals.

There are several outcomes that contribute to a patient's overall outcomes once diagnosed with aphasia including: neuroplasticity, age, overall health status, and patient motivation. <a href="Neuroplasticity">Neuroplasticity</a> is the brain's capability of change in response to the environment. Neuroplaticity underlies normal processes such as: typical development, learning & maintaining performance while aging, and the brain's response to a severe injury. Positive outcomes are most prominent when neuroplasticity is maximized for the aphasic patient, and is predicted by the patient's response to the other stated outcomes. The patient's age directly impacts the neuroplasticity the brain can allow, the younger the patient is, the greater plasticity is. Overall health status also greatly impacts outcomes in aphasic patients. If a patient has no underlying health problems, and is young, then they have better outcomes than someone who is older, has severe health issues (such as: obesity, heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, etc.) in conjunction with aphasia. However, the most important factor affecting the outcomes of a patient with aphasia is a patient's motivation. In order to be successful, regardless of the contributing outcomes, the patient must be highly motivated in order to make the most efficient outcomes. If the patient is not motivated to make positive outcomes in their life after being diagnosed with any type of aphasia, their prognosis to make great improvements is much less than someone who is highly motivated to make positive changes in their life. All of these outcomes contribute to success in Wernicke's, Broca's, Global, and Conduction aphasia, and are detailed below:

Wernicke’s Aphasia, considered a fluent aphasia, is often the result of trauma to the temporal region of the brain, specifically damage to Wernicke’s area. Trauma can be the result from an array of problems, however it is most commonly seen as a result of stroke Patients who have been diagnosed with Wernicke’s aphasia have fluent speech, but it is the meaning of their utterances that are most notably affected. While their sentence structure remains, the words patients use are often nonsensical

Comprehension is severely affected in patients with Wernicke’s aphasia. Wernicke’s area has been thought to be the center of language processing, specifically processing of meaning. While patients are still left with some comprehension, they are not able to repeat a sentence spoken to them or participate in an action requested by another speaker. A case study done by Ellis et al. discussed a patient who underwent several types of testing, one of which was a word-picture test. The conclusion of the test showed that while the patient understood what the image was, he had trouble retrieving the word and understanding the instructions. This case study suggests that it is language comprehension that is affected in Wernicke's aphasia and not a drop in intelligence.

Wernicke’s is considered a more severe form of aphasia, and is more commonly seen in older populations. Wernicke's area is in the left posterior temporal region of the brain, which is an important area for processing language comprehension. Wernicke’s aphasia has shown a high recovery rate and frequent evolution to other forms of aphasia. Though some cases of Wernicke’s aphasia have shown greater improvements than more mild forms of aphasia, people with Wernicke’s aphasia may not reach as high a level of speech abilities as those with mild forms of aphasia. Wernicke's aphasia is also referred to as receptive or fluent aphasia, due to the ability to speak grammatically and use appropriate prosody. However, much of what the person with aphasia says does not make sense, and oftentimes they will produce non-existent words and be unaware what they have said. People with Wernicke's aphasia have difficulties understanding the meaning of spoken words and sentences. Those with Wernicke's aphasia remain completely unaware of even their most profound language deficits.

(Broca’s and Anomic):

The term Anomic Aphasia usually refers to patients whose only prevalent symptom is impaired word retrieval in speech and writing. Typically, the spontaneous speech of a person with anomic aphasia is fluent and grammatically correct but contains many word retrieval failures. These failures lead to unusual pauses, talking around the intended word, or substituting a different word for the intended word. Anomic aphasia is the mildest form of aphasia, indicating a likely possibility for better recovery. Patients with Broca’s aphasia may also have difficulty with word retrieval, or anomia. In addition, patients with Broca’s aphasia comprehend spoken and written language better than they can speak or write. These patients self-monitor, are aware of their communicative impairments, and frequently try to repeat or attempt repairs. The preceding factors discussed correlate with a good prognosis for patients with Broca’s aphasia. Many patients with an acute onset of Broca’s aphasia eventually progress to milder forms of aphasia, such as conduction or anomic.

Therapy for Expressive Aphasia (nonfluent) is beneficial, even for patients with severe nonfluent aphasia. A study conducted by Marangolo and co-workers (2013) administered conversational therapy to patients with severe nonfluent aphasia. The results of the study demonstrated a significant increase in the patient’s expressive language. The authors suggested that an intensive conversational therapy program should be considered for patients with moderately severe nonfluent aphasia in order to enhance the patient's quality of life and improve their language expression. In addition, although Anomic Aphasia is seen to be less severe than other aphasias, therapy is still imperative to help decrease the patient’s word finding deficits. A research study conducted by Harnish and co-workers (2014), provided intense treatment to patients with anomic aphasia. Results of the study concluded significant increases in the participant’s expressive language. These results suggest that an intensive intervention program for patients with anomic aphasia provides a surprisingly quick expressive language increase. Specifically, these patients relearned to correctly produce the problematic words after one to three hours of speech-language therapy.

Global aphasia is considered a severe impairment in many language aspects since it impacts expressive and receptive language, reading, and writing. Despite these many deficits, there is evidence that has shown individuals benefited from speech language therapy. Even though each case is different, it has been noted that individuals with global aphasia had greater improvements during the second six months following the stroke when compared to the first 6 months. Intense and frequent speech-language therapy had been shown to be more effective, with the addition of daily homework. Improvement has also been shown when the individual was attentive, motivated, and information was presented in multiple ways.

In one study, 23 individuals that had previously received speech-language therapy, but had been dismissed because further recovery was not expected, participated in intense speech-language therapy. Results showed significant improvements in oral and written noun and sentence production, naming actions, and daily communication.

Even though individuals with global aphasia will not become competent speakers, listeners, writers, or readers, goals can be created to improve the individual’s quality of life. Collins (1991) suggests therapy targeting attainable goals that will have the greatest impact on an individual’s daily life, such as getting reliable yes/no answers or providing the patient gestures. Individuals with global aphasia usually respond well to treatment that includes personally relevant information, which is also important to consider for therapy.

Conduction and transcortical aphasias are caused by damage to the white matter tracts. These aphasias spare the cortex of the language centers, but instead create a disconnection between them.

Conduction aphasia is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus. The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract that connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Patients with conduction aphasia typically have good language comprehension, but poor speech repetition and mild difficulty with word retrieval and speech production. Patients with conduction aphasia are typically aware of their errors. The awareness of errors and the milder nature of conduction aphasia compared to other types contributes to a positive outcome. Additionally, a case study completed on a 54-year-old man with a large infarct in the arcuate fasciculus indicated that severe conduction aphasia can be successfully treated. Despite his global deficits, he made a full recovery after 30 months.

Transcortical aphasias include transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia, and mixed transcortical aphasia. Patients with transcortical motor aphasia typically have intact comprehension and awareness of their errors, but poor word finding and speech production. Patients with transcortical sensory and mixed transcortical aphasia have poor comprehension and unawareness of their errors. Despite poor comprehension and more severe deficits in some transcortical aphasias, small studies have indicated that full recovery is possible for all types of transcortical aphasia. Due to the limited research on outcomes for the specific subtypes of these aphasias, it is more important to focus on the other factors and severity of deficits in order to predict a reasonable outcome.

To better understand what aphasia is and how it affects both mental and physical aspects of speech, it is important to understand the history first. By knowing more about the history of this disorder, the better chance there is of ruling out potential misnomers of the disorder and possibly discovering new ways of thinking about treatment options. Although the cause for different types of aphasia's are mostly known, the best way to recover is still unknown. Many ancient cultures, such as the Egyptians, believed that the heart was where a person's soul was housed, therefore any issues of expression were caused by injury or tainting of the soul. The first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>, the <a href="Edwin%20Smith%20Papyrus">Edwin Smith Papyrus</a>, which details speech problems in a person with a <a href="traumatic%20brain%20injury">traumatic brain injury</a> to the <a href="temporal%20lobe">temporal lobe</a>. During the second half of the 19th century, aphasia was a major focus for scientists and philosophers who were working in the beginning stages of the field of psychology.

Aphasia was non-medically described in early texts, such as the Bible and writings of Homer, but there was no further mention of what aphasia was or how it occurred at that time. In medical research, speechlessness was described as an incorrect prognosis, and there was no assumption that underlying language complications existed. The earliest recorded medical cases of aphasia were made back in the Middle Ages, where it was thought to be an imbalance of bodily fluids in the brain that caused the inability to speak one's mind. The first medical documents dating back to the late 19th century contain early descriptions of aphasia. Broca and his colleagues were some of the first to write about aphasia, but Wernicke was the first credited to have written extensively about aphasia being a disorder that contained comprehension difficulties. Despite claims of who reported on aphasia first, it was F.J. Gall that gave the first full description of aphasia after studying wounds to the brain, as well as his observation of speech difficulties resulting from vascular lesions.

"Aphasia" is from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> <a href="Privative%20a">"a-"</a> ("without") + "phásis" ("φάσις", "speech").

The word "aphasia" comes from the word ἀφασία "aphasia", in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>, which means "speechlessness", derived from ἄφατος "aphatos", "speechless" from ἀ- "a-", "not, un" and φημί "phemi", "I speak".

Aorta

The aorta () is the main <a href="artery">artery</a> in the <a href="human%20body">human body</a>, originating from the <a href="Ventricle%20%28heart%29">left ventricle</a> of the <a href="heart">heart</a> and extending down to the <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a>, where it <a href="aortic%20bifurcation">splits</a> into two smaller arteries (the <a href="common%20iliac%20artery">common iliac arteries</a>). The aorta distributes <a href="Oxygen%20saturation%20%28medicine%29">oxygenated</a> blood to all parts of the body through the <a href="systemic%20circulation">systemic circulation</a>.

In anatomical sources, the aorta is usually divided into sections.

One way of classifying a part of the aorta is by anatomical compartment, where the <a href="thoracic%20aorta">thoracic aorta</a> (or thoracic portion of the aorta) runs from the <a href="heart">heart</a> to the <a href="thoracic%20diaphragm">diaphragm</a>. The aorta then continues downward as the <a href="abdominal%20aorta">abdominal aorta</a> (or abdominal portion of the aorta) diaphragm to the <a href="aortic%20bifurcation">aortic bifurcation</a>.

Another system divides the aorta with respect to its course and the direction of blood flow. In this system, the aorta starts as the <a href="ascending%20aorta">ascending aorta</a> then travels <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Superior%20and%20inferior">superiorly</a> from the heart and then makes a hairpin turn known as the <a href="aortic%20arch">aortic arch</a>. Following the aortic arch, the aorta then travels <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Superior%20and%20inferior">inferiorly</a> as the descending aorta. The descending aorta has two parts. The aorta begins to descend in the thoracic cavity, and consequently is known as the thoracic aorta. After the aorta passes through the <a href="Thoracic%20diaphragm">diaphragm</a>, it is known as the abdominal aorta. The aorta ends by dividing into two major blood vessels, the <a href="common%20iliac%20artery">common iliac arteries</a> and a smaller midline vessel, the <a href="median%20sacral%20artery">median sacral artery</a>.

The ascending aorta begins at the opening of the <a href="aortic%20valve">aortic valve</a> in the left ventricle of the heart. It runs through a common <a href="pericardium">pericardial sheath</a> with the <a href="pulmonary%20trunk">pulmonary trunk</a>. These two blood vessels twist around each other, causing the aorta to start out <a href="posterior%20%28anatomy%29">posterior</a> to the pulmonary trunk, but end by twisting to its right and <a href="anterior">anterior</a> side.
The transition from ascending aorta to aortic arch is at the pericardial reflection on the aorta.

At the root of the ascending aorta, the <a href="lumen%20%28anatomy%29">lumen</a> has three small pockets between the <a href="cusps%20of%20heart%20valves">cusps</a> of the <a href="aortic%20valve">aortic valve</a> and the wall of the aorta, which are called the <a href="aortic%20sinus">aortic sinus</a>es or the sinuses of Valsalva. The left aortic sinus contains the origin of the <a href="left%20coronary%20artery">left coronary artery</a> and the right aortic sinus likewise gives rise to the <a href="right%20coronary%20artery">right coronary artery</a>. Together, these two arteries supply the heart. The <a href="posterior%20%28anatomy%29">posterior</a> aortic sinus does not give rise to a coronary artery. For this reason the left, right and posterior aortic sinuses are also called left-coronary, right-coronary and non-coronary sinuses.

The <a href="aortic%20arch">aortic arch</a> loops over the left <a href="pulmonary%20artery">pulmonary artery</a> and the bifurcation of the <a href="pulmonary%20trunk">pulmonary trunk</a>, to which it remains connected by the <a href="ligamentum%20arteriosum">ligamentum arteriosum</a>, a remnant of the <a href="fetal%20circulation">fetal circulation</a> that is obliterated a few days after birth. In addition to these blood vessels, the aortic arch crosses the <a href="left%20main%20bronchus">left main bronchus</a>. Between the aortic arch and the pulmonary trunk is a network of autonomic nerve fibers, the <a href="cardiac%20plexus">cardiac plexus</a> or "aortic plexus". The left <a href="vagus%20nerve">vagus nerve</a>, which passes <a href="anterior">anterior</a> to the aortic arch, gives off a major branch, the <a href="recurrent%20laryngeal%20nerve">recurrent laryngeal nerve</a>, which loops under the aortic arch just lateral to the ligamentum arteriosum. It then runs back to the neck.

The aortic arch has three major branches: from <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">proximal</a> to <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">distal</a>, they are the <a href="brachiocephalic%20trunk">brachiocephalic trunk</a>, the <a href="common%20carotid%20artery">left common carotid artery</a>, and the left <a href="subclavian%20artery">subclavian artery</a>. The brachiocephalic trunk supplies the right side of the head and neck as well as the right arm and <a href="chest%20wall">chest wall</a>, while the latter two together supply the left side of the same regions.

The aortic arch ends and the descending aorta begins at the level of the <a href="intervertebral%20disc">intervertebral disc</a> between the fourth and fifth <a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">thoracic vertebrae</a>.

The thoracic descending aorta gives rise to the <a href="intercostal%20artery">intercostal</a> and <a href="subcostal%20artery">subcostal</a> arteries, as well as to the superior and inferior <a href="bronchial%20artery">left bronchial arteries</a> and variable branches to the <a href="esophagus">esophagus</a>, <a href="mediastinum">mediastinum</a>, and <a href="pericardium">pericardium</a>. Its lowest pair of branches are the superior phrenic arteries, which supply the diaphragm, and the subcostal arteries for the twelfth rib.

The abdominal aorta gives rise to <a href="lumbar%20arteries">lumbar</a> and musculophrenic arteries, <a href="renal%20artery">renal</a> and <a href="middle%20suprarenal%20artery">middle suprarenal arteries</a>, and visceral arteries (the <a href="celiac%20trunk">celiac trunk</a>, the <a href="superior%20mesenteric%20artery">superior mesenteric artery</a> and the <a href="inferior%20mesenteric%20artery">inferior mesenteric artery</a>). It ends in a bifurcation into the <a href="Common%20iliac%20artery">left and right common iliac arteries</a>. At the point of the bifurcation, there also springs a smaller branch, the <a href="median%20sacral%20artery">median sacral artery</a>.

The ascending aorta develops from the outflow tract which initially starts as a single tube connecting the heart with the <a href="aortic%20arches">aortic arches</a> (which will form the great arteries) in early development, but then is separated into the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. 

The <a href="aortic%20arches">aortic arches</a> start as five pairs of symmetrical arteries connecting the heart with the <a href="dorsal%20aorta">dorsal aorta</a>, and then undergo a significant remodelling to form the final asymmetrical structure of the <a href="great%20arteries">great arteries</a>, with the 3rd pair of arteries contributing to the <a href="Common%20carotid%20artery">common carotids</a>, the right 4th forming the base and middle part of the right <a href="subclavian%20artery">subclavian artery</a> and the left 4th being the central part of the <a href="aortic%20arch">aortic arch</a>. The smooth muscle of the great arteries and the population of cells that form the <a href="aorticopulmonary%20septum">aorticopulmonary septum</a> that separates the aorta and pulmonary artery is derived from <a href="cardiac%20neural%20crest">cardiac neural crest</a>. This contribution of the neural crest to the great artery smooth muscle is unusual as most smooth muscle is derived from mesoderm. In fact the smooth muscle within the abdominal aorta is derived from mesoderm, and the coronary arteries, which arise just above the <a href="Heart%20valve">semilunar valves</a>, possess smooth muscle of mesodermal origin. A failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to divide the great vessels results in <a href="persistent%20truncus%20arteriosus">persistent truncus arteriosus</a>.

The aorta is an <a href="elastic%20artery">elastic artery</a>, and as such is quite distensible. The aorta consists of a heterogeneous mixture of <a href="smooth%20muscle">smooth muscle</a>, nerves, intimal cells, endothelial cells, fibroblast-like cells, and a complex extracellular matrix. The vascular wall consists of several layers known as the <a href="tunica%20externa">tunica externa</a>, <a href="tunica%20media">tunica media</a>, and <a href="tunica%20intima">tunica intima</a>. The thickness of the aorta requires an extensive network of tiny blood vessels called <a href="vasa%20vasorum">vasa vasorum</a>, which feed the tunica externa and tunica media outer layers of the aorta. The aortic arch contains <a href="baroreceptor">baroreceptor</a>s and <a href="chemoreceptor">chemoreceptor</a>s that relay information concerning blood pressure and blood pH and carbon dioxide levels to the <a href="medulla%20oblongata">medulla oblongata</a> of the brain. This information is processed by the brain and the <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic nervous system</a> mediates the homeostatic responses.

Within the tunica media, smooth muscle and the extracellular matrix are quantitatively the largest components of the aortic vascular wall. The fundamental unit of the aorta is the elastic lamella, which consists of smooth muscle and elastic matrix. The medial layer of the aorta consist of concentric musculoelastic layers (the elastic lamella) in mammals. The smooth muscle component does not dramatically alter the diameter of the aorta but rather serves to increase the stiffness and viscoelasticity of the aortic wall when activated. The elastic matrix dominates the biomechanical properties of the aorta. The elastic matrix forms lamellae, consisting of <a href="elastic%20fiber">elastic fiber</a>s, <a href="collagen">collagen</a>s (predominately type III), <a href="proteoglycan">proteoglycan</a>s, and <a href="glycoaminoglycan">glycoaminoglycan</a>s.

Variations may occur in the location of the aorta, and the way in which arteries branch off the aorta. The aorta, normally on the left side of the body, may be found on the right in <a href="dextrocardia">dextrocardia</a>, in which the heart is found on the right, or <a href="situs%20inversus">situs inversus</a>, in which the location of all organs are flipped.

Variations in the branching of individual arteries may also occur. For example, the left <a href="vertebral%20artery">vertebral artery</a> may arise from the aorta, instead of the left <a href="common%20carotid%20artery">common carotid artery</a>.

In <a href="patent%20ductus%20arteriosus">patent ductus arteriosus</a>, a congenital disorder, the fetal <a href="ductus%20arteriosis">ductus arteriosis</a> fails to close, leaving an open vessel connecting the <a href="pulmonary%20artery">pulmonary artery</a> to the proximal <a href="descending%20aorta">descending aorta</a>.

The aorta supplies all of the systemic circulation, which means that the entire body, except for the <a href="human%20lung">respiratory zone of the lung</a>, receives its blood from the aorta. Broadly speaking, branches from the ascending aorta supply the heart; branches from the aortic arch supply the head, neck and arms; branches from the thoracic descending aorta supply the chest (excluding the heart and the respiratory zone of the lung); and branches from the abdominal aorta supply the <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a>. The pelvis and legs get their blood from the common iliac arteries.

The <a href="Pulsatile%20flow">pulsatile</a> nature of blood flow creates a pulse wave that is propagated down the <a href="arterial%20tree">arterial tree</a>, and at <a href="Aortic%20bifurcation">bifurcations</a> reflected waves rebound to return to semilunar valves and the origin of the aorta. These return waves create the <a href="Dicrotic%20notch%23Ventricular%20systole">dicrotic notch</a> displayed in the aortic pressure curve during the <a href="cardiac%20cycle">cardiac cycle</a> as these reflected waves push on the <a href="heart%20valve">aortic semilunar valve</a>. With age, the aorta stiffens such that the pulse wave is propagated faster and reflected waves return to the heart faster before the semilunar valve closes, which raises the blood pressure. The stiffness of the aorta is associated with a number of diseases and pathologies, and noninvasive measures of the pulse wave <a href="Aorta%23Blood%20flow%20and%20velocity">velocity</a> are an independent indicator of <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a>. Measuring the pulse wave velocity (invasively and non-invasively) is a means of determining <a href="arterial%20stiffness">arterial stiffness</a>. Maximum aortic velocity may be noted as V or less commonly as AoV.

<a href="Mean%20arterial%20pressure">Mean arterial pressure</a> (MAP) is highest in the aorta and the MAP decreases across the circulation from aorta to arteries to arterioles to capillaries to veins back to atrium. The difference between aortic and right atrial pressure accounts for blood flow in the circulation. When the left ventricle contracts to force blood into the aorta, the aorta expands. This stretching gives the potential energy that will help maintain blood pressure during <a href="diastole">diastole</a>, as during this time the aorta contracts passively. This <a href="Windkessel%20effect">Windkessel effect</a> of the great elastic arteries has important biomechanical implications. The elastic recoil helps conserve the energy from the pumping heart and smooth out the pulsatile nature created by the heart. Aortic pressure is highest at the aorta and becomes less pulsatile and lower pressure as blood vessels divide into arteries, arterioles, and capillaries such that flow is slow and smooth for gases and nutrient exchange.


All <a href="amniote">amniote</a>s have a broadly similar arrangement to that of humans, albeit with a number of individual variations. In <a href="fish">fish</a>, however, there are two separate vessels referred to as aortas. The ventral aorta carries de-oxygenated blood from the heart to the <a href="gill">gill</a>s; part of this vessel forms the ascending aorta in tetrapods (the remainder forms the <a href="pulmonary%20artery">pulmonary artery</a>). A second, dorsal aorta carries oxygenated blood from the gills to the rest of the body, and is <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> with the descending aorta of tetrapods. The two aortas are connected by a number of vessels, one passing through each of the gills.
<a href="Amphibian">Amphibian</a>s also retain the fifth connecting vessel, so that the aorta has two parallel arches.

The word 'Aorta' stems from the <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> "" from "aortē" (), from "aeirō", "I lift, raise" () This term was first applied by Aristotle when describing the aorta and describes accurately how it seems to be 'suspended' above the heart. 

The function of the aorta has been documented in the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>, where it is noted as one of three major vessels entering or leaving the heart, and where perforation is linked to death.

Abimelech (also spelled Abimelek or Avimelech; ) was the name of multiple <a href="Philistine">Philistine</a> <a href="monarch">kings</a> mentioned in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.

The name or title "Abimelech" is formed from Hebrew words for "father" and "king," and may be interpreted in a variety of ways, including "Father-King", "My father is king," or "Father of a king." In the Pentateuch, it is used as a title for kings in the land of Canaan.

At the time of the <a href="Amarna%20tablets">Amarna tablets</a> (mid-14th century BC), there was an Egyptian governor of <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> similarly named <a href="Abimilki">Abimilki</a>, who is sometimes speculated to be connected with one or more of the biblical Abimelechs.

Abimelech was most prominently the name of a polytheistic king of <a href="Gerar">Gerar</a> who is mentioned in two of the three <a href="wife-sister%20narratives%20in%20Genesis">wife-sister narratives in Genesis</a>, in connection with both <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a> (chap. 20) and <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a> (chap. 26).

Andrew "Tridge" Tridgell (born 28 February 1967) is an Australian <a href="computer%20programmer">computer programmer</a>. He is the author of and a contributor to the <a href="Samba%20%28software%29">Samba</a> <a href="file%20server">file server</a>, and co-inventor of the <a href="rsync">rsync</a> algorithm.

He has analysed complex <a href="proprietary%20protocol">proprietary protocol</a>s and algorithms, to allow compatible <a href="free%20and%20open%20source%20software">free and open source software</a> implementations.

Tridgell was a major developer of the Samba software, analyzing the <a href="Server%20Message%20Block">Server Message Block</a> protocol used for <a href="Workgroup%20%28computer%20networking%29">workgroup</a> and network file sharing by <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> products. He developed the <a href="talloc">talloc</a> hierarchical memory allocator, originally as part of Samba.

For his PhD dissertation, he co-developed <a href="rsync">rsync</a>, including the rsync algorithm, a highly efficient <a href="List%20of%20file%20transfer%20protocols">file transfer</a> and <a href="File%20synchronization">synchronisation</a> tool. He also was the original author of <a href="rzip">rzip</a>, which uses a similar algorithm to rsync. He developed spamsum, based on <a href="locality-sensitive%20hashing">locality-sensitive hashing</a> algorithms.

He is the author of <a href="KnightCap">KnightCap</a>, a <a href="reinforcement%20learning">reinforcement-learning</a> based <a href="chess%20engine">chess engine</a>.

Tridgell was also a leader in <a href="Hacker%20%28hobbyist%29">hacking</a> the <a href="TiVo">TiVo</a> to make it work in Australia, which uses the <a href="PAL">PAL</a> video format.

In April 2005, Tridgell tried to produce free software (now known as <a href="SourcePuller">SourcePuller</a>) that interoperated with the <a href="BitKeeper">BitKeeper</a> source code repository. This was cited as the reason that BitMover revoked a license allowing <a href="Linux">Linux</a> developers free use of their BitKeeper product. <a href="Linus%20Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, the creator of the Linux kernel, and Tridgell were thus involved in a public debate about the events, in which Tridgell stated that, not having bought or owned BitKeeper – and thus having never agreed to its license – he could not violate it, and was analyzing the protocol ethically, as he had done with Samba. Tridgell's involvement in the project resulted in Torvalds accusing him of playing dirty tricks with BitKeeper. Tridgell claimed his analysis started with simply <a href="telnet">telnet</a>ing to a BitKeeper server and typing codice_1.

In 2011 Tridgell got involved with the software development of ArduPilot Mega, an open source Arduino-based UAV controller board, working on an entry for the <a href="UAV%20Outback%20Challenge">UAV Challenge Outback Rescue</a>.

Attending <a href="Barker%20College">Barker College</a> Hornsby, NSW, Tridgell completed his <a href="Higher%20School%20Certificate%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Higher School Certificate</a> in 1984. Tridgell completed a degree with majors in <a href="applied%20mathematics">applied mathematics</a> and <a href="physics">physics</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a> in 1988, before moving to <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> to complete an <a href="Honours%20degree">Honours degree</a> at the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>, in which he received first class honours in <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a>.

Tridgell completed a PhD at the Computer Sciences Laboratory of the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>. His original doctorate work was in the area of <a href="speech%20recognition">speech recognition</a> but was never completed. His submitted dissertation 'Efficient Algorithms for Sorting and Synchronization' was based on his work on the <a href="rsync">rsync</a> algorithm.

Tridgell started his career working for Efam Resources from 1987 to 1988, designing <a href="computer%20modeling">computer models</a> of <a href="financial%20market">financial market</a>s. His work led to a product named The Options Analyst, which he marketed and sold for five years.

From 1988 to 1989, Tridgell worked as a software developer for a company named Sonartech Pty Ltd (now Sonartech Atlas), which developed <a href="sonar">sonar</a> technologies for Australian <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. He worked on <a href="passive%20sonar">passive sonar</a> technology.

Between 1989 and 1990, Tridgell was employed at the Research School of Biological Sciences in the Australian National University, making computer models of physical and biological events and environments such as bushfire spread and <a href="population%20dynamics">population dynamics</a>.

From 1991 to 1999, Tridgell held various other positions at the Australian National University, such as <a href="UNIX">UNIX</a> administration, <a href="satellite">satellite</a> control, and <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a> research. During this period he was seconded to the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Computational Systems, where he headed the PIOuS (Parallel Input/Output System) project—later HiDIOS (High-performance Distributed Input/Output System)—for parallel file systems on the Fujitsu AP1000 and AP+ supercomputers. Tridgell also went on to lecture, first as an associate lecturer, and then as a casual lecturer, in the university's Computer Science division. He remains a Visiting Fellow of the University.

In mid-1999, Tridgell joined the <a href="Levanta">LinuxCare</a> company's office in Canberra as their first Australian employee. He helped to assemble 14 staff for a research and development team known as OzLabs. <a href="Linux">Linux</a> and open-source companies were quite a new concept at this stage. Tridgell was made a research fellow of LinuxCare in 2000.

In March 2001, Tridgell joined <a href="VA%20Software">VA Linux Systems</a>. He worked in the <a href="network-attached%20storage">network-attached storage</a> division for VA Linux Systems, making enhancements to Samba and the <a href="Linux%20kernel">Linux kernel</a> to provide enhanced performance for their network-attached storage device range.

Tridgell continued his work with network-attached storage technologies when he joined <a href="Quantum%20Corporation">Quantum Corporation</a> as a Senior Engineer in the Storage Systems Group. His role once again involved developing functionality and efficiency modifications into Samba to enhance Quantum's GuardianOS-powered <a href="Snap%20Server">Snap Server</a> network-attached storage device. One of the features that he added to Samba at this time was support for <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="Active%20Directory">Active Directory</a> technology, a new authentication system introduced with Microsoft's <a href="Windows%202000">Windows 2000 Server</a> product range.

Applesoft BASIC

Applesoft BASIC is a dialect of <a href="Microsoft%20BASIC">Microsoft BASIC</a>, developed by <a href="Marc%20McDonald">Marc McDonald</a> and <a href="Ric%20Weiland">Ric Weiland</a>, supplied with the <a href="Apple%20II%20series">Apple II series</a> of computers. It supersedes <a href="Integer%20BASIC">Integer BASIC</a> and is the BASIC in <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a> in all Apple II series computers after the original <a href="Apple%20II%23Apple%20II">Apple II</a> model. It is also referred to as FP BASIC (from "<a href="floating%20point">floating point</a>") because of the Disk Operating System (<a href="Apple%20DOS">DOS</a>) command used to invoke it, instead of INT for Integer BASIC. Applesoft BASIC was supplied by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and its name is derived from the names of both <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. Apple employees, including <a href="Randy%20Wigginton">Randy Wigginton</a>, adapted Microsoft's interpreter for the Apple II and added several features. The first version of Applesoft was released in 1977 only on <a href="cassette%20tape">cassette tape</a> and lacked proper support for high-resolution graphics. Applesoft II, which was made available on cassette and disk and in the ROM of the Apple II Plus and subsequent models, was released in 1978. It is this latter version, which has some syntax differences from the first as well as support for the Apple II high-resolution graphics modes, that most people mean by the term "Applesoft".

When <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> wrote <a href="Integer%20BASIC">Integer BASIC</a> for the <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>, he did not implement support for <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> math because he was primarily interested in writing games, a task for which integers alone were sufficient. In 1976, Microsoft had developed <a href="Microsoft%20BASIC">Microsoft BASIC</a>, a BASIC interpreter for the <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">MOS Technology 6502</a>, but at the time there was no production computer that used it. Upon learning that Apple had a 6502 machine, Microsoft asked if the company were interested in licensing BASIC, but <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> replied that Apple already had one. The Apple II was unveiled to the public at the <a href="West%20Coast%20Computer%20Faire">West Coast Computer Faire</a> in April 1977 and became available for sale in June. One of the most common customer complaints about the computer was BASIC's lack of floating-point capability. Integer BASIC is limited to whole numbers between −32768 and 32767 and caused problems for users attempting to write business applications with it. As Wozniak—the only person who understood Integer BASIC well enough to add floating point features—was busy with the <a href="Disk%20II">Disk II</a> drive and controller and with <a href="Apple%20DOS">Apple DOS</a>, Apple turned to Microsoft. Making things more problematic was that the rival <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> and <a href="Commodore%20PET">Commodore PET</a> personal computers both had floating point-capable BASIC interpreters from the beginning. The Applesoft license also saved Microsoft from near-bankruptcy when they licensed BASIC to Commodore for the PET in an agreement that proved unexpectedly costly for them.

Apple reportedly obtained an eight-year license for Applesoft BASIC from Microsoft for a flat fee of $31,000, renewing it in 1985 through an arrangement that gave Microsoft the rights and source code for Apple's <a href="MacBASIC">Macintosh version of BASIC</a>. Applesoft was designed to be backwards-compatible with Integer BASIC and uses the core of Microsoft's 6502 BASIC implementation, which includes using the GET command for detecting key presses and not requiring any spaces on program lines. While Applesoft BASIC is slower than Integer BASIC, it has many features that the older BASIC lacks:
Conversely, Applesoft lacked the codice_9 (remainder) operator that had been present in Integer BASIC.

Adapting BASIC for the Apple II was a tedious job as Apple received a source listing for Microsoft 6502 BASIC which proved to be an extremely buggy mess and also required the addition of Integer BASIC commands. Since Apple had no 6502 assembler on hand, the development team was forced to send the source code over the phone lines to Call Computer, an outfit that offered compiler services. This was an extremely tedious, slow process and after Call Computer lost the source code due to an equipment malfunction, one of the programmers, Cliff Huston, used his own IMSAI 8080 computer to cross assemble the BASIC source.

Applesoft is very similar to Commodore's BASIC 2.0 aside from features inherited from Integer BASIC. There are a few minor differences such as Applesoft's lack of bitwise operators; otherwise most BASIC programs that do not utilize hardware-dependent features will run on both BASICs.

<a href="Coleco">Coleco</a> claimed that its <a href="Coleco%20Adam">Adam</a> home computer's SmartBASIC was source-code compatible with Applesoft. Microsoft licensed a BASIC compatible with Applesoft to <a href="VTech">VTech</a> for its <a href="Laser%20128">Laser 128</a> <a href="Apple%20II%20clone">clone</a>.

Whereas Wozniak originally referred to his Integer BASIC as "Game BASIC" (having written it so he could write a <a href="Breakout%20clone">Breakout clone</a> for his new computer), few <a href="action%20game">action game</a>s were written in Applesoft BASIC for several reasons.

In that era of carefully counting <a href="clock%20cycle">clock cycle</a>s and limited memory, it was inefficient to write speed-dependent programs that ran on a <a href="runtime%20interpreter">runtime interpreter</a>. The use of "real" (floating-point) numbers for all math operations created unnecessary overhead and degraded performance. A common feature of all Microsoft 6502 BASICs is the lack of double-precision variables or true integer math.

BASIC normally always works in single-precision and although a % can be placed after a variable to mark it as integer, its value would merely be converted back into single-precision, slowing down program execution and wasting memory (as each "%" required one extra byte of memory). The integer variable type on Microsoft 6502 BASIC was really only designed for arrays because each element would take two bytes (versus, in the case of Applesoft, five for floating-point).

Additionally, <a href="shape%20table">shape table</a>s were a slow alternative to <a href="bitmap">bitmap</a>s. Shape tables were usually even larger than their respective bitmaps in the amount of bit space they consumed. No provision existed for mixing text and graphics, except for the limited "hardware split screen" of the Apple II (four lines of text at the bottom of the screen). Many graphics programs thus contained their own bitmap character generator routines. No provision was added in the 128 kB <a href="Apple%20IIe">Apple IIe</a> and <a href="Apple%20IIc">Apple IIc</a> models' BASIC interpreters for the new machines' extra memory and double-resolution graphics, or for the <a href="Apple%20IIgs">Apple II's</a> 16-color mode. <a href="Beagle%20Bros">Beagle Bros</a> offered machine-language workarounds for these problems.

Applesoft BASIC programs were stored as a <a href="linked%20list">linked list</a> of lines; a codice_10 or codice_11 took <a href="Computational%20complexity%20theory">O(n) (linear) time</a>, and although Applesoft programs were not very long compared to today's software, on a 1 MHz 6502 this could create a significant bottleneck. Large programs were often written with the most-used subroutines at the top of the program to reduce the processing time for codice_12 calls.

Furthermore, there was no sound support – aside from a codice_13 command that can be used to click the speaker. One can also codice_14 an ASCII <a href="bell%20character">bell character</a> to sound the system alert <a href="beep%20%28sound%29">beep</a>. The language is not fast enough to produce more than a baritone buzz from repeated clicks anyway. Music spanning several octaves can be played by repeated calls to a machine-language tone generator.

Applesoft lacks several commands and functions common to most of the non-6502 Microsoft BASIC interpreters, such as:

Applesoft BASIC can only be extended by two means: the ampersand (&) command and the USR() function. These are two features that called machine-language routines stored in memory. Routines that need to be fast or require direct access to arbitrary functions or data in memory can thus be called from a higher-level interpreted BASIC program. The USR() function takes one numerical argument, and can be programmed to derive and return a calculated function value, to be used in a numerical expression. "&" was effectively a shorthand for CALL, with an address that would be predefined.

The 1978 Applesoft II Manual essentially ignored the & command, merely listing it among reserved words in an appendix, and stating, "The ampersand ( & ) is intended for the computer's internal use only; it is not a proper APPLESOFT command. This symbol, when executed as an instruction, causes an unconditional jump to location $3F5. Use to recover", referring to the command's "hook" address.

The 1982 Applesoft manual for the Apple IIe (also in an appendix) did not call it "improper", and said slightly more about it, adding to the "internal use" clause, "...and for user-supplied machine-language routines", but giving no further documentation beyond describing the hook address. In practice it was possible for an ampersand routine to parse code and arguments that followed the & character by calling routines in the BASIC ROM.

Applesoft, like Integer BASIC before it, does not come with any built-in commands for dealing with files or disks, other than a feature to save programs to, and load programs from, cassette tape. The Apple II disk operating system, known simply as DOS, augments the language to provide such abilities.

Unlike in Integer BASIC, Applesoft BASIC variable names are significant only to two letters; they can be made longer, but only the first two letters are used. For instance, "LOW" and "LOSS" are treated as the same variable, and attempting to assign a value to "LOSS" overwrites any value assigned to "LOW". Furthermore, because the language used <a href="Tokenization%20%28lexical%20analysis%29">tokenization</a>, a programmer has to avoid using any consecutive letters that are also Applesoft commands or operations (one cannot use the name "SCORE" for a variable because it interprets the OR as a Boolean operator, thus rendering it SC OR E, nor can one use "BACKGROUND" because the command "GR" invokes the low-resolution graphics mode, in this case creating a syntax error).

The Apple II high-resolution graphics mode is extremely limited; a user is limited to six colors (black, green, violet, orange, blue, and white), two of which do not appear in odd-numbered columns and two that do not appear in even-numbered ones; and white was a combination of two neighboring pixels, supplanting the individual pixel colors. A hardware hack incorporated into the Apple IIe's 80-column character card expands the mode to higher horizontal resolution and opens up the availability of all 16 colors of the lo-res graphics mode. To its benefit, the language allows for easy use of <a href="vector%20graphics">vector graphics</a>, a feature unavailable in the lower-resolution graphics mode.

A deficiency in Applesoft's error-trapping with ONERR means that the system stack would not be reset if an error-handling routine did not invoke RESUME, potentially leading to a crash. Error-handling that does not employ RESUME can avoid the problem with a CALL -3288 or (equivalent) 62248 before exiting the routine.

Through several early models of the Apple II, Applesoft BASIC does not support the use of <a href="lowercase">lowercase</a> letters in programs, except in strings. (Thus, Applesoft can display lowercase letters, but cannot recognize them as part of a program; thus, codice_14 is a valid command but codice_20 and codice_21 are unrecognizable and result in a syntax error.)

Due to a short-cut in the programming of the overflow test when evaluating 16 bit numbers, entering any number from 437760 to 440319 for a new line number at the BASIC prompt will cause Applesoft to crash, usually to a monitor prompt. Entering "440000" at the prompt has been used to hack games that are protected against entering commands at the prompt after the program is loaded.

The original Applesoft, stored in RAM as documented in its Reference Manual of November 1977, has smaller interpreter code than the later Applesoft II, occupying 8½ kb of memory, instead of the 10 kb used by the later Applesoft II. Consequently, it lacks a number of command features developed for the later, mainstream version:
as well as several the later version would have, that had already been present in Apple's Integer BASIC:
In addition, its low-resolution graphics commands have different names from their Integer BASIC/Applesoft II counterparts. All command names are of the form PLTx such that GR, COLOR=, PLOT, HLIN and VLIN are called PLTG, PLTC, PLTP, PLTH, and PLTV, respectively. The command for returning to text mode, known as TEXT in other versions, is simply TEX, and carries the proviso that it has to be the last statement in a program line.

The USR() function is also defined differently, serving as a stand-in for the absent CALL command. Its argument is not for passing a numerical value to the machine-language routine, but is instead the call-address of the routine itself; there is no "hook" to pre-define the address. All of several examples in the manual use the function only to access "system monitor ROM" routines, or short user-routines to manipulate the ROM routines. No mention is made of any code to calculate the value returned by the function itself; the function is always shown being assigned to "dummy" variables, which, without action to set a value by user-code, just receive a meaningless value handed back to them. Even accessed ROM routines that return values (in examples, those that provide the service of PDL() and SCRN() functions) merely have their values stored, by user-routines, in locations that are separately PEEKed in a subsequent statement.

Unlike in Integer BASIC and Applesoft II, the Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT perform <a href="bitwise%20operation">bitwise operation</a>s on 16-bit integer values. If they are given values outside that range, an error results.

The terms OUT and PLT (and the aforementioned IN) appear in the list of reserved words, but are not explained anywhere in the manual.

<a href="Hello%20World">Hello World</a> in Applesoft BASIC can be entered as the following:

Multiple commands can be included on the same line of code if separated by a colon (codice_22). The codice_23 can be used in Applesoft BASIC (and almost all versions of Microsoft BASIC) as a shortcut for "PRINT", though spelling out the word is not only acceptable but canonical—Applesoft converted "?" in entered programs to the same token as "PRINT" (thus no memory is actually saved by using "?"), thus either appears as "PRINT" when a program is listed. The program above appears in a codice_24 command as:

When Applesoft II BASIC was initially released in mid-1978, it came on cassette tape and could be loaded into memory via the Apple II's machine language monitor. When the enhanced Apple II+ replaced the original II in 1979, Applesoft was now included in ROM and automatically started on power-up if no bootable floppy disk was present. Conversely, Integer BASIC was now removed from ROM and turned into an executable file on the DOS 3.3 disk.

Microsoft and Apple each developed their own versions of BASIC for the <a href="Apple%20III">Apple III</a> computer. Apple III Microsoft BASIC was designed to run on the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> platform available for the Apple III. Apple Business BASIC, meanwhile, shipped with the Apple III. Donn Denman ported Applesoft BASIC to <a href="Apple%20SOS">SOS</a> and reworked it to take advantage of the extended memory of the Apple III.

Both languages introduced a number of new or improved features over Applesoft II, some of the same features as each other, and some unique to each. Both languages replace Applesoft II's single-precision floating-point variables using 5-byte storage with the somewhat-reduced-pecision 4-byte variables, while also adding a larger numerical format. Apple III Microsoft BASIC provides double-precision floating-point variables, taking 8 bytes of storage, while Apple Business BASIC offers an extra-long integer type, also taking 8 bytes for storage. Both languages also retain 2-byte integers, and maximum 255-character strings.

Other new features common to both languages include:

Differences of the same features:
Features specific to each language are described separately below.


There is no support for graphics provided within the language, nor for reading analog controls or buttons; nor is there a means of defining the active window of the text screen.

Apple Business BASIC eliminates all references to absolute memory addresses. Thus, the POKE command and PEEK() function were not included in the language, and new features replaced the CALL statement and USR() function. Functionality of certain features in Applesoft that had been achieved with various PEEK and POKE locations is now provided by:

External binary subroutines and functions are now loaded into memory by a single INVOKE disk-command that loads separately-assembled code modules, listing the names of all files to be used. A PERFORM statement is then used to call an INVOKEd procedure by name, with an argument-list. INVOKEd functions would be referenced in expressions by EXFN. (floating-point) or EXFN%. (integer), with the function name appended, plus the argument-list for the function.

Graphics are supported with an INVOKEd module, with features including displaying text within graphics in various fonts, within four different graphics modes available on the Apple III, including the precursor of Apple IIe's double-high-resolution mode.

Asterix

Asterix or The Adventures of Asterix ( or "Astérix le Gaulois", ) is a series of <a href="French%20comics">French comics</a>. The series first appeared in the <a href="Franco-Belgian%20comics">Franco-Belgian comics</a> magazine "<a href="Pilote">Pilote</a>" on 29 October 1959. It was written by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Goscinny">René Goscinny</a> and illustrated by <a href="Albert%20Uderzo">Albert Uderzo</a> until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company <a href="Hachette%20%28publisher%29">Hachette</a>. As of 2015, 36 volumes have been released.

The series follows the adventures of a village of indomitable <a href="Gauls">Gauls</a> as they resist <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> occupation in <a href="50%20BC">50 BC</a>. They do so by means of a magic potion brewed by their <a href="druid">druid</a> Panoramix, named Getafix in the English translations, which temporarily gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonists, the title character <a href="Asterix%20%28character%29">Asterix</a>, along with his friend <a href="Obelix">Obelix</a> have various adventures. The "ix" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish "ix" names in the series) alludes to the "rix" suffix (meaning "king") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as <a href="Vercingetorix">Vercingetorix</a>, <a href="Orgetorix">Orgetorix</a> and <a href="Dumnorix">Dumnorix</a> (See <a href="Asterix%23Character%20names">below</a> for further explanations of the character names). Many of the stories have them travel to foreign countries, though others are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.

The "Asterix" series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most European countries.

The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20films">13 films</a>: nine animated, and four live action (one of which, "", was <a href="Lists%20of%20highest-grossing%20films%20in%20France">a major box office success in France</a>). There have also been a number of <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20games">games</a> based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, <a href="Parc%20Ast%C3%A9rix">Parc Astérix</a>. The very first French satellite, <a href="Ast%C3%A9rix%20%28satellite%29">Astérix</a>, launched in 1965, was also named after the comics character. As of October 2009, 325 million copies of 34 "Asterix" books had been sold worldwide, making co-creators René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo France's bestselling authors abroad.

Prior to creating the "Asterix" series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series "<a href="Oumpah-pah">Oumpah-pah</a>", which was published in "<a href="Tintin%20%28magazine%29">Tintin</a>" magazine.

"Astérix" was originally serialised in "<a href="Pilote">Pilote</a>" magazine, in the very first issue published on 29 October 1959. In 1961 the first book was put together, titled "<a href="Asterix%20the%20Gaul">Asterix the Gaul</a>". From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's "Asterix and the Big Fight" sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth "Asterix" volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.

Uderzo's first sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind. He visualized Asterix as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength. However, Uderzo felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born. Despite the growing popularity of "Asterix" with the readers, the financial backing for "Pilote" ceased. "Pilote" was taken over by <a href="Dargaud">Georges Dargaud</a>.

When Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue. He continued the series but on a less frequent basis. Most critics and fans of the series prefer Goscinny's albums. Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions <a href="Albert-Ren%C3%A9">Albert-René</a>, which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then. However, <a href="Dargaud">Dargaud</a>, the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).

In December 2008, Uderzo sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company.

In a letter published in the French newspaper "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" in 2009, Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new "Astérix" adventures after his death. She said "...the co-creator of "Astérix", France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance”. However, René Goscinny's daughter Anne also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time. She is reported to have said that ""Asterix" has already had two lives: one during my father's lifetime and one after it. Why not a third?". A few months later, Uderzo appointed three illustrators, who had been his assistants for many years, to continue the series. In 2011, Uderzo announced that a new "Asterix" album was due out in 2013, with <a href="Jean-Yves%20Ferri">Jean-Yves Ferri</a> writing the story and <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20M%C3%A9barki">Frédéric Mébarki</a> drawing it. A year later, in 2012, the publisher Albert-René announced that Frédéric Mébarki had withdrawn from drawing the new album, due to the pressure he felt in following in the steps of Uderzo. Comic artist <a href="Didier%20Conrad">Didier Conrad</a> was officially announced to take over drawing duties from Mébarki, with the due date of the new album in 2013 unchanged.

In January 2015, after the murders of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly Charlie Hebdo, presumably for their controversial work, "Astérix" creator Albert Uderzo came out of retirement to draw two "Astérix" pictures honouring the memories of the victims.

Numbers 1–24, 32 and 34 are by Goscinny and Uderzo. Numbers 25–31 and 33 are by Uderzo alone. Years stated are for their initial <a href="Comic%20albums">album</a> release. Numbers 35–37 are by <a href="Jean-Yves%20Ferri">Jean-Yves Ferri</a> and <a href="Didier%20Conrad">Didier Conrad</a>.


"<a href="Asterix%20Conquers%20Rome">Asterix Conquers Rome</a>" is a comics adaptation of the animated film "<a href="The%20Twelve%20Tasks%20of%20Asterix">The Twelve Tasks of Asterix</a>". It was released in 1976, and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canonical</a> to the series. The only English translations ever to be published were in the "Asterix Annual 1980" and as a standalone volume in 1984.

In 2007, Les Editions Albert René released a tribute volume titled "<a href="Ast%C3%A9rix%20et%20ses%20Amis">Astérix et ses Amis</a>", a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories. It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists. The volume was translated into nine languages. , it has not been translated into English.

The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village (rumoured to be inspired by <a href="Erquy">Erquy</a>) in <a href="Armorica">Armorica</a> (present-day <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>), a province of <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> (modern France), in the year 50 BC. Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Republic. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters%23Getafix">Getafix</a>. His chief is <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters%23Vitalstatistix">Vitalstatistix</a>.

The main protagonist and hero of the village is <a href="Asterix%20%28character%29">Asterix</a>, who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and slower thinking friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength (because of this, Getafix steadily refuses to allow Obelix to drink the potion, as doing so would have a dangerous and unpredictable result). Obelix is usually accompanied by <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters%23Dogmatix">Dogmatix</a>, his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix's dog's name is "Dogmatix" in English, but "Idéfix" in the original French edition.)

Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul (<a href="Lutetia">Lutetia</a>, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> etc.), neighbouring nations (Belgium, Spain, <a href="Great%20Britain">Britain</a>, Germany etc.), and far away lands (North America, Middle East, India etc.).

The series employs <a href="science-fiction">science-fiction</a> and <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of <a href="extraterrestrials">extraterrestrials</a> in "<a href="Asterix%20and%20the%20Falling%20Sky">Asterix and the Falling Sky</a>" and the city of <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> in "<a href="Asterix%20and%20Obelix%20All%20at%20Sea">Asterix and Obelix All at Sea</a>".

The humour encountered in the "Asterix" comics is often centring on puns, caricatures, and <a href="tongue-in-cheek">tongue-in-cheek</a> <a href="stereotype">stereotype</a>s of contemporary European nations and <a href="List%20of%20regions%20in%20France">French regions</a>. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix's famous ""Ils sont fous ces romains"" ("These Romans are crazy") is translated as "Sono pazzi questi romani", alluding to the Roman abbreviation "<a href="SPQR">SPQR</a>". In another example: <a href="Hiccups">Hiccups</a> are written <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeically</a> in French as "hips", but in English as "hic", allowing Roman legionaries in at least one of the English translations to <a href="declension">decline</a> their hiccups in Latin ("hic, haec, hoc"). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.

All the fictional characters in "Asterix" have names which are puns on their roles or personalities and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality. Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an '-ix' suffix for the males and ending in '-a' for the females, for example, Chief <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters%23Vitalstatistix">Vitalstatistix</a> (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters%23Impedimenta">Impedimenta</a> (often at odds with the chief). The male Roman names end in '-us', echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters%23Romans">Gluteus Maximus</a>, a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the <a href="gluteus%20maximus">butt</a> of the joke. Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in "-ic", after Gothic chiefs such as <a href="Alaric%20%28disambiguation%29">Alaric</a> and <a href="Theoderic">Theoderic</a>, for example <a href="Rhetoric">Rhetoric</a> the interpreter. Greek names end in "-os" or "-es"; for example, <a href="Thermos">Thermos</a> the restaurateur. British names end in "-ax" and are often puns on the <a href="taxation">taxation</a> associated with the later <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, such as <a href="Value%20added%20tax">Valuaddedtax</a> the druid and <a href="Selective%20employment%20tax">Selectivemploymentax</a> the mercenary. Other nationalities are treated to <a href="Pidgin">Pidgin</a> translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning <a href="eggs%20and%20bacon">eggs and bacon</a>, is often guidebook Spanish for tourists) or literary and other popular media references, like <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters%23Caricatures">Dubbelosix</a> (a reference to <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a>'s codename 007).

Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation, for example, the druid <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters%23Getafix">Getafix</a> is "Panoramix" in the original French and "Miraculix" in German. Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved: Obelix's dog, known in the original French as "Idéfix" (from "idée fixe", a "fixed idea" or obsession), is called "Dogmatix" in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely ("dogmatic") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable "Dog-" at the beginning of the name.

The name "Asterix", <a href="French%20language">French</a> "Astérix", comes from ', meaning "<a href="asterisk">asterisk</a>", which is the typographical symbol *"' indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ ("aster"), meaning a "star". His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>s. For example, in <a href="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, <a href="Slovene%20language">Slovene</a>, <a href="Latvian%20language">Latvian</a>, and <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> it is "Asteriks" (in Turkish he was first named "Bücür" meaning "shorty", but the name was then changed). Two exceptions include <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a>, in which he is known as "Ástríkur" ("Rich of love") and <a href="Sinhalese%20Language">Sinhalese</a>, where he is known as සූර පප්පා ("Soora Pappa"), which can be interpreted as "<a href="Hero">Hero</a>".

For explanations of some of the other names, see <a href="List%20of%20Asterix%20characters">List of "Asterix" characters</a>.

Many of the Asterix adventures take place in other countries aside from their homeland, Gaul. In every album that takes place abroad they meet (usually modern-day) stereotypes for each country as seen by the French.

When the Gauls see foreigners speaking their foreign languages, these have different representation in the speech bubbles:


The various volumes have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects. Besides the original French language, most albums are available in Estonian, English, Czech, Dutch, German, Galician, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese, Italian, modern Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Slovene, Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, Latvian, Welsh as well as Latin.

Some albums have also been translated into languages such as Esperanto, Scottish Gaelic, Scots, Indonesian, Persian, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Frisian, Romansch, Vietnamese, Sinhalese, Ancient Greek and even Luxembourgish.

In France, Finland, and especially in Germany, several volumes were translated into a variety of regional <a href="language">language</a>s and <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s, such as <a href="Alsatian%20language">Alsatian</a>, <a href="Breton%20language">Breton</a>, Chtimi (<a href="Picard%20language">Picard</a>) and <a href="Corsican%20language">Corsican</a> in France, <a href="Austro-Bavarian%20language">Bavarian</a>, <a href="Swabian%20German">Swabian</a> and <a href="Low%20German">Low German</a> in Germany, and <a href="Savonian%20dialects">Savo</a>, <a href="Karelia">Karelia</a>, <a href="Rauma%2C%20Finland">Rauma</a> and <a href="Helsinki%20slang">Helsinki slang</a> dialects in Finland. Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume, <a href="Asterix%20the%20Gaul">Asterix the Gaul</a>, was translated into local language <a href="Mirandese">Mirandese</a>. In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the <a href="Cretan%20Greek">Cretan Greek</a>, <a href="Cypriot%20Greek">Cypriot Greek</a> and <a href="Pontic%20Greek">Pontic Greek</a> dialects. In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the <a href="Romanesco%20dialect">Romanesque</a> dialect. In former Yugoslavia, "Forum" publishing house translated Corsican in "<a href="Asterix%20in%20Corsica">Asterix in Corsica</a>" into Montenegrin dialect of <a href="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a> (today called <a href="Montenegrin%20language">Montenegrin language</a>).

In the Netherlands several volumes were translated into <a href="West%20Frisian%20language">West Frisian</a>, a language related to English spoken in the province of <a href="Friesland">Friesland</a>, into <a href="Limburgish%20language">Limburgish</a>, a regional language spoken not only in <a href="Limburg%20%28Netherlands%29">Dutch Limburg</a> but also in <a href="Limburg%20%28Belgium%29">Belgian Limburg</a> and <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany</a> and into <a href="Tweants%20dialect">Tweants</a>, a dialect in the region of <a href="Twente">Twente</a> in the eastern province of <a href="Overijssel">Overijssel</a>. Hungarian-language books have been issued in <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> for the <a href="Magyars">Hungarian</a> minority living in <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. Although not a fully autonomous dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into <a href="Sinhalese%20language">Sinhala</a> ("Singhalese") as Sura Pappa, the only Sri Lankan translation of a foreign cartoon that managed to keep the spirit of the original series intact.

Most volumes have been translated into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Attic%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> with accompanying teachers' guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages.

The translation of the books into English has been done by <a href="Derek%20Hockridge">Derek Hockridge</a> and <a href="Anthea%20Bell">Anthea Bell</a>, and their English language rendition has been widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French version.

The series has been adapted into various media. There are 13 films, 15 board games, 40 video games, and 1 theme park

Various <a href="motion%20picture">motion picture</a>s based upon the series have been made.


Many <a href="gamebook">gamebook</a>s, <a href="board%20game">board game</a>s and <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s are based upon the "Asterix" series. In particular, many video games were released by various computer game publishers.

<a href="Parc%20Ast%C3%A9rix">Parc Astérix</a>, a theme park 22 miles north of Paris, based upon the series, was opened in 1989. It is one of the most visited sites in France, with around 1.6 million visitors per year.

The Cardinals were founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898, and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United States. The Cardinals play their home games at the <a href="University%20of%20Phoenix%20Stadium">University of Phoenix Stadium</a>, which is located in the northwestern suburb of <a href="Glendale%2C%20Arizona">Glendale, Arizona</a>.

The team was established in <a href="History%20of%20the%20Chicago%20Cardinals">Chicago</a> in 1898 and was a charter member of the NFL in . Along with the <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a>, the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in operation since the league's founding.

The club then moved to <a href="History%20of%20the%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20%28NFL%29">St. Louis</a> in and played in that city through (sometimes referred to as the "Football Cardinals" or the "Big Red" to avoid confusion with the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>).

In , the club began playing all home games at the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, although the team's training facility is in <a href="Tempe%2C%20Arizona">Tempe</a>.

The franchise has won two NFL championships, both while it was based in Chicago. The first occurred in , but is the subject of <a href="1925%20NFL%20Championship%20controversy">controversy</a>, with supporters of the <a href="Pottsville%20Maroons">Pottsville Maroons</a> believing that Pottsville should have won the title. Their second title, and the first to be won in a <a href="History%20of%20the%20National%20Football%20League%20championship">championship game</a>, came in , nearly two decades before the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20I">first</a> <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>. They returned to the title game to defend in <a href="1948%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">1948</a>, but lost the rematch 7–0 in a snowstorm in Philadelphia. With Dean Bickerstaff 

Since winning the <a href="1947%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">championship in 1947</a>, the team suffered many losing seasons, and currently holds <a href="List%20of%20NFL%20franchise%20post-season%20droughts">the longest active championship drought</a> of North American sports at 68 consecutive seasons after <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> ended their <a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Billy%20Goat">108 year drought</a> in 2016. In <a href="2012%20NFL%20season">2012</a> the Cardinals became the first NFL franchise to lose 700 games since its inception. The franchise's all-time win-loss record (including <a href="National%20Football%20League%20regular%20season">regular season</a> and <a href="National%20Football%20League%20playoffs">playoff</a> games) at the conclusion of the <a href="2016%20NFL%20season">2016 season</a> is ( in the regular season, in the playoffs). They have been to the playoffs ten times and have won seven playoff games, three of which were victories during their run in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NFL%20playoffs">2008–09 NFL playoffs</a>. During that season, they won their only <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a> since the 1970 <a href="AFL%E2%80%93NFL%20merger">AFL–NFL merger</a>, and reached <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLIII">Super Bowl XLIII</a> (losing 27–23 to the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>). The team has also won five division titles (, , , and ) since their 1947–48 NFL championship game appearances. The Cardinals are the only NFL team who have never lost a playoff game at home, with a 5–0 record: the <a href="1947%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">1947 NFL Championship Game</a>, two postseason victories during the aforementioned 2008–09 NFL playoffs, one during the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NFL%20playoffs">2009–10 playoffs</a>, and one during the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20NFL%20playoffs">2015–16 playoffs</a>.

From 1988 through 2012 (except 2005, when they trained in <a href="Prescott%2C%20Arizona">Prescott</a>), the Cardinals conducted their annual summer training camp at <a href="Northern%20Arizona%20University">Northern Arizona University</a> in <a href="Flagstaff%2C%20Arizona">Flagstaff</a>. The Cardinals moved their training camp to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2013. The stadium was the site of the <a href="2015%20Pro%20Bowl">2015 Pro Bowl</a>, unlike in past years, where it was held at <a href="Aloha%20Stadium">Aloha Stadium</a> in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. The stadium also played host to Super Bowls <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLII">XLII</a> and <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLIX">XLIX</a>.

The franchise's inception dates back to 1898, when a neighborhood group gathered to play in the <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> <a href="South%20Side%2C%20Chicago">South Side</a>, calling themselves Morgan Athletic Club. Chicago painting and building contractor <a href="Chris%20O%27Brien%20%28American%20football%29">Chris O'Brien</a> acquired the team, which he relocated to <a href="Normal%20Park">Normal Field</a> on Racine Avenue. The team was known as Racine Normals until 1901, when O'Brien bought used jerseys from the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. He described the faded <a href="maroon">maroon</a> clothing as "<a href="Cardinal%20%28color%29">Cardinal red</a>" and the team became the Racine Street Cardinals. The team eventually became in 1920 a charter member of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which two years later was rechristened to <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL). The team entered the league as the Racine Cardinals, however the name was changed in 1922 to Chicago Cardinals to avoid confusion with the <a href="Racine%20Legion">Horlick-Racine Legion</a> who entered the league the same year. Except for <a href="1925%20NFL%20season">1925</a>, when they were awarded the championship after the <a href="Pottsville%20Maroons">Pottsville Maroons</a> were suspended, the Cardinals experienced only minimal success on the playing field during their first 26 seasons in the league. During the post-World War II years, the team reached two straight NFL finals against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, winning in <a href="1947%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">1947</a> – eight months after the death of owner <a href="Charles%20Bidwill">Charles Bidwill</a> – and losing the following year. After years of bad seasons and losing fans to the cross-town rivals <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a>, by the late 1950s the Cardinals were almost bankrupt, and owner <a href="Violet%20Bidwill%20Wolfner">Violet Bidwill Wolfner</a> became interested in a relocation.

Due to the formation of the rival <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a>, the NFL allowed Bidwill to relocate the team to <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, Missouri, where they became the <a href="History%20of%20the%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20%28NFL%29">St. Louis Cardinals</a> (locally, they were called the "Big Red" or the "Football Cardinals" in order to avoid confusion with the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">baseball team</a>). During the Cardinals' 28-year stay in St. Louis, they advanced to the playoffs just three times (1974, 1975 & 1982), never hosting or winning in any appearance. The overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with a then-<a href="Busch%20Memorial%20Stadium">21-year-old stadium</a>, caused game attendance to dwindle, and owner <a href="Bill%20Bidwill">Bill Bidwill</a> decided to move the team to Arizona.

Not long after the <a href="1987%20NFL%20season">1987 NFL season</a>, Bidwill agreed to move to the <a href="Phoenix%20metropolitan%20area">Phoenix metropolitan area</a> on a handshake deal with state and local officials, and the team became the Phoenix Cardinals. The franchise changed its geographic name from Phoenix to Arizona on March 17, 1994. (Interestingly, the franchise has never played in the city of Phoenix proper.) The <a href="1998%20NFL%20season">1998 NFL season</a> saw the Cardinals break two long droughts, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in 16 years. The team got their first postseason win since <a href="1947%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">1947</a> by winning the <a href="NFL%20playoffs%2C%201998-99">Wild Card Playoffs</a>. <a href="2008%20NFL%20season">In 2008</a>, the Cardinals won the <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a> to advance to the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> for the first time in franchise history. They lost <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLIII">Super Bowl XLIII</a> 27–23 to the <a href="2008%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> in the final seconds.

After their historic 2008 season, the Cardinals posted a 10–6 record in 2009, their first season with 10 wins in Arizona. The Cardinals clinched their second consecutive <a href="NFC%20West">NFC West</a> title, and were defeated by eventual Super Bowl champion <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> 45–14 in the divisional playoffs. The next time they would make the playoffs would be in <a href="2014%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season">2014</a>, when they ended up as a wild card. They set the best regular-season record in the team's history in Arizona at 11–5, but were defeated by the 7–8–1 <a href="NFC%20South">NFC South</a> champions <a href="2014%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">Carolina Panthers</a>.

The next year, the Cardinals set a franchise-best 13–3 record, and clinched their first-ever first-round playoff bye as the NFC's second seed. They defeated the <a href="2015%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season">Green Bay Packers</a> 26–20 in overtime, giving quarterback <a href="Carson%20Palmer">Carson Palmer</a> his first playoff victory. The Cardinals then advanced to their second <a href="NFC%20Championship%20Game">NFC Championship Game</a> in their history, but were blown out by the top-seeded 15–1 <a href="2015%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season">Panthers</a> 49–15, committing seven turnovers.

Starting in , the team had a logo of a <a href="Northern%20cardinal">cardinal bird</a> perched on the stitches of a football.

The Cardinals moved to Arizona in , and the <a href="flag%20of%20Arizona">flag of Arizona</a> was added to the sleeves the following year. In , the team began wearing red pants with their white jerseys, as new coach <a href="Joe%20Bugel">Joe Bugel</a> wanted to emulate his former employer, the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>, who at the time wore burgundy pants with their white jerseys (the Redskins later returned to their 1970s gold pants with all their jerseys).

In , the Cardinals participated in the NFL's 75th anniversary throwback uniform program. The jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s Chicago Cardinals, with an interlocking "CC" logo and three stripes on each sleeve. The uniform numbers were relocated to the right chest. The pants were khaki to simulate the color and material used in that era. The Cardinals also stripped the logos from their helmets for the two games, at Cleveland (Sept. 18) and home vs. Pittsburgh (Oct. 30).

The Cardinal head on the helmet was repeated on the white jersey from 1982 to 1995. In 1996, the state flag of Arizona was moved higher on the sleeve after the Cardinal head was eliminated, and black was removed as an accent color, instead replaced with a blue to match the predominant color of the state flag. In 2002, the Cardinals began to wear all-red and all-white combinations, and continued to do so through 2004, prior to the team's makeover.

In , the team unveiled its first major changes in a century. The cardinal-head logo was updated to look sleeker and meaner than its predecessor. Numerous fans had derisively called the previous version a "<a href="parakeet">parakeet</a>". Black again became an accent color after an eight-year absence, while trim lines were added to the outside shoulders, sleeves, and sides of the jerseys and pants. Both the red and white jerseys have the option of red or white pants.

Hoping to break a six-game losing streak, the Cardinals wore the red pants for the first time on October 29, 2006, in a game at <a href="Lambeau%20Field">Lambeau Field</a> against the Green Bay Packers. The Packers won 31–14, and the Cards headed into their bye week with a 1–7 mark. Following the bye week, the Cardinals came out in an all-red combination at home against the Dallas Cowboys and lost, 27–10. Arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and won four of their last seven games. However, the following season, in , the Cardinals again wore their red pants for their final 3 home games. They wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks. They paired red pants with red jerseys, the all-red combination, for home games against the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, and St. Louis Rams. The red pants were not worn at all in , but they were used in home games vs. Seattle, Minnesota, and St. Louis in . The red pants were paired with the white road jersey for the first time in three years during a 2010 game at Carolina, but the white jersey/red pants combination has not been used since.

The Cardinals' first home game in Arizona, in 1988, saw them play in red jerseys. Thereafter, for the next 18 years in Arizona, the Cardinals, like a few other NFL teams in warm climates, wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season—forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys during Arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C). However, this tradition did not continue when the Cardinals moved from Sun Devil Stadium to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006, as early-season games (and some home games late in the season) were played with the roof closed. With the temperature inside at a comfortable 70 °F (21 °C), the team opted to wear red jerseys at home full-time. The Cardinals wore white jerseys at home for the first time in University of Phoenix Stadium on August 29, 2008, in a preseason game against the <a href="Denver%20Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>.

The Cardinals wore white at home for the first time in a regular season game at University of Phoenix Stadium against the <a href="Houston%20Texans">Houston Texans</a> on October 11, . In October 2009, the NFL recognized <a href="Breast%20Cancer%20Awareness%20Month">Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a>, and players wore pink-accented items, including gloves, wristbands, and shoes. The team thought the pink accents looked better with white uniforms than with red.

From 1970 through 1983, and again in many seasons between 1989 and 2002, the Cardinals would wear white when hosting the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> in order to force the Cowboys to don their "jinxed" blue jerseys. They have not done this since moving into University of Phoenix Stadium, however.

The season saw the Cardinals debut a new, alternate black jersey. Prior to its introduction, the Cardinals were the only NFL team without an alternate jersey or throwback kit, save for the NFL's 75th anniversary program in 1994.
